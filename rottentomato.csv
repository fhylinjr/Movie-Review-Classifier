"Casino Royale aka The Adventures of the Sneaky Man. One of the best spy movies I've seen. It's an incredible put together movie with great writing and amazing action sequences. It really captures the essence of James Bond. The story is really great and asks all the concentration from you in order to process everything that is happening. It's also great how the story doesn't need forced plot twists to make you open-mouthed, and tough it has it's less smart moments it's overall really well written. It's also to praise the fact that Bond actually got a character arch in this movie and his character had a depth that I haven't seen before in a 007 movie. Going into this I definitely didn't thought that the Sneky Man would have feelings, but i was wrong! The cinematography is fantastic, and that opening scene shot in black and white makes us feel like we're watching an old school Bond movie and that is pure cinema. The movie looks so freaking cool and crisp. Craig is a fucking badass and he is in his way to cement his legacy as the best actor to play in the shoes of the 00 agent James Bond. Mads Mikkelsen is also a fantastic villain. Overall the cast was filled with badass people that nailed their roles. I really don't think it can get much better than this regarding Bond movies, but nonetheless I'm still looking forward to see No Time to Die. ""The name's Bond, James Bond.""",positive
"Casino Royale is filled with action, drama and strong plot points throughout - and Daniel Craig's first performance as James Bond is one of his bests.",positive
"James Bond is acted decently, the film however is not decent. Certain scenes are dragged out, certain plot points are just plain silly. Avoid.",negative
"Daniel Craig begins his outings as Bond, James bond, and does it satisfying action and a darker rebooted bond.",positive
"And now to Daniel Craig. I remember all the flack when they announced him as the new Bond (blonde and blue eyes, how dare they?) and then he comes out of the gate with (spoilers!) the best Bond film? Well paced, holds up well fifteen years later, and a perfect reinvigoration of the franchise. I liked Brosnan even though the last few movies were outright terrible. This one is just a great movie.",positive
"In anticipation of #NoTimeToDie, reliving Daniel Craig's marvelous debut as 007 — nearly 15 years ago — back on the big screen in #CasinoRoyale 🎰 I remember it was such a scandal that someone with blond hair *gasp* was cast as James Bond... but then he emerged from that ocean 😂",positive
"I must admit my skepticism of Daniel Craig as the latest Bond but he does a convincing job in his first film as 007. This Bond origin story dispenses with spy toys, playfulness and camp in favor of a more serious tone. It also makes Bond less of a hero figure and more of a conflicted and very skilled assassin. Jason Bourne comes across as having more of a hero persona. Fans of modern action films will enjoy this new version of Bond but Bond aficionados (of which I must admit I am not) may not enjoy it as much.",negative
"My favourite bond film of the 21st century. Maintains audience engagement throughout its course. Magnificent soundtrack and exceptional cinematography. Locations were well chosen and more importantly, well shot. For me, the beach scene in Barbados is the most memorable moment in Casino Royale.",positive
"The best Bond movie in decades, ""Casino Royale"" takes the franchise to much more extreme and serious lengths, ditching the goofiness of previous installments to create a more fresh and realistic film that hits all the right notes that it should while also coming up with a completely new beat.",positive
"Whilst none really stand up to much scrutiny, this is certainly the best Bond film of recent times and arguably the best of them all.",positive
"The original James Bond series as created by Ian Fleming feature a spy who lives the high life as he does his spy work, killing a few evildoers and making love to several women in the process. There were some gadgets, though not necessarily flashy ones, and Bond wasn't always full of wisecracks like he would be in the later movies. The idea might have been that the later movies were too full of wisecracks and fancy gadgets and they were toning it down. But they ended up overdoing it and turning Bond into basically a glorified serial killer. The older movies did have Bond do killing and blowing up of villains' installations. But in this movie, Bond kills willy-nilly, often without real necessity. On top of that, the scenes at the gambling table and his romance with the (supposed) heroine go on for too long. Bond may be young and inexperienced, but no wisecracks at all? We might as well be watching a ""Bourne"" movie.",negative
The movie is awesome from the first movie of Daniel craig and the amazing scene of the casino,positive
"Craig's first and best Bond. He filled the well worn shoes superbly whilst adding his own muscly take. A strong narrative, breathless stunts and insane action set pieces make this our favourite ever 007 film. Royalty.",positive
"A perfect origin story for Bond, James Bond.",positive
Some laughable silliness but not without merit.,negative
The creation of the legend.,positive
"What more can one say about this? He reinvented James Bond with Casino Royal and brought him into the 21st century with his emotionality and humanity. For me, he is now the best James Bond.",positive
"Daniel Craig's first outing 007 was great. Rebooting a franchise can be a tricky thing to do especially a long running one like the James Bond Franchise but with its tough, gritty, and more realistic tone, Daniel Craig comes in and knocks it out of the park and it's understandable why Casino Royale is one of the best in the Franchise.",positive
Overrated! Craig is a misfit for the traditional 007,negative
"Casino Royale is a masterpiece and it is still Daniel Craig's best Bond movie to date, with the only real competition being Skyfall IMO. Daniel Craig's performance as Bond in this movie was absolutely amazing, you know he is great when he overshadows Mads Mikkelsen, who also was amazing in this movie. The action is top notch, along with the storyline and the writing. Overall, Casino Royale is an amazing movie and it's my personal favourite Bond movie ever made.",positive
"Ah yes, The Bourne Identity one. This may borrow certainly from the Bourne movies, but it improves upon them and writing wise, it adapts from the book (Casino Royale) faithfully. This is one of the more serious entries and I absolutely love that. The action is shot coherently and the shots are held just long enough for us to see what is happening. The set pieces themselves are among the best in the franchise and this one film has a few of them. They are all great. Daniel Craig is fantastic in the role. Not my favourite bond, not even in my top 3, but he's still really good. All of the official actors that played the character brought something to the role that none of the other do quite as well. Craig has the best run. He just does. I hadn't notice before, and thought he only started doing this in his later films, but he mutters here. It is a negative, I am unable to sometimes make out what he was saying if not for watching with subtitles. Vesper is a fantastic Bond girl, but if there were any negatives I have for this otherwise masterpiece it is that Bond falling for her felt a bit forced. Not too forced, in the end, it still is believable, I just needed a bit more time with them together is all for it to fully 100% connect with me.",positive
"A fun movie, though I feel like the Daniel Craig series takes itself too seriously sometimes. This is certainly the start of it. The action scenes were great of course.",negative
My favorite Bond film and one of my all-time favorite movies ever!,positive
"Casino Royale is a 4-star 100 minute movie stretched out to a painfully long 160 minutes, and that's a shame. The story is pretty good, the villains, while not memorable, are certainly intimidating, the action scenes are solid and the movie's technical merits are quite good. While it certainly got tiresome after a while, Craig's more realistic and Anti-Fun Loving take on Bond certainly helps make this movie feel like an entirely different beast than those from before, and one that you could genuinely take seriously. Craig's performance is a strong dramatic one, and he does have the gravitas required to carry a movie with this dark and aggressive of a tone. The main problem with the movie is that it just feels endless; I remember watching this in numerous 30 minute chunks and even then I was feeling the weight of it. If you like a more serious tone with your Action movie, then Casino Royale is certainly going to deliver - it's not as ambitious as Batman Begins, the movie that it clearly took inspiration from (that being the ""Gritty Reboot"" of a franchise), but it's certainly good at what it does, for the most part.",negative
This movie may have saved the Bond Franchise!,positive
Critic is always a personal point of view. And in my opinion all Craig´s 007 movies are just generic action boring movies that uses James Bond brand for market reasons.,negative
A fresh new take on the James Bond films. Action film with many surprises and plot twists. And many would-be predictable moments don't go as you'd think. Loved this move!,positive
"Utilizing Martin Campbell's gift for directing practical action scenes and Daniel Craig's gift for a brutal yet suave performance, Casino Royale tops the Bond legacy and delivers one of the best modern action flicks.",positive
"The best Bond movie ever made in my opinion. Everything here just works so well - Daniel Craig's introduction as James Bond is just so badass; Mads Mikkelsen's villain is desperate and terrifying, the action is well-shot and heart pumping; and Chris Cornell's ""You Know My Name"" is a fantastic Bond song.",positive
"The best Bond movie of all time, and shows Daniel is the best Bond as well. Cinema at its finest.",positive
"This is not one of my favorite bond movies. Casino Royale is the most overrated Bond movie ever. Though I do think it's a good movie. Daniel Craig is excellent as James Bond. Eva Green is great in the movie, and she's the 2nd hottest woman in a Bond movie behind Denise Richards. Great acting and some good action sequences, But the story is very slow-paced and the way things need to happen is a little bland, and even the ending has problems involving character decisions. Plus they changed a lot of things from all the other Bond movies which they really shouldn't have done. Overrall, I like Casino Royale. But it's nowhere near as good as people make it out to be.",negative
The rest of the world loves this film. None of it works for me.,negative
"Bad story telling, unlikeable characters, weak and over-the-top actions scenes, blue steel all the way, long boring poker scenes, unrealistic plot lines.",negative
"Exhilarating, fresh, serious, intense, and Daniel Craig delivers a performance for the ages, not just as James Bond, but a cinematic legend is born. If you prefer the campy, gadget-ridden, melodramatic and unbelievable Bonds of the past, this is not the Bond for you. This Bond is human (he hurts, he bleeds, he loves, and he has chosen to live the life of an assassin to serve his country. Nothing comes before duty for this 007. Unlike many of the out of shape, or average physique Bonds of the past, Craig's Bond looks and captures the physicality of a man that can kill with his bare hands. The movie's opening let's you know that this 007 is ice cold, as he becomes a 007. The pacing is perfect, the best poker game in cinema history, and a love story that will engross and capture the audiences emotion. Action set pieces are among the best (and are the best imo). If there is such a thing as the perfect Bond film, this is it. And no one does it better (past, present or future) than the incomparable Daniel Craig.",positive
"For being a new start for this generation, gets all the parameters of a great action film, when you feel that it's getting common, has a great plot twist which gift more development to James Bond and getting so enveloping and interesting.",positive
Fun movie and I loved the character of Vesper but has an underwhelming ending and overall it didn't blow me away like I wanted it to. But it was solid.,negative
"[⭐️90%] Casino Royale (2006) takes a franchise which was running on fumes and breathes new life into it thanks to lead Daniel Craig as well as a more serious tone, whilst still maintaining all the necessary details to associate it with previous James Bond entries. Mads Mikkelsen makes for a fantastic villain to introduce to this revived franchise, seriously setting big ambitions. While it may not be the first film to come to mind when somebody mentions James Bond due to its freshness away from the campiness of the classics, it certainly is one of the best constructed spy movies to date.",positive
"Contains by far the second sexiest flirt scene on a train (here's looking at you, Eve Kendall). Contains by far the best cock and ball torture scene in cinematic history. One sympathizes. Contains by far the best parkour chase this side of Jason Bourne. Contains by far the best poker tournament outside of that portrait with the 'eccin dogs. Bond Begins is a blast.",positive
5.0/5.0 A Masterpiece,positive
Very refreshing to watch given some of the silly Bond movies that came before. The action is amazing and Daniel Craig as James Bond is a gift.,positive
"Bond, but not as we know him. Not a bad start for the new phase.",negative
"The 'Blonde Bond' proves the world wrong in his first outing: top-notch action, a more-than-memorable villain and a glorious Bond girl. What a great reinvention of the franchise that seemed dead and buried just four years earlier.",positive
My favorite Bond movie with my favorite actor as James Bond!,positive
Great movie. One of the best in the series after the absurdities of Die Another Day.,positive
Movie holds up and a great way to begin DC Bond portrayal,positive
"Bond has always been—and very much remains, fanboi protestations aside—a descriptive cipher of masculinity; and whereas so many of the earlier entries unwittingly but authentically lampoon the overblown absurdity inherent to a particular kind of manliness, what I personally find disengaging about the Craig films is how seriously (and thus falsely) they treat masculinity. In a post-9/11 era, when imperial might has been politically castrated, when the seeming seamlessness of technological advancement gives the lie of a smooth realism, Bond in turn must be castrated at every turn. Don't mistake me: I don't mean to long nostalgically for some mythical manliness, only that the earnest grit and saturation of this version is just as structurally masculine without any subversive or performative winks, a turn that is more prescriptive and authoritarian (just like the rest of the contemporary West).",positive
"My favorite of the Daniel Craig Movies.. It's got action, it's very emotional and it sets the bar high for the 007 Movies that follow it. Highly recommend it.",positive
real good movie i did like it from start to finish,positive
"With this being a sort of reboot to the james bond franchise. Giving it more of a serious tone than the previous instalments. Casino Royal is definitely one of the better Bond films in the franchise. Daniel Craigs performance as the double-o spy is great and gives Bond his same charm but as well clever traits, as well as emotion. The stunts and action scenes are great, and every threat to bonds life keeps you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend giving this one a watch, especially those who were more of fans of Connery's work.",positive
"Rating: A- ""Casino Royale is a near-perfect debut of Daniel Craig as the new James Bond. This brutal version of the famous protagonist is beautifully interpreted by Craig, who contradicted the naysayers at the time of release and delivers a phenomenal performance as the iconic 007. His witty humor, irresistible charm, and excellent line deliveries find a close match in Eva Green's take of the ""Bond girl"", whose intelligence and strong attitude puts aside any generic, formulaic traits. Mads Mikkelsen is outstanding as always as the vulnerable antagonist, but his impact on the overall picture is slightly underwhelming. The action set pieces are worthy of belonging to blockbusters of today, holding impressive stunt work and cinematography. Martin Campbell creates one of those films I can't pinpoint any flaws. Bond fans will feel delighted.""",positive
"Casino Royale is such a big disappointment when it comes to an extensive action flick as the film loses itself in various aspects of the film. The major problem with this movie is that the PG-13 rating is holding it back. Several components needed the R rating so it would feel more fleshed out. One of those features being the story. While the story isn't entirely in disharmony, it is not sufficient for a movie that runs over the 120-minute mark. The simplistic plot drags on for too long with so many sluggish scenes. For instance, the poker scene goes on way longer than it should have. The filmmakers knew this, as the awkwardly positioned heart attack scene diminishes the sequence as a whole. Furthermore, the tone of the movie is just off in general. The film tries to be this edgy spy thriller but never gets close to it with this PG-13 rating. The identity of this film is similarly off as it does not feel like a spy movie. The basic plot is moderately decent, but it doesn't warrant an approximately 150-minute runtime. There are numerous scenes in the film where it feels like Martin Campbell is trying to make a narrative that James Bond is this top-notch agent who has the cockiness that everyone loves. Yet, it is never thoroughly achieved in Campbell's vision. The closest the film ever gets to feeling like a spy movie is the opening scene. It is simplistic yet has this sophistication with the black and white filter and that gruesome fight. From that point on, the film loses the spy aspect throughout the rest of the movie. The saving grace of Casino Royale is the cast. Daniel Craig does a substantial job at portraying James Bond, and it feels like he is putting his own essence into the role, so Craig is not playing a typical spy. While Vesper's story was poor, Eva Green does a solid job in the film. Mads Mikkelsen is the most ineffective in the cast as he does very little trying to stand out in the ensemble. His character arc is not well-constructed, and Mikkelsen does not fix it with his performance. As for Jeffrey Wright and Judi Dench, they were excellent in this film. Both added some much-needed variety to the action flick. Before wrapping it up, the last feature of the film that was deeply hard to look at was the visual effects. The visual effects were not the best as some scenes contained visual effects that would be inadequate for anyone watching the movie. Yes, the movie came out in 2006. However, plenty of films had excellent visual effects and CGI that had releases dates before this movie. Casino Royale is a consequential, jumbled mess that runs on for too long as it tries to make a simple story complex. With the R rating holding the film back, Martin Campbell's vision never reaches its ample capacity. The acting is the only feature saving this movie from the tedious mess that it is. A supposed energetic action-thriller is actually an undeveloped snoozefest. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com",negative
"One of my favorites, rough and unrefined",positive
Absolutely fantastic movie. A standard for how to make awesome engaging Spy/action thrillers,positive
"Casino Royale was the return of James Bond after several years since the last one and brought Daniel Craig as the James Bond of the 21st century at least the early part. James Bond is easily one of the most iconic characters in movie history and the longest running franchise of a British spy working for MI6 who faces numerous dangerous villains around the world. Daniel Craig is James Bond in this one and he is incredible bringing the bravado, machismo, suave looks and his appetite for women that we know from Bond. Alongside him is veteran British actress Dame Judy Dench who returns as M from the pierce brosnan franchise. Mrs Dench is exquisite as a no nonsense lady who cares about Bond and sees him as her best agent but is constantly frustrated by his arrogance and theatrics. Mads Milkensen as the villain is good here but quite underwhelmed for a bond villain yet the torture scene with Craig truly brings the sadism that Milkensen brings to his villainous roles. The script is well written and weaves a story of intrigue, trilling action, government spying and crime fighting and sexy moments that make this film a sophisticated action film of a kind that we no longer see from Hollywood sadly and began Craig's journey as James Bond.",positive
The best in bond series. Good that they brought Martin Campbell back. Probably the best bond after Connery.,positive
one of the best Bond movies,positive
Absolutely pure excitement film.,positive
it was a very good movie,positive
My favourite of the Bond movies.,positive
Too much plot armor and casual unpunished murder.,negative
"As it comes to mind where the narrative continuations for multiple movies at risk of downscaling were confidently inspired as aspirations were triggered by James Bond's nonsensical canonship, including this genuinely apparent restart that formally introduces the double-o agent to a younger, thrill-seeking generation. This isn't your ordinary action flick you come to expect as it's pretty much the definitive spy film having a classier benchmark in the genre with action-packed spectacle being recognizably thrilling in addition to captivating confrontations when under the radar. Intellectually directed and written to boost start the supposably early flare seemingly embodied by Craig's suitable performance of building up Bond's experience that brightened his stardom, but the film seems to be better enjoyed by those who were repeatedly captivated after each film of the long-running franchise of cinematic maintenance based on literature. Engaging entertainment though with thrilling action pieces and intelligence, just not enough to persuade to go back and forward. (B+)",positive
My favorite movie of all time,positive
"Austin Powers destroyed the old James Bond franchise by taking most of the elements of the classic James Bond films and amplifying them just enough to make them absolutely hilarious. In order to set itself apart from that era, Casino Royal marks a significant departure from the traditional approach to a Bond film, reinventing Bond in a way that is much closer to the character described by Ian Fleming in his original books. Daniel Craig drew significant criticism when it was announced he would replace Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, but from the opening scenes of Casino Royale it becomes clear why he was the right choice. Craig's Bond is gritty, tough and brutal - the sort of characteristics you might expect from an authorised killer. Gone are the pithy one-liners and silly gadgets. This Bond gets his hands dirty with much more violent hand-to-hand combat than his predecessors. The choice of black and white for the opening sequence is clever: it is a nod to the classic spy films of the 1960s, like The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, as well as to underscore to the viewer that this will be a very different Bond film. Martin Campbell's direction is more cinematic than the previous Bond films, with lots of sweeping camera moves and pacy editing that fits the action. Eva Green is excellent as the smart, self-assured British treasury employee Vespa Lynd, another departure from Bond traditions in terms of the stereotypical Bond girl. Casino Royale is so different that is easy to forget this is a Bond film, but Judi Dench plays a crucial role in grounding the film within the Bond franchise, returning as the smart, authoritative MI6 chief ""M"". The storyline is initially hard to follow, particularly in the first act, but becomes clear as the film progresses. There are some great action sequences and enough intrigue to keep your attention right until the end of the film.",positive
12.08.2021 ---------,negative
Pretty good action and suspense. Better than earlier Bond movies as some of the sexist attitude is gone.,negative
It's hard to find fault with Daniel Craig's 1st outing as Bond....brilliant stunts a great villain and a great story,positive
Daniel Craig gives us the old school grit that Sean Connery did in the late 60's. Bond is back and he's a lot more violent too.,positive
This is the Bond film I always wanted.,positive
"I just adore Casino Royale. Daniel Craig is absolutely excellent as Bond and can deliver so much emotion especially during the torture scene and I love his chemistry with Eva Green's Vesper. Their romance is overall really well developed and I enjoy their interactions especially the train scene where they learn about each other and this movie has amazing stunt work and action scenes: the opening chase, the airport fight, the stairway fight and the final fight scene and the CGI when used is incredible and I love the dark and gritty tone of the movie, it made me feel really invested in this dark and serious story and it's balanced well with the lighter elements. The movie is a bit too long though. The poker scene drag on a lot and as someone who doesn't understand poker, it made it even worse and it just felt weird to progress from Bond being tortured to Bond and Vesper making out a lot. They definitely could've handled the tone better in the third act. Plus, it's just another movie about terrorists wanting to bomb things but regardless it's well acted, well directed with an intense story and great action (A)",positive
"More of a reinvention than an individual pillar of achievement. The romance is given too much in proportion to other events, but still a nice diversion.",negative
"A well done, much darker take on the infamous character that takes away all the silliness of the previous films and adds more complexity and depth to the story",positive
"It is a good James Bond movie. Good action scenes, plot and everything but it doesn't innovate. It wins with the suspense and the energy that it gives to the viewer. A great entertainment, but it not a great film. Just good.",negative
"Really brilliant movie. Action packed, dramatic, emotional. A bit too much romance but that's just my weird dislike of film romance, not in any way a fault of the movie.",positive
Very much one of the better Bond movies. The showing of blood makes it much better than most other Bond movies anyway. Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond. Eva Green was a good choice for the love interest and they have great chemistry together.,positive
Daniel Craig fully satisfies as an extremely dominant seductive middle-aged James Bond that doesn't even the distract its divisive rich setting,positive
"The first movie in the Daniel Craig series: Casino Royale. This movie is incredible, from start to finish. Daniel Craig gives an amazing performance and it really has you on the edge of your seat during the poker games. Overall it gets a 4.5/5 from me",positive
"Good opening, good scenes (especially the ones in the casino), good ending.",positive
"One of, if not my favourite Bond film. This film was a massive breath of fresh air for a franchise that was getting extremely tired and was devolving into self-parody. From the overly campy and over-the-top nonsense that was Die Another Day (2002), a serious reboot was needed. In Casino Royale we were provided the perfect antidote to the stale silliness we had been served up for years on end. We get a much darker and grittier incarnation of 007 here that is much closer in keeping with the original source material. In the spirit of a great reboot and reset of the series, everything is stripped back to the bone here. Bond is on his first assignment as a 00, there's no fancy gadgets, and the violence is visceral and up close as opposed to detached and almost meaningless in earlier films. Bond is also more emotionally vulnerable here, we see some of that remaining humanity he has inside before it is all stripped away by the end of the film. We see the formation of a cold and ruthless instrument of the government right before our eyes. Chris Cornell's 'You Know My Name' has to be one of the strongest Bond themes and I love how musical motifs from the main song are used throughout the film. My only problem with this film is that it's slightly too long, with the last part of the film feeling separate from the rest. It certainly lulls toward the end which is a shame.",positive
I still enjoyed this amazing James Bond 007 classic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"Remarkably average. The dialogue is pretty bad at a lot of points in my opinion, maybe it's just the writers trying to stick closer to the bond likeness but it just comes off as choppy and not realistic to the way anyone talks. There are points in the poker scenes where the dialogue is just them explaining how poker works and what the current bet is. I have no issue with the quippy remarks that aren't necessarily realistic, that's just part of the bond charm. I take issue with normal conversations being awful for the sake of trying to pay homage to the originals. With that being said the action scenes and the story are what shine here. They do a great job of telling a bond story with twists and turns while keeping it interesting. The cinematography is decent and the score is great. If you like bond films you'll like this otherwise it's just an okay movie.",negative
"My brother loves watching every single 007 movie since he has little. I have been along for the ride ever since. One thing about this movie, CASINO ROYALE, is that it shows James Bond not only in his prime, but as a person that is willing to get the job done.",positive
"With mind-blowing action, subtle intelligence, and just enough characterization, Daniel Craig's revision of the suave British spy is part of the bigger mix of more serious and bolder Bond filmmaking, though I couldn't help but notice that some silly logic seeps through anyway.",positive
"""Casino Royale"" is undeniably the best Bond film to date. Martin Campbell made a gorgeous looking film with fantastic scenes filled with action, suspense, and mystery. Daniel Craig is prefect for the role of 007 and honestly, how many movies can make a card game interesting?",positive
"What do you do when you have a successful film franchise that is teetering with its fans? Reboot. For the first time a new Bond comes with a complete overhaul of the series and we are reintroduced to James Bond all over again. At first I questioned why the producers went so far away from the typical elements Bond films usually had but today I call it one of the most successful gambles in Hollywood history. Daniel Craig is a grittier and physical Bond than we have ever seen and his approach works for today's action lover. While they didn't throw away every aspect we find in a Bond film, it certainly feels like a brand new series with Craig's introduction. Villain A- / Bond Girl A- / Theme B",positive
My fav yet. Chemistry between Bond & Vesper is amazing.,positive
Why is he so serious all the time? Is he a robot? Is he the terminator? Why does he always look so bored?,negative
"Everything about this movies was great, except for a few of the fight scene. Typical Hollywood shaky cam shots when there is action. It’s always hard to understand was going on when that happens.",positive
A fun James Bond action movie,positive
"I have seen every Bond Film to date.  For me I feel there are two genuine candidates for the type of Bond that is grounded a little more in reality, and, compelling to watch from beginning to end. That honour goes to Timothy Dalton and Daniel Craig. Sean Connery was exceptional in the role from the early 1960's but these films are very much of their time.  ""Casino Royal"" takes the Bond premise and redefines the character. Like Timothy Dalton's more dark edgy Bond, Daniel Craig also removes the silliness of the previous few films and relies on the man to the job rather than ridiculous gadgetry. I much prefer the darker, grounded element both these actors brought to the role of James Bond.  ""Casino Royal"" takes us on a character building journey. How Bond becomes the agent he  aspires to be. The mistakes made , the lessons learnt and the emotions felt are all explored in this brilliant story. It also has one of the best villains in Le Chiffre (  Mads Mikkelsen ) and Daniel Craig is magnificent in his first outing as Bond.  The title song ""You know my name"" performed by Chris Cornell sets the mood and tone of the film as a gritty , dark  cinematic experience to come. This shows the thought process and detail the filmmakers went into when redefining the franchise.   Overall ""Casino Royal"" is the place to start for newcomers to the world of James Bond  without having to look back. The 1970's and 1990's were not the best time periods for the franchise as the agent seemed to enter a world of slapstick and almost superhero gadgetry. The gritty, dark, more grounded  Bond, played by Timothy Dalton in the 1980's, was undermined somewhat by his successor in the role,  particularly in the last two of the Pierce Brosnan films.  Therefore in conclusion, ""Casino Royal"" is a far superior James Bond film than anything previous and sets the bar very high for further entries into the franchise.",positive
"The filmmakers offer us a masterclass in action scenes in this well crafted reinvention of the unstoppable force that is 007. With a great cast to back him up, the series has probably never felt so real, but still keeping the intensity and heart of what the franchise is about.",positive
Daniel Craig brings a darker and more grittier Bond film with great performances and thrilling action. This is a premier action film that is one of the series' best.,positive
One of the best movies of all time. Has everything,positive
He's definitely my favorite bond!,positive
"The best Bond film to date, featuring a brilliant performance from Daniel Craig, blistering edge-of-the-seat action, a classic Bond score, and a new story that gives Bond fans a breath of fresh air.",positive
"This movie kicked so much arse right from the beginning. Absolutely among the best Bond films ever, smart, funny, sick action, great banter and DC is the GOAT Bond.",positive
Film molto bello però perde per la parte finale troppo allungata,negative
I love the bond films but cant get with the blue eye blond bond,negative
"Only Skyfall does this good in Craig's career as Bond. Craig comes out swinging and knocks the role right out of the park! Great opening theme, great villain, high stakes, directional drama, and genius directing and action!",positive
What an amazing way to introduce Daniel Craig as the New James Bond. Really does transcend the franchise to much bigger and better heights.,positive
Just about as close to a perfect modern Bond film as you can get.,positive
"James Bond is Daniel Craig, and he shows us that in this great storyline fit for a Bond film.",positive
Amazing James Bond movie even though it is Craig's first time as Bond.,positive
"Action, great. Story, great. Daniel Craig, great. Movie, amazing! Loved everything about this movie.",positive
"After the dumpster fire that was 2002's Die Another Day, Casino Royale is beyond a breath of fresh air. Daniel Craig reinvents the character, bringing and building upon a vulnerability to Bond not seen since Lazenby. The film is the antithesis of its predecessor, clicking from beginning to end (the theme for Casino Royale, the late Chris Cornell's ""You Know My Name,"" is arguably the single greatest Bond theme of all time). We see here quite literally a new Bond, as the film reboots the franchise, and shows a more rough around the edges 007, who has only recently received his 00 status. We also see a Bond who has difficulty keeping his emotions in check, developing genuine feelings for the women he becomes involved with on the job, particularly the beautiful and tragic Vesper Lynd. Action-packed, dramatic, and high-stakes, Daniel Craig's first foray as Bond returns the series to a glory not seen since Connery's heyday.",positive
Daniel Craig stars in the rebooted James Bond series as a more mature and grittier main character. With feelings that sparked emotion and action with tense pay-off. Something critics and audiences can find enjoyment even if not familiar with the lore.,positive
Absolutely incredible movie (don't gamble kids),positive
A fantastic movie that is filled with action. Daniel Craig is brilliant In his first outing as bond.This movie is not just a great James Bond film but a great movie in general. Although the film can feel long at some points and the CJI and green screens do not hold up that good.,positive
Daniel Craig breathes new life into James Bond and gives the character a whole new layer of depth and authenticity that we’ve never seen before. Very impressive performance and storyline. One of the standouts of the franchise.,positive
"An edgy, more believable and intense Bond, just what the doctor ordered.",positive
This is a Bond film where each kill has weight.,positive
Great movie to start off the Bond series,positive
smelly fish is the word for this movie,positive
"""Royal flush wins"" ... man when I first saw that poker scene, it was dumbfounding. The build up to it, the scenery, the colors ... it was very sweet. Daniel Craig's first attempt at 007 is captured quite well and he shows us both the hardcore and the soft side of being one of the most dangerous agents on the planet.",positive
One of the best movies of the 007 franchise. Impeccable performances and incredible action scenes are present in this movie.I highly recommend.,positive
"La pelicula Abarca una trama apasionante, de la accion al drama al romance, es la mejor pelicula del ultimo 007 impresionante",positive
Best Bond movie. Change my mind,positive
"I really like this movie! Daniel Craig is definitely a more grounded and realistic Bond, which is exactly what makes this movie so entertaining. Eva Green has amazing chemistry with the leading man and Mads Mikkelsen is a pretty good villain. The action sequences are spectacular and some of the technical achievements are quite remarkable. This movie may not be Oscar-worthy, but its gritty take on the iconic character is enough to keep viewers engrossed and amazed.",positive
"Personally my favourite of the entire series, bringing Bond back to his routes, ditching the over the top gadgetry. Emotional exciting storytelling, Le Chiffre a fantastic villain, the gambling scenes are truly suspenseful, the action realistic and perilous. Eva Green is easily up there with Diana Rigg, tied for the most three dimensional Bond girl whose character you grow to care for.",positive
"Nothing new, just removed superhero tag from James Bond while still maintaining some of his charisma, though direction is superb, content is rich and infallibility of main character lesser.",positive
"So fantastic, and it sets the tone for the Craig Bond films.",positive
"I may have been a little too harsh on Casino Royale when it first came out. Watching it over a decade later, this movie holds up better than many previous James Bond installments. The story is solid, the action is thrilling, and even though it's grounded in realism, it has just enough playfulness to feel like a Bond film. Daniel Craig may not be my favorite 007, but the movie surrounding him is very well done.",positive
"I may be very late to this party, and this is the first Bond film I've ever seen so I have no point of reference, howe we, this is a fantastic action film. The story is smart and remains interesting from start to finish, never making it clear what will happen next. It works very well as an origin story for James Bond that has him making mistakes and being too quick to make rash decisions. All of which makes for a much better and more fascinating observation of his character. Daniel Craig is amazing as he's been in just about every movie I've seen him in. He plays the stone cold killer side of Bond as well as the human side very well, showing no matter what he does he is still just a man. The love story isn't forced and really has a place in the story without overwhelming it. The action is just great, and not overused so to take over the movie but instead spread out to make the dramatic scenes more impactful and make for a complete narrative. All this to say, I loved it. One of the best modern action films hands down.",positive
"The names Craig....Daniel Craig. Craig IS 007!! Super charged testosterone popcorn movie with a great love story at its core. Craig and Mikkelsen together is a great combo, love Judi Dench as M.",negative
The best action movie ever for me,positive
Casino Royale is a astounding new way of James Bond where they tried to reboot and take a new approach to the James Bond series for a better and more straight storyline and they succeded. It starts with a rather unconventional first scene in black and white where he is getting his double 0 status. It manages it to give the viewer the progress of himself within the action scenes as he tries to become a better agent. The only problem I face are problems with the music as it is sometimes too silent.,positive
By far the best Bond movie and one of the best action movies of all time.,positive
"La película llega a ser algo cursi y con un realismo... ""dudoso"", pero la ambientación, los personajes, y todo el tema del casino la hacen una buena película, ademas tiene un gran opening",positive
Oh boy. You'd better believe I watched Casino Royale again. This movie is only my favorite Bond film of the Franchise. I will re-watch this film over and over again. I've seen so many videos analyzing it and each one just makes me want to watch this film again. It's so good. Highly enjoy it and I will watch it again.,positive
great suspenseful and action packed bond.,positive
The best Bond film since Goldfinger!,positive
Mads is excellent. Solid action flick.,negative
"Stylish, intense, and exciting; Casino Royale reinvents Bond for the 21st century. Daniel Craig is, in my opinion, the best Bond to date. Transcending the typical ""Bond girl"" mold, Eva Green helps make Vesper Lind a complex, interesting, and equally impressive supporting character to Craig's Bond.",positive
"Jeff Barnes 6/18/15 Casino Royale Review Casino Royale is the 21st Bond film in the Bond franchise and the first starring Daniel Craig as James Bond and it turns out to be the best Bond film since Goldfinger with the best actor since Sean Connery playing James Bond. James Bond is put on a mission by his boss M, to stop a mad terrorist from using money for very suspicious matters by beating him in a game of poker. The film starts out in a very suspicious way, as it should with the fact that it is a spy picture. Precisely apprehensive music plays at the beginning of the picture. A man by the name of Dryden goes up an elevator and he himself looks apprehensive as he goes up the elevator. He looks as if he almost knows that Bond is going to kill him because he has betrayed Bond, and he also looks authentically frightened as well. We are told what kind of film it is at the beginning not just by what kind of music plays but also with what happens at the beginning. The traditional gun barrel sequence and montage that is presents in all Bond flicks is done during the introduction. A more modern and creative technique is done for the gun barrel sequence. The montage is done in a precisely unique way by mixing animation in with action or choreography and playing a genuinely upbeat melody. Casino Royale aside from being an authentically suspenseful film has great action and choreography, which make it a solid action film. An example would be a scene in which James Bond is chasing after a terrorist by the name of Mollaka, and they end up fighting on a crane that's moving, and there is beautiful cinematography with the camera moving around the crane showing them fighting. Mollaka and Bond jump from one crane to the next as well in this exhibition. Another example of action in the motion picture is when Bond is chasing after another terrorist named Carlos and he's holding on to the top of a truck as he drives it. They also end up fighting in the truck, which is an example of more choreography and there's also an explosion. The picture isn't just known for it's action, suspense, cinematography, and it's notion that it always advices you to pay attention not just with it being a spy film but with the notion that it keeps you males in particular paying attention with the many pretty ladies that are displayed, in it even the one's that have minor roles such as one that has a role of a receptionist and this sort of thing is in other Bond films as well but also for its solid acting. There is plenty going on with Daniel Craig's face when he plays Mr. Bond. When Craig gets in a serious fight with a man at the beginning of the film and he knocks him out he breaths really hard thought his nose, and he looks at him like he's above him and he pities him and he's disgusted with him because of what he's done. Near the end of the film when a lady that he gets romantically involved with named Vesper Lynd is getting tortured his eyes looks like they have plenty of fear in them, and he's breathing authentically hard and sweating a whole bunch too as if his heart is beating really fast even as fast as it has ever beaten and we wonder if he's going to have a heart attack at this moment in the film. When Mads Mikkelsen who plays Le Chiffre the antagonist in the film is yelling he yells in a tone in which is a normal tone in which someone would yell in during this exhibition, and he sweats and sounds as if he's very insecure of himself during this scene as he's supposed to due to what Bond says. Jeffrey Wright plays Felix Leiter in an inducible stable way particularly during the poker scene in the film when he looks at Le Chiffre in an extremely mean way after he's found out what he's done to Bond, and the way he looks at him also looks very tough as if he could even take him out himself. Eva Green also gives a fine performance as Bond's love interest Vesper Lynd. When James Bond talks to her she looks right in his eye's as if she knows she can trust him equally during a scene in which he doesn't believe she can trust him. I give Casino Royale a 10 out of 10 considering that it's not just know for it's well done action scenes and suspense as plenty of Bond films are but also largely due to its acting and that it's the best Bond film since Goldfinger with the best Bond actor since Connery.",positive

"Haunting, violent and emotionally devastating. True James bond lead by the best bond to ever grace our eyes. Motherfucking Daniel Craig. OH and the villain is actually a human and has realistic motives!",positive
Daniel Craig is amazing - best Bond movie yet,positive
This could be one of the top 10 worst movies ever simply because expectations for a bond movie are high and this steaming pile of dog poo on the sidewalk is a misguided bore-fest.,negative

"When Pierce Brosnan wanted $30M to do another Bond film, the producers decided it was time to find someone else. Hiring Daniel Craig (who wasn't even born when the franchise began) gave them a chance to reinvigorate the flagging series. Here we see 'Bond… James Bond' just beginning his career as 007 for the first time on film. This the twenty-second Bond film and this one may also be the best: it manages to keep the humor but not be hokey, have terrific set pieces, a femme fatale and a dastardly villain, and updates the first Ian Fleming Bond novel while staying the most faithful to it of the three versions filmed. Daniel Craig comes off as a bit of an anti-hero and can smirk with the best of them. And there are more than a few references to Bond history, including Bond coming out of the ocean in a speedo that harkens back to Ursula Andress' entrance in ""Dr. No."" It is quite the thrilling ride.",positive
"Before this movie, there were only two answers to the question ""who is your favorite James Bond?"" Daniel Craig makes damn sure that this will not be a two-party race by throwing his hat in the ring. For style and class, Craig gives the other Bonds a run for their money. For intensity, there's no comparison.",positive
Daniel Craig's first film as James Bond. Certainly puts James Bond in a new light,positive
"Not sure what others saw in this film, but I found it tedious. The initial parkour scene was riveting for about 2 minutes, then became too lengthy. And that is a theme which seems to dominate the film. Scenes were too long. The poker scene(s) seemed endless and effectively meaningless as it ended precisely as one would expect. The only redeeming factor apart from the excellent action scenes was Eva Green, who was gorgeous. And, the final nail in the coffin is the fact that, like the sequel to ""The Matrix"", this movie ""surprises"" you by having no ending and being the first in a two-part series. That infuriates me.",negative
"Weirdly enough, even though it broke away from most of the conventions of the film series, it felt like a perfect Bond movie.",positive
"One of the best Bond films. A strong intro to the character, intense story, and great characters.",positive
"As a Bond-head, this is 5 bags, some betrayal, some testicular torture, and a license to kill. It feels fresh and rejuvenated but like classic Bond at the same time. Mads Mikkelsen and Eva Green are also awesome supporting players here. It's one of this franchise's top 5!!!!",positive
"Casino Royale has action scenes crafted from excellent stunt work, cool gambling scenes, some nice romance scenes and a heartbreaking ending",positive
"This might be my favorite Daniel Craig Bond movie. It is either this one or skyfall. But Casino Royale is smart, sophisticated, interesting, intense. I thought Mads Mikkelsen is really good as the Bond villain. The ruthlessness of Daniel Craig's Bond in this movie is a little shocking to me. I didn't think Bond could be brutal with the way he killed people but this is a really good movie",positive
One of the best Bond movies and glad to see the silly gadgets put away. This is a great thriller action movie and a must see.,positive
"Definitely my favorite Bond film along with Skyfall. Focusing on a younger, more inexperienced, and imperfect Bond, it's an interesting and very fresh take on the character!",positive
I never thought a Bond movie could top Goldfinger. I was wrong. Craig gives an absolutely great performance as Bond in a shift from the tradtional character. Def the best Bond movie ever made in my opinion.,positive
Daniel Craig leads off his Bond debut with a homerun. Great Bond installment with a love twist.,negative
"The desperate revision this franchise needed has become successful as Casino Royal has everything we would want in a focused James Bond movie. With great performances by Craig alongside Eva, this is a Bond movie you cannot miss. Mads Mikkelsen shines yet again as well with his role as Le Chiffre.",positive
This movie is awesome with great action but the ending gose to long after the climax is done and when everything is wrapped up but still great.,positive
"Terrific intro for Daniel Craig as James Bond, and probably my favorite Bond movie.",positive
"I went into this being my first Bond movie, and I can confidently say I loved it. When watching, I kept thinking ""This is the end right?"" But no, It goes from storyline to storyline while keeping you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next.",positive
"Martin Campbell manages to make Bond a dark killer, a romantic man, and an overall amazing agent all at the same time, ditching the original Bond roots. The Bond girl, isn't as you expect it to be, it's actually a very important part in the story rather than just have sex with Bond. One of my favorites of the franchise.",positive
"I absolutely love this movie and this is a very good movie. This honestly might be my favorite movie of all time but I think I will have to watch it again. This is my favorite Bond and all of the other ones have a formula to them and this one breaks the Bond mold and formula and cliches of the previous movies for good and this is a Bond that is more human and grounded. This movie really changed Bond like Batman Begins changed Batman to be more realistic and Casino Royale changed Bond to be more realistic and human and relatable. This movie has some of my favorite one-liners in all of cinema. This movie also has my favorite frame in all of film with Daniel Craig holding a phone and a rifle at the end of the movie it looks so epic. The acting in this movie is very good and I think that Daniel Craig is the best actor that has played Bond and he gives the best performance of all of the other Bonds that have played before him. The chase/action sequences in this movie are my favorite. The beginning chase sequence is my favorite chase in all of cinema and Daniel Craig is chasing Sebastien Foucan the founder of free running. They also never use CGI it is all practical effects which is very impressive, in one scene where a car flips, it flips seven times setting the world record for most car flips in any movie. The cinematography is the best in the Bond franchise the way they use the lighting in one sequence is outstanding and the color grading and film grain look fabulous. The script and dialogue is amazing and like I said before the one-liners are amazing. This movie has my favorite score in cinema when Daniel Craig says the iconic line ""The names Bond, James Bond"" the iconic score kicks in and it makes that amazing scene so much better. His arc in this movie and in the next movies is one of my favorite arcs in film and we see the beginnings and the ends of 007. The way they create tension in this movie works so well even in the poker game they create tension and it works so well. The story had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish and it is so engaging and gripping and it is just so entertaining. Overall it is my absolute favorite movie and I would recommend it to anyone especially if you love James Bond. 1000%🙌🎂",positive
"Back when I just in Middle School watching this movie purely for its action, I still find it really riveting. Watching it again and again in the span of a decade I still can find amazing things every time I hit the play button. I grew up with Brosnan's Bond but after seeing this movie without a doubt Daniel Craig is absolutely the best version of 007 so far, I love Craig portrayal in this movie and he always gives an amazing performance in every scene he's in, combine it with the Villain, Bond Girl and other characters in this instalment that are just as amazing as another aspect around it. The camera work and the stunt is one of the best things I've ever seen in an action movie, not to forget the cool animation played with the soundtrack in the opening of this movie performed by late Chris Cornell. The story is also one of the best and darkest in the franchise which giving an epic journey with some heartbroken turn, even the ending in this movie is still giving me chills down to my spine until now. Truly a masterpiece that set a new standard for James Bond movie while revolutionizing it at the same time.",positive
"This 21st Bond movie was very good. Daniel Craig was a real badass as James Bond. In fact, he's the best of all the Bond actors. The rest of the cast did a spectacular job in this movie as well. The plot to the movie was very thrilling and some unexpected moments occurred that will blow the viewers' minds. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's a definite must see.",positive
the best of daniel craig,negative
"This is a cracker. It is easy to see that 'Casino Royale' is a reboot of the series, as it feels fresher whilst still keeping the charm of 007. It isn't quite my favourite Bond, 'The Man with the Golden Gun' and 'From Russia with Love' (currently) surpass it, but Daniel Craig's debut is one to be proud of. He is excellent in the role. Mads Mikkelsen makes for a grand villain, certainly one to be remembered. Eva Green brings a good dynamic to Bond's female lead, while it was pleasing to see Jeffrey Wright; I always enjoy watching him. The plot is entertaining, I was thoroughly locked in during the poker scenes in particular. With that noted, the ending to this film is what marks it down for me. It concludes the main premise nicely, but the other parts felt like an add-on - which are finished a bit too sharpish. That is my only negative, as the rest is very good. I also appreciate how worldwide it all feels too... Bond is at its best when it shows off the world.",negative
"I gave it an hour, it's just not my thing...",negative
"Bond's triumphant comeback! Well worth the hiatus after the embarrassing DAD, this movie takes us into a brand new continuity regarding Bond's first outing as Bond. This movie takes Bond from being superman to being much more human and 3 dimensional. Excellently shot, great stunts mostly performed by Craig, Judi Dench really amps up her performance as M and her character is actually factored well into the plot rather than just there for exposition, i can go on. If you haven't seen this excellent part of Bond movie history then you're truly missing out. Watch it today!",positive
"""Now the whole world's gonna know that you died scratching my balls!"" 🪑 Bond is brash, blonde, & BACK! Stripping down to its bare essentials brought this series into the 21st century, where a cocktail recipe of amazing performances, solid writing, expert editing & skilled direction make this a must-see for any action film fan. ""I cannot wait to watch the sequel!"" 9/10 lashes to the balls.",positive
"A breath of fresh life into the James Bond series. Casino Royale restarts the franchise with a more realistic, brutal take on Bond. The film strips away the excessive gadgetry and CGI that was a trend in previous titles. Thank god. This new direction helped set the tone for Daniel Craig 007 movies to come. The action sequences action-packed and satisfying. Though, the main villain(s) were a bit underdeveloped and the movie left us at a cliff-hanger. Some died a bit too fast, IMO. Some things still did break my suspension of reality. Why is such a high-stakes poker game have such lax security? Vesper can walk up to Bond while he's playing. Bond can walk away from the game uninterrupted for hours. People are found murdered and kidnapped but security/police is not alerted despite the clientele at the game. But besides that, I'm glad the film does great justice to its source material. 4/5. One star off for some laziness in writing, still a great film.",positive
9.0/10 .,positive
"My first Bond viewing is a success. Craig is awesome, as are Green and Mikkelsen. The movie starts hot, has a phenomenal card game scene, features more emotion than expected, and has tremendous action. I just wish the final act is better as it lost my interest by then.",positive
One the best James Bond movies!,positive
I really enjoyed myself with the twist and turns and overall style. I can never get enough of the bond tropes. Classic Bond.,positive
"The best, if not one of the best spy movies I've seen. I've only seen Live and Let Die and Goldfinger, but this movie is on another league. Daniel Craig is the best bond out there.",positive

"The biggest takeaway from Casino Royale is that it shows what happens when you bring brave ideas to an old and stale property. If this is the mould for future Bond films, hopefully all of them starring the tailor-made Daniel Craig, then we're in for a real treat and a much-needed revamp of Britain's greatest spy.

"With outstanding performances by Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen and Judi Dench, a great direction by Martin Campbell, an excellent script by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, a memorable soundtrack by David Arnold, a beautiful cinematography by Phil Meheux and electrifying action scenes, Casino Royale manages to reinvent this franchise and gives James Bond a new face",positive
Very good introduction to Daniel Craigs bond role. Action packed and gripping.,positive
"Gripping and exciting. Maybe the greatest Bond film to ever grace the silver screen, but maybe one of the best action thriller movies of all time. Brilliant film that will stand the test of time.",positive
Daniel Craig's first outing as 007 is brilliant as it makes a game of poker interesting and suspenseful. It turns James Bond into a grittier character which is a welcome change and the movie allows for some excellent action scenes. The movie gives James Bond more of a sense of humanity with his girlfriend but an issue I have is that the government's plan is extremely flawed and makes them appear stupid rather than being a secret service.,positive
An exciting and emotional adventure that introduces us to the new era of James Bond.,positive
"Daniel Craig's first outing as Bond is a great remaster of ""Casino Royale"" with wonderful performances making a great villain and Bond girl and thrilling sequences, 10/10.",positive
Magnificent Movie. The action is great. Character development is awesome.,positive
"I could nitpick this film, but its such a triumph of a reboot in every regard, and such a pleasurable quintessential action movie with every dept on all cylinders that not enjoying every aspect of this movie is an exercise in futility. Watching with a raucous, amped crowd after Secret Cinema, cheering and whooping at Bond's successes, tortures, and emergences from water in his trunks, Casino rarely shows its age even though it's 13 years old. It's still an invigorated, relevant, creative and sure-footed franchise at this point; every frame and every scene has a myriad of little details that flesh out the world, and make the film feel grounded even though it hits the franchise-high notes of spy-fantasy. A brazen, brutish, excessive Bond film reboot that I have almost nothing more to say about than has already been written. The decision to use previous reboot director Martin Campbell is welcome and clever and the holdover of Judi Dench as M is as obvious as it is surprising. Art house flourishes; the snapshot in the cut of the section chief's family photo as he's shot, a creatively integrated gun barrel sequence, the Bond-to-CCTC camera cut, and more, elevate the material and prove it as something different. Mads Mikelson is such a menacing and out-there newcomer at the time that it's hard to remember that he's just a banker and not a maniacal evil villain which is a strength. And with Mr. White, the film manages to build a franchise without ever looking like it's trying to. The film is bloated and the running time and sheer variety in it makes it a film not just easily put on, but as a flagship evening film with buddies, it has all the whizbang action and badassery and all the clever stings of dialogue you can smirk about. But overall it ticks basically every box and is still, almost ten years later, a hallmark of the action summer blockbuster genre. The sumptuous music, the sharp editing, the electric photography, the enrapturing and devilish Eva Green, and the hard, dead eyes of Craig's broken Assassin make it a film to remember and to heartily recommend. Bonus opening credits review: Aptly taking Bond into the videogame age and using the mocap to spice up the notion of watching a film that will revolve around a card game is clever. The lack of exploited women enforces the masculinity of this iteration and makes it feel a little sports gamey. The cheesy music is the right kind of cheesy as opposed to the cringey ""00"" bullet holes and 'status approved' cheesiness that is eventually saved by that ice cold walk into the light and steely blue eyed look as a focal point of Craig's Bond. Someone needs to bring Campbell and Baird back to the franchise.",positive

"Digno de las películas originales, con una trama que atrapa y un ritmo frenético cargado de acción de la mejor calidad, los diálogos son exquisitos y las actuaciones memorables. Una película que no podes perderte si amas el cine de acción y espías",positive

"A generic action film which feels more like Mission Impossible than the traditional Bond Film. No signature gadgets or doomsday weapons. Nothing memorable to think about after watching, except that Vesper's irrational decision to lock herself in the elevator - why would she commit suicide?",negative
"After all of the silly, over-the-top, and campy-natured entries in the Bond franchise, Casino Royale delivers a grittier, darker, and more human take on the James Bond character with Daniel Craig and makes for the best Bond movie in the franchise yet that has intense, exciting, and very well-shot action scenes and shows some emotion and vulnerability in its characters that was rarely seen in previous Bond movies. Casino Royale is not only a great Bond movie, but a great action movie.",positive
"The 007 franchise was running low on actors and plot lines. The action was becoming dull, and the story was becoming predictable. Daniel Craig stepped into the role with some doubt about his talent, but Casino Royale completely defied all expectations, becoming the best Bond movie, and possibly the best Daniel Craig movie. The action is well done, and the plot, well, what better than a spy movie set place in a casino? The truth is that this movie started a part of the franchise that would later become the best part of the 007 series. I applaud the directors for this wonderous film, with many fans coming back to the once dead franchise.",negative
"One of all time favourites, I can't stop rewatching Daniel Craigs first apperance as Bond, James Bond. I started watchin' bond after this one.",positive
Without a doubt Casino Royal is the absolute best James Bond movie! Daniel Craig is the best James Bond ever. I loved Sean Connery also but Daniel's seriousness and action is top notch. The movie production is first rate and exciting!,positive
Really enjoyed the First Craig Bond movie,positive
"Easily one of the best Bond films - trust me, I've seen them all. Daniel Craig is probably the best Bond in my opinion. I prefer him to Sean Connery because Connery's Bond was a bit pervy, whereas Craig's Bond seems more realistic - he's more cold (as an assassin should be), but he's fit and has style/charm. The script is miles better than the majority of the previous films. The plot is actually believable/realistic, there are no silly weapons, the villain is solid, and the action is some of the best in the entire franchise - the opening parkour sequence was great. My only complaint would be that some of the cinematography could have been more smooth rather than contains cuts/shakes, but it's far from the worst shaky cam. Finally, the soundtrack and opening song were great. It's a very enjoyable film that's well worth a watch.",positive
"When Pierce Brosnan was replaced by Daniel Craig I was completely shocked as many previous old fans of previous 007 movies. Craig lacked all the sexy, elegant, fun charisma and regular usage of special gadgets and weapons use of the previous 007 actors. He was blonde, with a bad attitude and didn't looked like he flitted on the James Bond character he was more like a Bruce Willy's Die Hard character, he evolved on the next movies to really earn the 007 right character. Great for him.",negative
"One if the only Bond film that's true to the book. Brings the humanity to Bond that was missing for so long. Well acted and directed, this is now the neo-classic Bond film by which others are measured.",positive
"Casino Royale is a very awesome Bond flick that doesn't let up being entertaining and even very emotional, plus it has the best Bond song ever.",positive
As much as I like this Bond Movie I cringe at the vague similarities to the Original Casino Royale. It took time to get used to it and value this movie on its own merit. Daniel Craig almost stands out from the other Bond Movies but is close enough I do consider it the main core of Bond. He brings a completely new energy to the series and makes it his own.,positive
"Bond is Back! Daniel Craig is almost perfect for this role. Movie has good action, suspense, and drama.",positive
"The best bond film since ""Goldfinger"".",positive
It's the best bond movie.,positive
Best bond movie ever.. there is no chance of disliking this movie..plot of this movie is like never seen before.. enjoyed alot.,positive
all of Craig's James Bond are worth it but Mads Mikkelsen's villain is exceptional in this one,positive
"The movie was so interesting in the respect it paid a lot more homage to Bond and M, and their initial relationship. The addition of Bond's love that eventually died made it even more captivating.",positive
Arguably the best of Craig as Bond,positive
"Its hard to beat the classics, such as 'Goldfinger' and OHMSS, but this is certainly the best film in the series and, honestly, one of the best films of the 21st century.",positive
"Campbell and Craig had an easy job to do, just not to make the same mistakes, and scoffing off the limitations, it is a clear qualifier. Casino Royale Campbell has evolved. A lot. And keeping toe to toe with the ever-changing show business, he has quickly managed to grasp the essence of the crisp that this generation craves for. But mind you, it still doesn't make Martin Campbell, the director, the finest of all. In fact, looking at the 1-0-1 criteria of filmmaking, he may be able to JUST qualify as one. Let's take the Airport chase sequence, for instance. First of all it's one smooth ride, with all the elements of the scene mapped out neatly on the screen where its fast and gritty choreography makes the best of the run. Now as far as this was concerned, it is actually Campbell informing us with news, dry news. What it fails to capture majorly, is the momentum of all the action. It's not that we don't get it, we are just asked to reach out for it, it isn't served us up front on the table. If these are its cons, then pros have to be the performances and the cast. But quickly before we sink into Daniel Craig's thunderous blue eyes, another thing Campbell places elegantly in the film, is how the time has passed in any circumstances, the selected highlights in both the narration and execution are subtle and exhilarating. So now, Craig.. should we just gaze at him or appreciate his exceptionally powerful scene with Mads Mikkelsen as he tortures him brutally. The humor that has been questioned many a times is twisted and turned so beautifully in here that even a worthy one-liner doesn't make us laugh but leaves a jarring dramatic impression on us. Eva Green with her love track doesn't have that amount of electricity in her romance as that poker table does which ironically is negatively motivated, something that the theme of Casino Royale shares.",negative
A fresh Bond reboot.,positive
"There aren't many, but this is one of those perfect films. A film that simply doesn't have anything that could be done better in it.",positive
"The first of the Daniel Craig ""gritty"" Bond series. The best of the bond films. A post 9-11 Bond flic that manages to incorporate the classic bond elements that defined the series, while establishing itself as a new movie series. its got it all, a memorable bad guy with an over the top plan, an attractive bond girl, nice cars and clothes, and a poker tournament to stop terrorists.",positive
"Featuring the performance of Daniel Craig's career, ""Casino Royale"" leaves it's mark as the best Bond film and quite possibly the best action film of all time.",positive
Ah! This film and Thunderball are pretty close to their source novels. (Though Casino had to be modernized for 21st. century audiences). Well done!,positive
"Is this the best Bond movie ever? Maybe, but ask someone who's seen them all. This movie has intrigue, love, deceit, bad guys, good guys, subtlety, and everything else you'd want in a spy thriller.",positive
The best Craig Bond of the series,positive
Far more than a Bond entry. 'Casino Royale' is an all around great action movie but also works quite well as a character study.,positive
"I remember hating this movie when it first came out. I’m a Pierce Brosnan guy and this lacked all the humor, the charm, the jokes, the girls, the gadgets etc. Seeing it a couple years later, I love this movie! It’s now hard to go back to the older bond movies because I love this newer style. It has grit, style, intense fighting and editing sequences, the most amazing heart pumping casino game of cards, twists and turns, a really compelling love interest, it just has everything you want in a James Bond movie! Awesome way to introduce the new James Bond. Hands-down one of the best action movies ever.",positive
"Still my favorite of the Craig Bond films, Casion Royale is a gritty, tension filled, action packed, and tragic tale of the origins of 007.",positive
The best movie with Daniel Craig like a James Bond,positive
Another amazing 007 film!!!,positive
My favorite Bond movie.,positive
"This is Daniel Craig's debut as James Bond and boy, did he introduce himself to the world of the famed agent with a bang! It gave the franchise a much-needed facelift when Pierce Brosnan had run out of 007 gas and the series was crying for a contemporary badass hero we could all look up to and drool over. Craig hits the mark on all accounts and is joined by a star-studded cast of darlings of the silver screen (Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Judi Dench) in a dizzying plot drenched with energy that feels like witnessing the birth of a new, action-packed, glossy universe to host Bond's 21st century adventures. Even though Ian Fleming's novel precedes the film by more than 50 years, the script does a great job of adapting the story for the modern tug-of-war between political and business power plus the seductive, glamorous forces at play in this new saga. The casino and high-stakes poker tournament symbolise the tension superbly, and the game sequence sustains anticipation and is as engrossing as any of the dramatic action filling Bond's mission with misfires and intrigue. This is James Bond 3.0 - blonde, calculating, ruthless and unstoppable in his cold charm, table tricks and devastating one-liners. Source: https://bojoko.com/stories/gambling-movies/.",positive
One of my favorite Bond saga movie. Eva Green amazing!!! Daniel Craige shows great performance. Not tired to watch again and again!,positive
"This is a very good movie, but might have been better if it was not tied to the Bond franchise. Daniel Craig lacks the suaveness needed for Bond, instead just coming across as a blunt instrument.",positive
The greatest action film ever made,positive
"This is the badass Bond that will reinvigorate the Bond franchise which has been slackening for some years now. Daniel Craig is amazing as James Bond- I love Pierce Brosnan but Craig owns this role like he was born to play it. Casino Royale has not only re-invented James Bond, but made him relevant for the 21st century. The target audience has shifted. Although there's nothing in Casino Royale that will exclude teenagers, this 007 is aimed squarely at adults. The November release date is also perfect - the film is almost too dark and serious for the kind of lighthearted, mindless fun we associate with summer blockbusters. The action is amazing but brutal(gone are the clean kills associated with Dalton or Brosnan) and many times Bond gets his ass handed to him which feels real. If you haven't seen a Bond film then Casino Royale is a great film to start. (Daniel Craig owns as James Bond, must watch).",positive
"One of the best action movies ever made. It contains every aspect that make the action genre blossom - perfect cinematography and choreography, extremely intense and exciting action sequences, an extraordinary story, an outstanding lead performance by Daniel Craig, a compelling love interest, an emotional ending, the right amount of humour, an interesting villain and a terrific ending to every single act - Casino Royale reinvents Bond and provides brutal and breathless results. I adore this film and cannot praise it enough but it's a shame that Quantum of Solace was extremely disappointing and only ok at best.",positive
"It is the distilled essence of the original James Bond. A human being without fancy gadgets or technology or British jokes. Punishing the body to get the job done. Introducing the viewer to secret concepts linked to the double zero licensing process. Showing also the hidden side and psychology of the character. See also how he falls in love (magnificent Eva Green), and how the cold legend is forged (and reborn). For me the best film in James Bond series. Daniel Craig is very good, but somehow rapidly fades away in following films of the franchise.",positive

"Casino Royale puts James Bond into the real world and delivers what to me is quite simply the best bond film and one of the best films of the 2000s. This film has it all. Tight narrative focus, incredible action sequences, extremely tense direction, sleek cinematography, pristine old fashioned editing, and an ambitiously large story that keeps focus on the man, Bond. And Bond has not been better. A vulnerable cruel assassin that tries to have a conscious and do good but is constantly being beaten down. Daniel Craig owns the screen in an Oscar worthy performance as Bond. But what shocks me the most is the series's best villain, Le Chiffre, a complete equal to the great James Bond that is able to balance menace and humanity brilliantly with the incredible Mads Mikkelsen in the role. Casino Royale is the kinda movie that can be talked about and hyped up but once you see it, it becomes a truly epic experience of thrills and entertainment.",positive
"Soft reboot done right. Good cast (Daniel Craig, Mads Mikkelsen and Judi Dench) and camera work is what makes this movie good. Story has some problems (like the unnecessarily extended ending)",positive
Amazing start to a new James Bond.,positive
"After the mess what Die Another Day (2002) was, the Bond series was given a reset button with great results. Casino Royale explores Bond's dark and gritty side, a side we have not seen since the underrated Timothy Dalton.",positive
Daniel Craig... The very best James Bond ever!!,positive
"""Casino Royale"" displays the true embodiment of what 007 should be and who he really is. Everything about this movie is done right.",positive
"Best Bond movie, ever. Violence is ugly. Killing people is messy. Devices break. The women are smarter than the men. Just like real life.",positive
"My favorite Bond movie. Great piece of fusion of action, thriller, emotions. Bravo",positive
"9/10 Dark, brooding, and exciting, Casino Royale successfully brought back the beloved franchise with Daniel Craig's haunted version of 007.",positive
"The best Bond movie of all time, one of my favorite movies of all time, and one of the best action movies of all time. Daniel Craig IS James Bond for me and the stunts and action sequences to this movie are still among the best to ever be put to screen. Eva Green as his foil and love interest makes for the single greatest “Bond girl” in the history of the franchise and its by a comfortable margin. Simply put this movie will be forever rewatchable. 5 out of 5 all day long",positive
"Daniel Craig's Bond takes out the silliness of the Brosnan era but takes the thrills of it leaving a grim Bond movie with thrills and explosions throughout. Casino Royale also includes a remarkably strong plot which involves him trying to take down the mathematical genius Le Chiffre by playing poker! I mean apart from the fact that any normal person would kick the bucket, if lucky a third of the way through I think anyone would want to be in Bond's position. This is one of the best 007 films yet. -8.5/10",positive
This is an awesome Bond film.Mikkelsen is a great villain...one of the best bond films ever.,positive
"The best Bond ever made. Daniel Craig not only makes Bond his own, but is also the greatest actor to play the c,assign character. It is full of action, suspense and tells a great story. Casino Royale is not just a great 007 movie, but a great movie as a whole.",positive
"After a 4 year hiatus, the producers of the Bond series took the opportunity to completely revamp the series with Daniel Craig stepping in as Bond for the first time. All continuity with the earlier movies was dispensed with, and Craig plays Bond as a brand new 00 agent in this adaptation of Fleming's first Bond novel. It certainly is a fresh approach. Craig is certainly the most physical Bond, and this film focuses on really raw, intense and realistic action sequences. It's one of the best Bond films. Unfortunately, Craig's tenure in the role has been extremely uneven.",positive
"By far the best James Bond film so far. Daniel Craig's 007 is a cold-hearted bastard for sure, but he is charismatic and has a very dry sense of humor. Mads Mikkelsen portrays an intimidating antagonist in Le Chiffre, a man who owes money to a terrorist group. I buy the romance between Vesper and Bond, and it does a good job of showing that 007 is a very tragic figure, and will never have a happy or normal life. I honestly don't have much criticism for this film. I also really like how they modernized the gunbarrel sequence in the intro, followed by Chris Cornell's ""You Know My Name"" ( which, in my opinion, is the best Bond song to date) Badass movie.",positive
"You can hardly get a harder franchise reboot than Casino Royale which is almost entirely different from all the previous James Bond films. Some of the changes are done for the better and some for the worse. The lack of humor is problematic as the film is too dark at times and too serious. Bond being objectified this time around is an interesting choice that, although at times excessive, mostly worked in the film's favor as did Daniel Craig's more humanized portrayal of the character and his inexperience as an agent. The film is overlong and the romance arrived way too late in the game, but still this is an engaging, frequently even touching and very interesting Bond film that ended up being mostly a successful experiment.",positive
It’s ok. Not my favorite.,negative
"An amazing action film to start, Daniel Craig's breakthrough performance brings the charisma and seriousness and molds it into the fantastic 007 that is showed in this film, the gripping action scenes and the darkness bring the effective new set of films to a new set of fans.",positive
"Daniel Craig burst onto the scene as James Bond in the gritty reboot Casino Royale. With the atrocity that was Die Another Day, it seemed like the 007 franchise had been destroyed. People doubted Craig, saying he didn't look the part. It didn't take long to prove them all wrong in just what might be the best action movie of the 2000s. The character has been stripped of his gadgets, suaveness, even his prettiness, and turned into a violent, troubled brute who must use his training and dogged determination to succeed. Gone is the campiness of the Moore and Brosnan eras, or the professionalism that Connery and Dalton displayed. The film opens in black and white, reminiscent of film noir, and sets a proper tone: espionage is no longer as glamorous as it once seemed. If one wanted to get into the franchise, this would be the perfect place to start, as it is the origin story of the secret agent. Of all the actors, Craig probably delivers the best Bond performance. He displays a level of psychopathy not seen since Sean Connery in Dr. No, but gradually becomes more humanized as the picture progresses, with various elements coming together to fully form the iconic spy we know. The supporting cast also does a great job. Eva Green provides a complex turn as Vesper, one of only two women Bond truly falls in love throughout the whole series. Mads Mikkelsen isn't given too much to work with as Le Chifre, but it's also nice to see that the villain is humanized here too. He's not a maniac set of world domination, but a man pushed into a corner who must do what he can to survive. The film has some fantastic set pieces such as the Madagascar parkour chase, the poker game, a certain excruciating torture scene, and the climatic fight in some crumbling Venice apartments. David Arnold's score harkens back to the work of John Barry on the early Bond films, and the underrated theme song by Chris Cornell adds to the impact. By turning 007 into a human being and portraying him in an air of moral ambiguity, the filmmakers have made the right choice. It's a strong contender for best Bond flick of them all, and even if it's not, it's at least top three.",positive
"Casino Royale was the first of the James Bond book series, and this movie is nearly the 25th in the movie series. Too much emphasis on violence, and long Hollywood stunt action scense, all in all pretty fake. Judi Dench as M was refreshing.",negative
"I'm sorry to say Sean Connery fans, Daniel Craig is my favourite Bond because he is more grounded and gives the movie a more serious take on the character. ""Casino Royale"" has great action, awesome performances from Craig, Mikkelson, Dench and Green. While Daniel Craig has had his ups and downs playing Bond. He has always been the standout of all of his outings.",positive
"Good, but not so well proportioned. There were some major plot holes that wouldn't have taken much covering up, but the editing was superb. A must watch for Daniel Craig fans, but a bit of a let down based on critics scores alone.",negative
This movie is exactly what a reboot needs to do.Daniel Craig is fantastic to this film and by far one of the best book adaptations ever made.Very excited for Bond 25!!!!,positive
"In my opinion this is the best Bond and I watched all of them. They brilliantly introduce a new character with Daniel Craig and I really love seeing Bond stumble and fail for the first time. On the other hand they still keep the old characteristics like the giant ego and confident humour. The story itself is not on the same page as Skyfall, but it stays interesting and partly opaque. Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen and the characters they brilliantly depict keep me thrilled while I get to see cool action and impressive pictures. In the end it is not only the best bond but also the best revival of any franchise.",positive
Daniel Craig is my James Bond Can't wait for Bond 25,positive
"Best Bond ever, pure class...",positive
"The Bond films get a welcome overhaul with Casino Royale in this gritty, brutal, glossy thriller that feels worlds apart from previous movie Die Another Day. The best Bond since Connery, Craig manages to be physically impressive but flawed and vulnerable too. The film is bursting with thrilling action sequences - a parkour chase around a building site, a race to stop a bomb going off in an airport - but it's in the quieter moments, such as the high stakes poker game or the tender scenes between Bond and Vesper, where it really shows its class.",positive
"(92/100) A long, well paced, story with great storytelling and action scenes. 007 feels like 007 again.",positive
My favorite Daniel Craig Bond,positive
I mean... Casino Royale is the first James Bond movie I ever saw and Daniel Craig just sold me the role completely.,positive
"Great direction and a well thought out script make Casino Royale worth watching, although investment in its plot and characters are sometimes hard to find.",negative
"Despite the film’s faithfulness to its pompous and chauvinist heritage, I digress Casino Royale is exactly what James Bond should be.",positive
"For sure my favourite James Bond between the ones, not many, I have watched. Not only action packed, but also a bit wittier than the last ones.",positive
"""Casino Royale"" touched me in ways I never expected from a ""James Bond"" movie to touch me. It had equal parts action and soul and let its protagonist become a more humane version of himself. I have not experienced the previous James Bond era but Daniel Craig sure sold the part for me. There's a quality in the James Bond movies, but ""Casino Royale"" adds another layer.",positive
"Featuring not only the series's best action, but its best drama, Casino Royale coheres as not only the greatest Bond film ever made, but one of the all-time great spy thrillers, with a haunted leading performance by the brilliant Daniel Craig, and a beautifully tragic romance with Eva Green's Vesper Lynd.",positive
A movie about playing poker...,negative
finally an action bond flick that has its twists and turns,positive
Incredible action sequences and an interesting plot help drive this movie but the truly unique aspect of the film is the humanization of Bond and his counterpart Le Chiffre bringing two characters down to earth to create an immersive action thriller.,positive
awesome and great movie of the james bond franchise.,positive
"Easily a top 3 entry in the series without question. a fantastic character piece of one of the most iconic action/spy heroes in film. Great characters, fantastic plot and action. 10/10",positive
"Many may argue that this is the best bond film, but me personally, I would only say that it is the third best. The main reason being that it is not as much of a bond film as the majority of it's predecessors. Otherwise it might actually be my second pick for the title of best bond movie, respectively behind Goldfinger. But I must admit, that in the end, I did thoroughly enjoy the portrayal of James bond as more of a real person, and that offering what feels like a more complete and involving story is a pleasant surprise. Something that is to an extent, unfortunately lacking in the bond series. Fortunately though, for the sake of us fans, Casino Royale does utterly prove that Daniel Craig is without a shadow of a doubt, capable of qualifying as one of the best actors to have ever said, ""The name's Bond. . . James Bond.""",positive
"Great bond movie, thoroughly enjoyed DC in the role.",positive
My favorite James Bond movie and has a great theme to it! I love poker and that's one of the main things I like about it! Daniel Craig does a great job with the role as James Bond and Mads Mikkelson does great as Le Chiffre. If you like James Bond and/or poker you need to watch this!,positive
"The James Bond reboots kick off here with Casino Royale. I'm not going to lie when I say this is one of the best Bond films ever made, probably on the top three podium. Casino Royale is not only good as a Bond film, but as an independent spy film in its own right; it's a delightfully dark twist on the Brosnan age gimmicks, grounding this new Bond in reality, with Daniel Craig assisting in a striking performance of the 00 agent. The film takes a riveting pace, with captivating action sequences around every corner and a script so quick if you blink you won't know what's going on. The supporting cast is also largely good as well, with Eva Green Bond-girling wonderfully as Vesper, providing more depth and sincerity than one might expect and Judi Dench continuing to play M with delightful coldness. Bond's adversary Le Chiffre, played by Mads Mikkelsen leaves a lot to the imagination, settling as a sub-standard villain in an above-standard film. The film also suffers from being overlong, with a slightly lengthy build-up, that results in, despite effective writing and direction, a lingering pace issue towards the end of the film. Far too long was spent in that sanatorium that's my point. Largely, however, Casino Royale is a fantastic thriller, devoid of that irritating glamour so captured by previous Bonds, and grounding the character in a scarily familiar reality, that provides for surely one of the best Bond films of all time.",positive
"Despite the film's faithfulness to its pompous and chauvinistic heritage, I digress Casino Royale is exactly what James Bond should be.",positive
"Not only my favourite bond film of all time, it's my favourite film of all time. I love this film!",positive
I thought that the movie was great we watched it at camp and all I wanted to do is watch the rest,positive
"great performance from Daniel Craig, and the unpredictable plot twist.",positive
The best James Bond film.,positive
"One of and probably the second best Bond film, Casino Royale is also one of the best movie origin stories ever told. Brought down only by its 2.5-hour run time, the film successfully introduces Daniel Craig's Bond, and Craig delivers one of his best performances. The supporting cast are all at the top of their game, and Mads Mikkelson is perfect as the villainous Le Chiffre. The script is very well-written, the action is fun and intense, the opening credits sequence is very underrated, and the film as a whole is simply fantastic.",positive
D. Craig des his own stunts which i think is cool.,positive
"A fresh new take on Bond that still retains the same fun tone of the best in the series, Casino Royales presents the best Bond since Sean Connery, a classic villain, and incredible scenes of tension and action on and off the poker table, making this one of the very best that the series has to offer.",positive
"Gritty and dark, but also extremely smart, Casino Royal kickstarts Daniel Craig's version of 007 in all its tense fashion.",positive
"Best reboot for a film series ever. Starring a blonde Bond Daniel Craig it is more gritty then ever. Containing Strong Violence, Sex references and Language and a Cringy scene containing bond being tortured. this should be rated a 15 Cast James Bond/007: Daniel Craig Vesper Lynnd: Eva Green Le Chiffre: Mads Micklestone Felix Lieter: Jeffrey Wight M: Judi Dench Rene Mathis:Giancarlo Gianninia Mr White: Jesper Christian",positive
So much pleasure around it's hard to fatham they are fighting!,positive
"Dark and realistic, Casino Royale excellently embodies a more mature tone. With none of the goofy gadget elements, Daniel Craig's portrayal is more rustic and authentic, showing a Bond who is more human than any other.",positive
"Casino Royale - Filme dirigido pelo Martin Campbell, direção muito boa sem CGI, apenas efeitos práticos. Roteiro, melhor parte, tudo se encaixa no final, com direito a plot twist. A ação e drama são muito bem divididas, e as duas funcionam perfeitamente, dentro da historia. Elenco fantastico, destaque para a Eva Green como Vesper Lynd. Trilha sonora muito boa também, com a musica original ""You Know My Name"". Nota: 9.2",positive
"Daniel Craig is terrific as Bond. This movie has excellent action scenes, a great plot, great villain and bond girl. 9.4/10",positive
Casino Royale is a movie filled with strong performances especially Eva Green's who makes Vesper Lyynd possibly the best bond girl to grace the 007 franchise along with a menacingly good turn from Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre and a dark and gritty but powerful performance from Daniel Craig this includes an elegant and cleverly written screenplay plus a hauntingly beautiful take on storytelling making Casino Royale the best bond film yet,positive
Craig actually works as Bond and his lack of range and charm works with the brutal tone of the movie.,negative
"Probably my favorite bond movie. Super engaging, great acting, beautiful scenery. One of the best foot chases ever. The poker game is very interesting as well. I'll definitely rewatch it in the future, though it does get a little long.",positive
"Daniel Craig delivers as the new Bond in this sleek, sexy film featuring gritty action and an underrated villain.",positive
Craig works as Bond.,negative
"From out of nowhere comes this 'series reboot' of the 007 franchise that seeks to explain the Bond -hitherto very thin- backstory. As such, Casino Royale thankfully has very little to do with the late '60s comedy (or the 1950s tv production featuring an all American Jimmy Bond). It is a slick adaptation of the Fleming story with liberal doses of sub-plotting and a shift from its cold war environment to the contemporarised Islamic terrorist-funded world of 2006. Director Martin Campbell has done a fine job with this film, re-inventing 007 as capably as he did with GoldenEye a decade earlier. Gone are the cringeworthy double-entendres, gimicks, gadgetry,and formulaic storylines. In their place is a tough, occasionally smirking blonde Bond played with a steely conviction by English actor Daniel Craig, matched with a story about betrayal. French actress Eva Green is stunning as double agent Vesper Lynd and Mads Mikkelsen makes a creepy, disturbing villain with one eye that weeps blood (usually when he's losing a high stakes game of poker). I have shaved the fourth star down to a half simply due to the fact that it is also a very long movie (longer than it needs to be) and some of the action sequences (while brilliantly staged) could have used some culling in the editing process but that said, it's one of the best Bond movies in years.",negative
"Daniel Craig is James Bond 007 and Wow! An over the top, no fucking around Bond film!",positive
"An excellent Bond film. Perfectly retro and fun, while still feeling real. The performances are exactly what they needed to be, the cinematography lets us feel like we're part of the action, and man oh man is the action great. The set-piece sequences are so creative and wild. Right from the first fight scene it starts showing off how inventive it is. And when the first chase scene started I was blown away with how surprising it all was. After all, why have Bond perfectly chase after and mimmick a parkour expert when he can burst through drywall or poorly land on a sandy rooftop? This is one of the best spy films of all time.",positive
Craig made me a huge bond fan love this movie.,positive
"Rebooting a film franchise can often come across as an act of desperation: an admission that the characters or story have been taken as far as they can possibly go, and a cynical means of luring in a new generation on the pretence of giving them ownership over 'their version' of a property. Perversely, the more successful a given reboot is, the easier it seemingly becomes to pull this same trick again the second that a particular instalment mildly underperforms. It may seem hard to believe in an age of cinematic universes where knowledge of superhero continuity is a badge of honour - but then we remember that Spider-Man and Superman have both been rebooted twice in the space of a decade. Die Another Day marked the Bond series' 40th anniversary in the most deeply disappointing way possible, serving up a glorified greatest hits compilation which played out like reheated leftovers. Faced with its deserved critical kicking and Pierce Brosnan's subsequent departure, the guardians of the series must have felt that starting from scratch and going back was the only way forward. Casino Royale is a worthy exception to the rule that reboots are pointless and underwhelming, delivering just the sort of reinvention that the franchise needed. It may even be the best film in the entire series. Part of the secret behind the Bond series' longevity is that it has always adjusted its character and storylines to the culture and politics of a given period. Sometimes it has done this so nakedly that the films in question date badly, whether it's Live and Let Die's attempts at aping Shaft, The Man with the Golden Gun cashing in on Enter the Dragon, or Moonraker trying and failing to be the next Star Wars. Often Bond has been at his best when he acknowledges his mortality and the world changing around him, while retaining the character elements which made him so popular in the first place. Goldeneye made a big deal about the Cold War ending, but it still felt like a story in which Bond had a rightful place. The spectre hanging over Casino Royale, and indeed all of the Daniel Craig era, is the Bourne series. The first three films shifted the goalposts of what constituted a modern action-thriller, innovating with its gripping storylines, sharp camerawork and relatable yet remarkable protagonist. Even Brosnan admitted that the series would have had to raise its game in the face of what The Bourne Identity did; watching that and Die Another Day now, it's hard to believe that they came from the same decade, let alone the same year. Casino Royale manages to match The Bourne Supremacy for quality, borrowing some of its aesthetic touches (particularly in the chase sequences) while also capturing the intrigue of Ian Fleming's original novel. Like Paul Greengrass, Martin Campbell understands the need to knit action and character scenes together to create a holistic, gripping package; the action feels like an integral and natural part of the drama, rather than interrupting it in order to show off the budget. Campbell brings the same calm, steady and methodical touch that he brought to Goldeneye; having saved Bond from irrelevance once, he does it again in some style. Skyfall so often gets praised for acknowledging Bond's past while still being modern and relevant, but Casino Royale manages to pull off this same trick, and arguably does it slightly better. Where Skyfall consciously tips its hat to the older films through costumes, characters or props (such as the iconic Aston Martin DB5), Casino Royale is more subtle; all the classic elements are there, but they've been modernised and refined so that they make more sense in the real world. It's still fitting for Bond to drive an Aston Martin, and it's a nice touch to see its distant predecessor roll by. But it wouldn't make sense for Bond's car to have many gadgets that he doesn't need, and having the car be wrecked to save Vesper makes complete sense. Where Roger Moore or Brosnan's films glorified the gadgets, this restores some welcome credibility and keeps the hardware under wraps unless absolutely necessary. Along these same lines, the screenplay takes all the best elements of Fleming's novel and transposes them into a contemporary setting. It still has all the glamour of the classic casino scenes from the Sean Connery era, but the playful banter and flirting has been replaced with high stakes, tense glances and much more serious consequences. Le Chiffre's relationships with arms dealers and dodgy speculation on the stock market felt current for its day and still feels very fresh; great effort is expended to ground the character's motivations while maintaining an air of intrigue, mystery and threat. The film takes itself seriously, but not too seriously; it wants to have fun, but it puts credibility above out-and-out entertainment, unlike many of Moore's entries in the canon. Le Chiffre's characterisation is also an interesting departure from what the Bond villain archetype has become. Where the likes of Drax, Stromberg and Blofeld wanted to single-handedly destroy or take over the world, Le Chiffre is essentially a middle-man; he is to the Craig era what Kristatos was in For Your Eyes Only, but better written and with a more interesting, more murky motivation. Like Bond, he is ultimately a pawn of bigger forces who struggles at times not to buckle under the pressure (as the torture scene demonstrates); by making him so small, he becomes more believable and more intimidating, even without the bleeding eye. He may look like the lead singer of Franz Ferdinand in his haircut and dress sense, but Mads Mikkelson plays him brilliantly, bringing a cold, dead-eyed feel to the character which both intrigues and repulses an audience. Creating convincing poker scenes in films is pretty difficult. The vast majority of efforts go for a highly stylised or choreographed approach, where audience expectations are pandered to through needless editing trickery; think of the final hand in The Cincinnati Kid, or the royal flush sequence in Maverick. Casino Royale's poker scenes may be more stylised than those in, say, The Sting or Rounders, but they are still very well-executed with good pacing and a frisson of unpredictability. What really makes them work, however, is the build-up in the script; there are little poker motifs dotted throughout, with comments about tells and misdirection. Because the film makes such a big theme out of bluffing and people not being what they seem, the card games don't feel like isolated set-pieces, and the later developments with Mathis and Vesper feel credible and yet still surprising. The relationship between Craig's Bond and Vesper is very much a modern-day version of the relationship between George Lazenby's Bond and Tracey in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. It isn't just that both characters ultimately don't make it past the final reel; the characters are both instrumental in the making of Bond, an affront and a challenge to his impulsive, playboy instincts and a safe refuge from the madness of his job and the people he has to kill. Eva Green is every bit as gripping and electric on screen as Diana Rigg before her; Vesper goes toe-to-toe with Bond and we get genuine character development, making her betrayal and death all the more shocking and heartbreaking. Craig's Bond is a changed man by the end of the film - it's just a pity that the resolution to his heartbreak in Quantum of Solace was as underwhelming and mishandled as the similar attempt in Diamonds Are Forever. The heartbreak surrounding Vesper brings us onto another of Casino Royale's great successes: it hurts. Desmond Llewellyn's Q may have advised Bond that he should never let his enemies see him bleed, but the best Bond films have never been afraid of putting him through the mill, getting him into dangerous situations which can only be resolved at great cost - a cost often numbed by women and alcohol. The fight scenes in Casino Royale feel brutal, just as they should do; it isn't interesting to have someone waltz through conflict as though it was nothing. The torture scene and the defibrillator scene are great in isolation, but they are matched by Bond's emotional torment of losing Vesper. For the first time since Timothy Dalton's era - or Goldeneye at a push - Bond's pain feels real and meaningful. All of which brings us to Daniel Craig as Bond. While his subsequent films have been hit-and-miss, his performance here is more than enough to silence those who criticised his casting (all those 'James Blonde' jokes sound all the more desperate now). He takes the suffering and burnt-out approach that Dalton brought and fuses it with some of Connery's unabashed cool to create a truly modern and contemporary Bond. He also has the confidence to eschew convention as much as he chooses to reflect or inhabit it; we get a build-up to a cliched sex scene, but then he's quickly on his toes and back to the plot. Casino Royale is a great, gripping spy thriller and arguably the finest of all the James Bond films. While it is slightly too long and a little too candid with some of its product placement, it remains an extraordinary reinvention of a franchise which had long been in need of a boost. Craig impresses in his first and finest performance as Bond, and Martin Campbell directs with great common sense and precision to create a majestic and immensely enjoyable film. Whether looking at the newer films or the franchise as a whole, this has set a very high bar which has yet to be beaten.",positive
"When Casino Royale was released back in 2006, people hated the idea of Daniel Craig portraying the iconic James Bond character. People were nervous that he would destroy the franchise with blond hair and blue eyes, but everyone's hatred of the idea came to a sudden end once the film was released, and it turned out to be the one of the best Bond films ever. In Casino Royale, a terrorist organization is relying on a man with the name Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) to win at a high-skates poker game to retrieve the money. James Bond (Daniel Craig) is assigned to play in the game as well to prevent Le Chiffre from getting the money. Casino Royale is my favorite James Bond film. It did everything right, it had no problems at all, it was perfect. This movie did what a 007 film is supposed to do, it showed the dark side of the character, along with a reasonable amount of suspense. Most of the movie revolves around the actual poker game. The film also brings in one of the best Bond girls in the franchise, named Vesper Lynd (Eva green) who helps 007 with his assignment. This film highly resembles the Mission Impossible films, it features the same style of film. It is a very well written movie that doesn't fail to show the version of the character straight from his origins. It also revived the franchise after previous, 'less than stellar entries'. Over all, if you are a fan of the James Bond movies, I would highly recommend it to you. It was perfect. 5/5 stars",positive
watched it and loved it.,positive
It is wonderful to see the Bond series re-booted with a brilliant movie. Explores the start a young 007 learning from his mistakes during a mission. Daniel Craig performs the epic 007 role brilliantly and gives a grounded performance.,positive
Casino Royale is really good,positive
Solid but nothing more.,negative
"The high note of the Bond franchise, in my opinion. This film functions in a way that no other Bond film does; as both a strong Bond film that ticks nearly all of the proverbial boxes (while adding much needed depth to Bond as a person), and as a spectacularly effective action film. There's something uniquely nuanced about Craig's Bond in this particular installment. He feels self-deprecating in a way that no other James Bond has. Rather than relishing in being a suave super spy, he seems to despise the job and himself for being the one who has to do it. This is a brutal and calculated Bond that also happens to be a charming detective, rather than the latter being his sole attribute.",positive
Best James Bond movie of all time.,positive
"One of the very best Bond movies with a most gripping and wonderfully constructed casino card game sequence that is the equal of anything else in the movie. A nicely grounded more realistic plot and even the typically over-the-top action sequences feel more believable. It also boasts my favourite title sequence to date and an excellent choice of song to accompany it. The final act feels a little long, which is often a symptom of any movie in which the main villain is out if the picture sometime before the rest of the story is completed. And that is my only ""criticism"" which barely even qualifies as a nitpick at that. Not just an excellent Bond movie but an excellent movie full-stop.",positive
Daniel Craig turns Bond into an actual human. This movie is great. They have decided to get rid of the silliness that Bond is know for and are now taking the Bond movies more serious. This is a great first installment from the Daniel Craig Bond films.,positive
Loved this spin on the Bond movies. A great version with a gritty realistic update to the classic character,positive
"An excellent Bond film that has great suspense and yet is a more realistic and gritty Bond with a constantly riveting plot, even after the main bulk of the action and the main plot of the movie is over.",positive
"The more I watch this film the better it gets. It seems to have everything, including a character with depth and emotion.",positive
Best Bond movie ever made. Simply put.,positive
"WHAT I LIKED: Wow this really is a franchise reboot; not only does 'Casino Royale' re-energise and re-stylise Bond, it also brings in a level of sophistication that we've never seen before. Seriously, the STORY is so twisted and layered, yet unlike the convoluted political nonsense of a 'Mission: Impossible' film, it's personal and so it has high-stakes and flows really damn well. This is impressive on it's own as it keeps you captivated and engaged, but it's even more amazing when you consider how it sets up the next film and keeps you in the know and surprises you just the right amounts. Yes, if it sounds like it's achieved a lot, it has - for goodness sake not only is this an exciting revenge plot, a great spy-thriller and a gripping character tale - it's also the best love story of the franchise so far! But a sophisticated story isn't all that makes this movie; something was needed to lift things above that grittiness. Luckily, this film found that solace in Daniel Craig. My gosh is this guy a good Bond; bringing a steeliness to compliment the new-found tone, yet a charm and witt to make everything all the more enjoyable. You properly, properly root for the guy, and that's thanks to Craig's performance, as well as his relevance and arc in the overall story. He can do smooth, he can do cold and he can damn well do action and as a result he's already the best Bond since Connery. Put all that good stuff in a film with all the usual fun action, glorious locations and sweeping musical numbers? It's kind of a Bond movie, but it's something quite a bit more too. WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: A film this fresh and ambitious is bound to have problems, but the question is do they hinder the overall experience? Well, rarely; the only issue I have is that the overall tone is a little hard to adjust to - being such a fan of the classics. Having said that, in the words of 007 himself: ""do I look like I give a damn?"" Hmm I probably shouldn't, but I can say the feeling would have been less jarring had it stayed consistently dark throughout. VERDICT: I'd go as far as saying that the story in 'Casino Royale' is one of the biggest achievements in Cinema history. It engages, it flows and it works, and Daniel Craig elevates it even further. Just wow.",positive
Casino Royale is certainly one of the best Bond films due to the reimagining of the franchise to a quality that makes it feel genuine. The ability of appealing to classic Bond fans while still being distinctly unique makes this an evident success. Craig's Bond is exposed suspensefully through emotional and physical vulnerability that provides the character with some much needed depth. Thrilling realism at its finest.,positive
"IMO the best bond movie of all time. The action aren't stupid, the characters are great, and all that happens in the movie make some serious and enhancing plot development.",positive
"Perfect in every way. Not only is Daniel Craig one of the greatest versions of James Bond, Casino Royale might even be the best James Bond film we've ever been given. James Bond hasn't truly felt this organic and real since Goldfinger. Simply spectacular.",positive
A new Bond for a new generation.,positive
"My name is bond , James Bond; The name is enough!",positive
"James Bond is back and he is alive and well. Any questions about Daniel Craig's worthiness are thrown out almost immediately as we are handed a film filled to the brim with exquisite action and explosive emotion. I squirmed in my seat with delight as I have not done since I was a child. What ""Batman Begins"" did for that franchise, ""Casino Royale"" does, and more, for Bond. For a while it seemed that he might not be able to well exist outside the confines of the cold war, but here we are given an entirely modern Bond with enough nods to the original that we can't be too upset. Maybe it's because this is the last novel yet to be filmed in the traditional Bond manner and it is Ian Fleming who has stolen our hearts not this incarnation of the super spy. However I like to think that someone actually just got their act together and concentrated on the film itself as opposed to who they could get the most product placement money out of. Congratulations. James Bond will live on for at least one more generation, and maybe forever. Great set pieces and one of the best chase sequences not involving cars ever put on screen, blended with beautiful locations and even more lovely women add up to the perfect cocktail with the twisting story line acting as the lemon peel in the martini, holding it all together. Many will come out saying that this is the best Bond film ever and I can not rightly say they are wrong at this point. Only time will tell that tale. However every fan can be assured that this ranks amongst the very upper crust of Bond movies, and Craig is no Lazenby. He lends a harsh wit and a thuggish charm to the character and by the end he's no longer the new guy, he is Bond, James Bond. A masterpiece of popular film-making and the movie we have been waiting for all year.",positive
A superb entry into the Bond canon. Mikkelsen is superb.,positive
Absolutely wonderful. Fully captured the meaning of the book.,positive
The only good bond film Daniel Craig managed to do well! Although the plot was so well written that Ben Afleck could have pulled it off. This film is by no means a success because of Daniel Craig though. The rest of Daniel Craig's so call Bond appearances are all CRAP!!!!,negative
Best bond film. Wonderfully wrote and paced,positive
"Exciting, action-packed and tense, Casino Royale is not only one of the best James Bond films of all time but it also shows that Daniel Craig is one of the most perfect incarnations of James Bond ever created with a serious tone that's been missing in previous incarnations.",positive
"Quite possibly the best Bond movie of all time. Casino Royale has a stellar plot, blending thrilling action and intense drama perfectly, add the performance of Daniel Craig as James Bond and you have a classic. This movie perfectly shows how James Bond the man became 007 the MI6 agent, it's one of the highest points in the 007 franchise and one desperately needed after Die Another Day.",positive
Casino Royale represents a new shape of James Bond played by Daniel Craig. The story tells us about young and fresh Bond and his first assignments in secret service. Action combined with great stunts and practical effects sets a thrilling tone and gets us an amazing performance from Daniel Craig. Overall this movie successfully delivers an atmosphere of classic Sean Connery Bond with a lot of new elements in it. It has an unrepeatable adventurous feel and brings pleasure when watching.,positive
"Maintains a lot of what is expected in Bond films, but takes away the cheesiness and outrageousness. It should be the new archetype of remakes/reboots.",positive
"Casino Royale is probably the best James Bond movie ever made, a thrilling, suspenseful, fun action movie that shows Bond actually becoming the James Bond we all know, and him methodically fighting Le Chiffre instead of him just telling him he had his six and putting a bullet between his eyes.",positive
This is Bond at its absolute peak. Craig has infinite suave and bravado as 007 and the film oozes sensibility and style. It's a work of art and a master of its genre. It's a movie you can watch a hundred times over and never get sick of. Casino Royale has earned its place in my Top 5 Films of All Time.,positive
"10 out of 10: With Casino Royale, it turns the James Bond films from a few funny moments to a serious film. The action, intense scenes, and a great story make this the best Bond film.",positive
"Casino Royale consegue oferecer o estilo que fez os filmes da serie 007 um sucesso,além do roteiro e atuações sensacionais de Daniel Craig,Eva Green e Mads Mikkelsen.",positive
"El regreso de James Bond, y vuelve por todo lo alto. Un caso interesante, un diseño de producción precioso, un Bond glamoroso como debe ser, una chica Bond fuerte, con objetivos, motivaciones, y personalidad propia, y logró mantenerme intrigado a pesar de ser un total analfabeta en lo que a juegos de apuestas se refiere.",positive
"After 20 Bond movies (plus the original Casino Royale and Never Say Never Again) we find ourselves faced with the prospect of the first 'blonde' Bond... It's seems crazy to think we all doubted Daniel Craig's capability as our beloved 007. Casino Royale - the 21st Bond movie after the flop which was Die Another Day - has exhilarating action, crossed with tender emotions, exceptional performances all round and one of the strongest villains since the birth of Bond. Speaking about the originals, Casino Royale is without a doubt the best Bond yet... And arguably one of the greats of our generation. Verdict: A+",positive
Maybe the best bond film yet!,positive
"Craig's first Bond film is still his best. Very good transition from Light Hearted Pierce Brosnan, with his glacier surfing to this big, dark, brute. The car flip was absolutely awesome! Well done, Martin Campbell.",positive
"Arguably the best Bond film of all time. The narrative is well structured and the film is full of brilliant one liners. Alongside the amazing acting of Craig, Green and Mikkelson you get some brilliant action set pieces, a superb score and some amazing cinematography.",positive
"Casino Royale is the best James Bond film I have ever seen. Danial Craig is a very handsome men, and his performance is great. The silly James films in the past is not in comparison to this. Excellent thrilling action.",positive
"Casino Royale is an excellent feat, mixing James Bond thematic elements with modern action shooting in delivery of a very stylish, sumptuous Bond film that sets a high bar for all the spy film that follows. It is so thoroughly complete as a film that I couldn't find reasons why it is not a 10/10, because I very much enjoy the 2 hours of watching and such genre of filmmaking is my cup of tea. (Plot holes shall be blamed on Ian Fleming's original novel) In particular, I live how the scenes are cliche-free and cool, accentuating the badassery of Daniel Craig's Bond. The dialogues are very good. They appeared to be well-thought and was sometimes humorous. From ""Shaken or stirred? Do I look like a give a damn."" to ""or I'll kill her. Allow me to."" Old school humor in the lines also describes the character's situation and attitude in discreet ways are a shining aspect of the Bond film. Besides, how can one also not appreciate the acting chops by Daniel Craig, especially during the torture scene, and Eva Green's effort in portraying Bond's 101th bond girl, which has to be one of the more memorable ones amongst all of them. As for the small, detail aspects, the new Bond is given a personality and incredible build-up with scenes like the bomber murdering scene that showed his ego and Vesper's death scene that exemplified Bond's emotional vulnerability. His character was fully developed at the end and that in such graceful spontaneity. My favourite moment, which I am often overly elated to tell, is in the app. half an hour poker showdown bet. Le chliffe and James Bond. Before the game Bond told the waitress a bunch of description for his drink, being cool and unorthodox. He soon screwed the thing after an all-in lost in which Le chliffe won all his money, as he was asked choices for his drinks, and it looks like he ain't got no damn to give this time. Spot on.",positive
Favorite bond film so far,positive
"One of the best bond movies, shows a very real character that bleed and sweat.",positive
"Daniel Craig's first turn in the tux. Just as many franchises have gone ""The Dark Knight route"" meaning they have turned stories darker and grittier, the James Bond franchise is now following suit. Daniel Craig is the most fit and tough Bond we've had. He's not the best James Bond, but he's good. Sean Connery, Pierce Bronsnan, then Daniel Craig. Script was remarkable and despite the point of the film being just a poker game, it was still filled with suspense and excitement.",positive
One of the better bond movies,positive
"Cassino Royale Apostou na nostalgia dos clássicos,cheio de referências e um roteiro muito esperto e uma atuação impecável de Daniel Craig,Eva Green e Mads Mikkelsen.",positive
The most interesting game of poker I've ever seen.,positive
"If its not the GREATEST film ever made, its definately the greatest action film ever made.",positive
"Casino Royale might be the best 007 movie to date, very close with Skyfall.",positive
"Bond reborn! Daniel Craig brings a lot of new energy is this reboot of the series. We look into the (sorta) origins of How James Bond came to be. Another standout is Eva Green who is also incredible as his Handler/love interest, Vesper Lynd.",positive
A return to the classic bond appeal with the introduction of a modern grit that is very much needed after the silly over-the-top bond films of the 80's and 90's.,positive
Better than sky fall.,positive
"Forgetable theme song aside, this reinvention of James Bond is very much welcomed. Besides the opening credit rolls, there is very few things to remind you this is the 26th episodes of the special agent. There is no money penny, no special gadgets, no world domination, no cartoon characters. This is a serious thriller.",positive
"I've tried to like James Bond. I really have. I watched a number of the old films, before I got bored and gave up. Casino Royale was my attempt to like them again, but it reminded me of why I gave up in the first place. Casino Royale is a bloated, over-long affair with a severe lack of realism and a woefully under-utilised Mads Mikklesen. He could have easily been one of the best parts of the film, but he was criminally under-used. Casino Royale wasn't a complete failure. I did like some of its stylistic elements, such as the flashback scenes that were shot in black and white, but for the most part I found it boring and unengaging. Read my full review here:http://goo.gl/SQJaT4",positive
"For me, Martin Campbell has directed 2 films deserving of top 5 bond movies of all time (This and Goldeneye)",positive
"Daniel Craig nailed the younger, brasher Bond. Very enjoyable.",positive
"Casino Royale isn't just an amazing James Bond movie, its an amazing movie, period. The film is pretty much divided into 3 acts, with each one bringing something new to the table to keep things fresh. In fact, I could separately review each act as a stand-alone movie, and I would give each one a great review. This reboot of the beloved character is a darker spin on the franchise and is definitely deserving of that PG-13 rating. One scene in particular will really make you cringe in pain, especially if you are a man. The movie has great performances by Daniel Craig and proves all the naysayers wrong, because if you look back to a year before this movie came out, people were really skeptical. In the end, Casino Royale is a movie that is easily regarded as a classic. The direction, cinematography, acting, color grading, all work in harmony to bring a near-perfect movie.",positive
"One of the best Bond movies ever. The poker scenes could've been done a tad better imho, but everything else in this movie is done perfectly. The movie grips right you right from the start and never seems to let you go. Whether it's the action sequences or the tension filled scenes, the movie flows seamlessly and beautifully. Can't wait for the next one.",positive
"The best Bond to date, and that is largely because of the attention given to the source material-Ian Fleming's original novels. Craig's Bond is an assassin; it's not about suave, sexy women and gadgets. This intelligent assassin is on mission for Queen and Country. Le Chifre is a breath of fresh 007 air; gone are the repetitive films chronicling the copycat villains obsessed with overpowered satellites to destroy mankind. Welcome to 21st century, Mr. Bond.",positive
A really great intro into Daniel Craig's Bond,positive
"Casino Royale brings James Bond back on the map, and does an incredible job doing so.",positive
Daniel Craig is the next Sean Connery as Bond. James Bond.,positive
The beginning o my favorite Bond era,positive
"Casino Royale is directed by Martin Campbell and is the first Bond film starring Daniel Craig as the infamous agent. A new 00 agent for MI6, Bond is assigned with incapacitating a terrorist (Mads Mikkelsen) behind an attempted bombing of a plane. This is a fun and stylish Bond film. Daniel Craig is a very focused Bond, not so easily distracted by the lure of women. He is also an inexperienced Bond, lacking proper judgement in certain situations. It makes for a very relatable protagonist. Eva Green is also very strong as a British treasurer tasked with aiding Bond in the poker match. Mads makes for an ok villain as well. The action in this movie is top-notch. After the opening credits (featuring a solid Bond song), a chase scene draws attention immediately. The stunt team in Casino Royale deserves a lot of props for some of the actions they had to pull off. Also, the music is very solid throughout; the classic Bond theme isn't heard until the very end, signifying Bond's character arc into the mysterious 007 agent we're more familiar with. There are some little things I didn't care for in CR though. During another chase scene, there is a knife struggle in the middle of a crowded room, and, somehow, nobody notices. The movie feels long at 2 hours and 20 minutes, and that's thanks to the last 25 minutes or so. There's a twist towards the end that does nothing but serve as Bond's final transformation, and I feel like it could have been done in a way that didn't feel separate from the rest of the movie. Overall, Casino Royale will please new and old Bond fans alike while serving as a solid action movie. Go ahead and give it a watch if you have the 2+ hours! Final grade: B+ -Ben",positive
"I went to see this movie with no expectations whats or ever, and it blew me away. This movie proved Craig can make for a great Bond, and gave us a balls to the wall experience, without the corky JB moments and with more intriguing characters.",positive
"The second best of the Bond films behind Skyfall. Craig shows he is head and shoulders above brosnin. Royale has a great plot, actors and pacing. A little long but that's what you get from every 007 movie.",positive
"Yes! Bond is back and better than ever! They pretty much ruined Martin Campbell's great start on the bond character so they brought him back to kick start an even better Bond series. This took all the campiness of the earlier installments and got rid of it, no flashy CGI wave riding, no kills followed by one liners, just a super spy who kills who is supposed too, no matter what. Daniel Craig really delivers a strong performance, so goes the rest of cast. I found it weird that Judi Dench returned as M again, is it just Martin Campbell thought only she could do the role or something else? Fan theories! I've talked a lot about the cast and the director, the story is there, like boy is it there. It was incredible suspenseful and the dialogue is intelligent.",positive
"Not only this is the Best Bond Movie ever, it is a great movie on its own right. Great Script, acting, action scenes, and music. The characaters are very well developed. and feel like they are real people, with real problems, which is a big plus in a Bond Movie, altough i love bond, some of the movies in this franchise thend to get a little too cartoony. This movie also has The best Bond villain ever (La Chiffre), The best Bond girl ever (vesper Lynd), and probabbly the Best M ever... Great flick.",positive
"Daniel Craig's debut as 007 which he knocked out of the park. A very grounded, smart, realistic James Bond film. Casino Royale is debatably for most fans the best Bond film and I can honestly view this film as a movie of its own to be honest. Daniel Craig is the best bond since Sean Connery.",positive
My full opinion: 3.5/4,positive
"This is most likely the best Bond movie, due to the fact that it has some of the best action scenes of all time, David Arnold's best Bond score, terrific acting from Daniel Craig, Mads Mikkelsen, Jeffery Wright, Judi Dench and Eva Green, and a vulnerable hero and villain.",positive
top 5 bonds all time,positive
One of the best action movie of all time,positive
really great not a bad bond film.,positive
Excellent. This is one of my favourite Bond movies - a breath of fresh air into the franchise. I only wished the other ones after this one were as good.,positive
"a huge, somewhat overwhelming difference from Die another day, but so should any new rendition of Bond. The film is well made, and Craig gives us a new dark edge, much like Timothy Dalton beforehand in the series. However this film is overrated, Craig has no charm or wit and apart from a few scenes of pocket action their is little to no action save a casino game... Bond, although a 'newbie' in this reboot is as much of a sharphooting Bond as mr magoo. Some things are also unrealistic in this so called 'completley realistic' film. Too much correlation to the Bourne franchise",negative
"The Bond we deserve. Casino Royale opts for less frequent mindless action scenes in favour of more intimate, personal affairs, which ultimately places it higher than most of 007's enterprises.",positive
"Bond's best movie. Great action that wasn't dumb and over the top, characters that seemed real and the greatest Bond-girl to this day. Eva Green as Vesper stole the show. Le Chiffre is one of the greatest Bond-Villians of all time and the scar on his eye dosnt cover his whole face and have blood every where. (looking at you, Spectre!) It's everything I wanted and more.",positive
"First Bond film. Found Craig totally unlikable at first, but he (and the film overall) grew on me...",negative
"What a way to bring Bond back after the diabolical film that was Die Another Day. Bond is gritty, intense but still had that swagger that makes the character. Some fantastic action scenes early on especially a 10 minute parkour chase. The great thing about this film is that the best bits are the slower casino set scenes as the tension is built. My only criticism would be that at the beginning and end there are parts that feel that the film would be better without them (airport and country club scene), apart from this though it is definitely worth multiple viewings!",positive
One of my favorite bond movies of all time and that's saying something,positive
"Bond for the modern era, a masterpiece",positive
Seen this movie trillions of times!,positive
"James Bond: Casino Royale directed by Martin Campbell, is the perfect mix of action, sexy and story making this bond the best one yet. Daniel Craig gives a stunning performance.. Straight Flush ;)",positive
The greatest James Bond movie ever made.,positive
"didn't care for the story much but typical beautiful bond scenery, including a nude daniel craig.",negative
Casino Royale is a resurgence for the bond franchise. Defiantly one of the best films and Daniel Craig started with a great performance and an amazing first film for his Bond.,positive
"Not only it gives the darkness and dramatic depth we all wanted in a James Bond movie, but it delivers the best of the 007 series",positive
"Casino Royale is Daniel Craig's first James Bond film, and is Martin Campbell's second time that revived the James Bond franchise. People were very worried about Daniel Craig at first, but nowadays, people are excited to see him in the next film which makes sense as he is terrific in it and is a great replacement for Pierce Brosnan. Mads Mikkelsen is did a really good job as a villain, and Eva Green is great as a Bond girl while still having her own character that makes it stick out. The writing by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis is well written, and the action sequences are great and fun to watch. The movie doesn't necessarily focus on the action scenes and is mostly on the plot, which is really well done also. The characters are memorable and so is the villain, the poker scenes are intense to watch, even though I know nothing about poker. The movie takes some new risks that made this film stand out, and when I thought that the movie should've ended at the main plot and had no reason to keep going, well it actually had a reason which I'm glad that I found it unpredictable. It's smart, and the film sets it up for the sequel very cleverly, even if Quantum of Solace turn out to be a hateful film for the fans.",positive
"As far as I'm concerned this is the perfect Bond movie, a great theme, a more realistic, humanised villain and fantastic cinematography to name a few of the things that make this movie great. Craig debuts as Bond in spectacular fashion with a take on the character that had yet to be seen in the film universe and cemented himself as one of the best.",positive
daniel craig does what the previous five could not do for the James Bond franchise Brings in Humaness,positive
"The best Bond film in my opinion: well made, well written, and well acted. Daniel Craig is entertaining, believable, and likeable in the role, and the script is one of good pace, and good humour - the latter of which Craig delivers with applomb. I'm a big fan of Mads Mikkelsen, so in my eyes, he is a superb Bond villain, and the supporting characters are ones of intrigue and suspicion.",positive
One of the Best 007 to date.,positive
"Oh my God, this was the greatest! I loved it more than I ever thought I would. It was action-packed, smart, mysterious, intense, and surprisingly heartfelt. It was the greatest action I have ever seen, hands down. My only complaint was the end, I felt the budding romance was borderline corny and goofy, and it almost ruined the perfect score it had going. But it immediately made up for it with a strong ending that said ""Bond's back with a vengeance."" This film rocketed its way up to my all time favorite movies, and it will probably stay there for a long time.",positive
The best bond by a country mile!,positive
Some things are better left unwatched,negative
"The first installment in Craig's Bond franchise is a cause for celebration, this is the best James Bond movie in decades, and quite possibly, ever...",positive
"What I loved so much about this Bond film was the way it made Bond seem human. I watched Skyfall before this and honestly hated his character. After this story, though, I understand so much more of his motivation. Easily one of the best films I've seen this year. Action packed, emotional, and captivating.",positive
the greatest bond ever. with great action and verbal sparring. plus an emotional connection that comes alive.,positive
Best James Bond movie of all time!,positive
"Arguably the best James Bond film ever created. Daniel Craig is excellent as Bond. coupled with great action sequences, interesting plot, amazing script, and is beautifully shot and directed. One of my favourite films of all time.",positive
"Without a doubt, Casino Royale is the best Bond film. The sleek direction, thrilling story, and versatile performance from Daniel Craig make the film what fans were truly waiting for. This is how Bond became Bond, his first mission as a double-o agent and it is a darkly intense reinterpretation of the famed british spy.",positive
The Bond movie that makes me feel the smartest watching it. This is no doubt in competition as being the best in the series.,positive
"Casino Royale reinvents James Bond into a serious, realistic agent with a soul.",positive
My first experience with a Bond movie. As an Action movie it excels but it should've been at least half an hour shorter.,negative
Not enough Casino Royale....,negative
"At the peak of the Bond franchise, EON throws away the Bond formula, take's Fleming's book and adapts it to the rules of our post-911 society. It starts as an action film and leads into a drama. Craig re-energizes the role as a ruthless assassin, masculine lustbomb, romantic lover, and as a nascent 00, he's the first actor to portray a vulnerable Bond. Vesper is one of the best female leads in the franchise, Le Chiffre is an intimidating villain (in a different-than-usual) circumstance. Dench as M and Wright as Leiter round out the cast. The direction has a meticulousness which makes every scene great.",positive
"Back in 1953 the character of James Bond appeared when Ian Fleming got his novel ""Casino Royal"" published. This novel got significant amount of praise and manage to start one of the most successful franchise in the history of cinema and the world most famous spy. But after 4 decades, Eon Productions finally got the rights to adapt this novel and use it as the story that would launch a new era for Bond: The Daniel Craig era. Before becoming the iconic British spy, Bond had to earn his 00 status, and prove himself capable to take down any threat of the United Kingdom. If you have read some of my reviews (particularly my reviews of the whole Mission Impossible franchise), you know that I am a Bond fan, as I love those campy old films in my childhood. But after the ridiculous Pierce Brosnan era (culminating in ""Die Another Day"") and being the subject of multiple parodies (particularly ""Austin Powers"") the franchise needed a reboot, and what better time than the early 2000s when every franchise was rebooted in a new way to make it memorable and realistic, and ""Casino Royale"" is one of the perfect examples of how to reboot a franchise. ""Casino Royale"" counts with an intense story that serves as one of the most personal Bond stories ever put on film, Craig´s Bond is a fresh air into the franchise as he is confident in the role, it has undeniably the greatest Bond girl of the entire franchise, Mad Mikkelsen makes justice to one of Bond´s most iconic enemies, Martin Campell´s directing is confident and focused on the storytelling, the action scenes are spectacular, the cinematography is beautiful, the trademark opening credits and Bond song are among the best of the franchise, the chemistry between Craig and Green is incredible, the amount of detail is impressive, the romantic aspect of the film is genially believable and makes you wish that they don't follow the Bond girl cliché, the action sequences are wonderfully shot, and the screenplay plays with the expectations of us Bond fans or knowers of the franchise. While it is a little frustrating for a fan that it purposely lacks some Bond troupes (the henchmen, the supporting MI6 characters, some of Bond´s trademark lines, the standard gun barrel sequence, etc.), but at the same time it is more than justify and the finished result is nothing less than thrilling and unforgettable. ""Casino Royale"" is quite possibly the greatest reboot in the history of cinema (I even dare to say that it is a better reboot than ""Batman Begins"", another of my childhood heroes) and is arguably the greatest film of the franchise (it is tied with ""Goldfinger"" in my top Bond film). It is intense, personal, shocking, beautiful, classy and unforgettable. This proves that James Bond is the greatest spy represented in cinema.",positive
"Casino Royal. Bond, gambling. The first film in the series that isn't screaming for action and thrills still manages to be action packed. I absolutely love this film. It defines Bond for me especially considering this was the first ever Bond movie I've seen. The best thing about this film is that it focuses on nothing but growing Bond as a character. In the end, nothing is truly solved, there is still a higher power roaming free. Nevertheless, this adventure tested Bond more than ever before. He learned many lessons he probably hoped he would never learn. We get to see Bond in really emotional times of his life dealing with love, his career choice, and what it means to have a ""license to kill."" The script is extremely well written with some fantastic one-liners coming from Bond's lips. We can also feel the tensions as strongly as he does. What adds to this is the way the film is shot and directed. There is an intensity underlying every scene, even if the scene doesn't call for it. These shots also make Bond's kills more personal in their feel. This is not the same Bond as the one who formed its foundation, however, this is a Bond for the modern-times with all the same sleekness and suave looks he needs to carry that name.",positive
"Even though it's a little drawn out, Casino Royale is one of the best spy movies I've ever seen. Good acting, good action, and an interesting plot with a twist at the end.",positive
"I'm not really sure if this is a good James Bond film. Are James Bond films supposed to be authentically sad, romantic, and intense? Are James Bond films supposed to feature scenes that are carried almost entirely by subtle facial expressions, or scenes that are harrowing and disturbing? Is James Bond supposed to be a vulnerable and cynical human being? Are Bond girls supposed to be fully fleshed out complex characters? Lots of questions...",positive
perfect. whether you like bond or not this is a must see movie.,positive
This is a campy but riveting Bond that has not been matched in its charm and attraction.,positive
Andew guessed it was 2006.,positive
They don't get a whole lot better than this.,positive
"Also great action, but still too much womanizing.",negative
"Casino Royal has it all. Great plotting, tense action and well written characters. In addition the poker scenes are incredibly entertaining. The best of the Bond movies, right along with Skyfall.",positive
My favourite Bond (with Craig),positive
"Casino Royale introduces us to a whole new Bond, who is almost flawlessly developed throughout the movie. The best parts of the film are the characters and the action. The characters are written to avoid Bond stereotypes, which works very well. The action is filmed beautifully, especially the opening fight. The only flaw is the pacing, which is slow when it does not need to be.",positive
Not only the best James Bond film but one of the greatest action films of all time. This is an adrenaline rush from beginning to end. Casino Royale manages to make a card game thrilling thanks to a clever script and ace performances by Craig and Mikkelsen.,positive
"Casino Royale is one of the most tense, entertaining Bond films ever but an unfocused first act and excruciatingly long end hold it back from heartbeat. Grade: Bq",positive
Daniel Craig bursts into the scene as a devil may care 007 in his early days at MI:6. Action packed and sexy as expected for a film in this series. 11/8/15 - Home,positive
"To re-energize the Bond series, they bring in the amazing Daniel Craig and they calm down with the usual Bond tropes like the over-the-top action sequences, the over-the-top villain and Bond always getting the girl. This story is a lot more realistic and believable than the last two, which shouldn't take the viewer out of the movie.",positive
"I may be alone here, but I think this is the greatest film ever made.",positive
This is a great movie,positive
93/100 - Top 3 bonds of MY lifetime,positive
Casino Royale throws away the camp in favor of a dark and character driven Bond story. Daniel Craig fills the shoes of a younger James with a mixture of my two previous bond favs (Connery and Dalton). A powerful origin story that shows that even aged stories can be reinvented.,positive
"yes it is entertaining and the romantic plot is quite good, but I think Daniel Craig changes the character too radically into a brute, totally lacking the elegance of former Bonds, and especially he is miles away from the sprezzatura of Sean Connery.Too overtly cold and artificially muscular to be attractive. I much preferred the unsentimental humor of the classic 007.",negative
"Casino Royale is one of the best, if not the best bond film to date.",positive
One of the best action and spy movies of all time,positive
A great story with one of the best portrayals of the character ever.,positive
"It's well documented how much I don't like the Brosnan films but we got a new Bond because of the lack of quality in those films. That new Bond being Daniel Craig. Since this film, Casino Royale, was the first Bond film I ever saw, it has a special place in my love of Bond, and films in general. But it's not just that it was my first Bond, Casino Royale is a great film no matter what. As a new Bond usually does, Casino Royale reinvented the formulaic nature of this series. This all starts by giving Bond one of if not the best female leads of all time. Eva Green may be the first ever Bond woman of the series as she exemplifies pure strength in her vulnerability. She is not a damsel in distress and she is in no way the usual eye candy or sex object that the series can sometimes rely upon. Her chemistry with Craig is undeniable as is her likability as the stunning and seductive Vesper Lynd. It's the longest Bond film upon its release which is noticable, but it's also used to the film's advantage. There are plenty of twists and turns to go along with some of the series' best action sequences to date. Right from the opening pre-credits to the thrilling climatic sscene, Casino Royale blends the best of what modern day CGI and effects have to offer while also showing tribute to the best of what the series offered so far. Mads Mikkelsen plays Le Chiffre, a quietly manipulating investor for terrorists. The first half of the film is non-stop action packed as 007 goes after Chiffre, but it really picks up once Green and Mikkelsen come into play. Casino Royale is in many ways an origin story for Bond. We begin the film with him just being promoted to '007' status. He's careless and very much egotistical throughout the film. But he shows the beginnings to the Bond we love. We don't even here the classic Bond theme until the very end of the film, but everything really comes together perfectly for this movie. I think it may be my favorite of the series because it doesn't rely on the beautiful girls and action sequences to tell a great story. Both of those aspects are very present, but they don't overpower just how great the story and writing are. But I think the thing I appreciate the most about the film is that it treats the audience intelligently unlike the few films before it. +Origin story +Eva Green is fantastic +High powered action +Mixed with a twisted and intelligent plot +Mikkelsen +Not formulaic 9.6/10",positive

"A sweeping, riveting, tour de force. Witty dialogue, including the complicated relationship between Vespa and Bond, are a highlight. Add in suitably unhealthy doses of action, parcour, car chases and, shake - not stir. Daniel Craig delivers a gritty, dark and uncompromising Bond, matched by Eva Green's smouldering, sensual, complex performance. The strength of Vespa is a standout, particularly when compared to the hollow charactures of previous incarnations. One of the best ever Bond movies!",positive
"Not only the greatest bond film, easily, of all time, but one of the top 3 action films ever. Glorious set pieces with practical effects and master stunt work, an epic, sprawling story that centers around a game of poker...and isn't that refreshing after the wish wash Brosnan and co had brought to the series. Daniel Craig brings humanity, depth, subtle humor and incredible physical acting to the role and simply makes it indisputable about who is the best bond ever. An absolute timeless masterpiece, strengthened by the presence of Eva Green as Bond's one and only love. ""Would you like that shaken or stirred sir?"" ""Do I look like I give a damn?""",positive
"One, If not the best bond movie ever, I Highly Recommend it.",positive
"Fun, thrilling and action packed! Just an awesome movie!",positive
"Never got into Dalton or Brosnan as Bond. This is a brilliant relaunch of the franchise. It has all the ingredients of a successful Bond flick. Craig is excellently cast as 007, Mikkelsen is a quality villain and Green is a smoking hot Bond girl. The intro is solid, the poison scene is tense and that torture scene is subjective yet horrific. That final scene is killer aswell. Bond is fucking back.",positive
"Brought me back to Bond. I'd given up interest in the series - it was always on the silly side, but this reinvention was about as perfect as one could hope - both for a Bond flick or an action picture in general. Highly recommended.",positive
"A simply brilliant film. One of the best Bond films ever, which is saying a lot",positive
"Bond is now more of a human being ... emotions and flaws included. Craig is a decent enough Bond but I could never get that into the Bond series as a whole and while this is a cool reinvention ... something still just doesn't do it for me. I like the story, the acting, and there are some great action set pieces. We lost all of the gadgets and cheesy moments of the past few Bonds so this is definitely a more serious back to basics bond. With that said I am in the minority ... most feel like this is one of the best bond movies ever made.",positive
It's great to see a Bond film actually worth watching. Vesper Lynd: The best Bond girl of all time.,positive
"A brilliant spy film that serves as an incredible bond adventure and an amazing action picture. The cast is great, the action is spectacular, and the writing is great. The film has many intense and incredible action sequences but also many moments of just great dialogue and great tension between the characters. This is a must see action/spy thriller and the best in the genre in years.",positive
It's the best movie ever move to 100%,positive
"The lauded film that was supposed to relaunch the Bond franchise, with perpetually pouting baby Bond blond replacing elder statesman Brosnan. Eva Green is absolutely detestable, the ending is both soppy and anticlimactic, Jeffrey Wright's talents are completely wasted here (and *spoiler alert* in the sequel), as are those of ""The Rag"" (french translation of ""Le Chiffre"" I kid you not) himself Mads Mikkelsen, and all of this over a high stakes card game in Sarajevo. Granted, Bond's gadgets over the year can border on kitschy, and past action and dialogue have been campy, but this is just a plain snoozefest.",negative
If only all James Bond movies were like this!!,positive
Best Bond movie by far!,positive

"Rebooting the 47 year James Bond franchise with Ian Flemings´first adventure, the new interpretation of our hero was a complete rejuvenation to say the least.´Light years apart from all the 20 earlier 007 films, Casino Royale took the lead as the best as at year 2007. Stripped of corny CGIs, the stunt actions were amazingly heart stopping. Unlike his predecessors, Daniel Craig is one Bond with more substance, agility,stamina, brains and pain tolerance. His chemistry with Judi Dench (M) was magic. It was clearly obvious, she commanded respect from 007. Very few do. Otherwise his arrogance and punch lines injected superb humour. Brilliant action film with probably the best James Bond ever. Strong, intelligent, gutsy and strikes fear in people with his piercing blue eyes.. Never a dull moment in this nearly 2.5 hours long film Very gritty and painful to watch at times. One thinks James Bond has a very high thresh hold for pain. Nice to see James Bond has his spell of domesticity and inebriation with love. Although it did end tragically and explained his flippant desire of one night stands with future female encounters (save for Her Majesty Service where he met his next tragic love story). If you had paid attention, you would also have learnt the recipe to James Bond´s signature cocktail, the vodka martini. Why it should be drunk shaken and not stirred remains to be discovered.",positive
One of the best bonds ever. Daniel Craig is great and he renews the James Bond franchise.,positive
This is my favorite bond movie of all time. Best action scenes by far and the most believable action bond. And the plot is great with the action in support.,positive
Best Bond flick ever!,positive
"An entertaining protagonist and a slick sense of style and tone drive Casino Royale. While it sometimes comes off as remarkably subdued compared to more recent action movies, the action is always visceral and intense, and the writing intelligent. At times it feels a bit slow and unrelatable, losing some punch to watch Bond smirk some more. Which, while often fun, detracts from the overall shine of the film.",negative
"Non-stop action with amazing stunts mixed with some great & often funny performances by the cast. This being my first Bond film, I loved it.",positive
Best Bond and Bond Film so far!,positive
"My favorite James Bond movie. In this movie, his character traits actually move the plot forward. Gambling, drinking, seducing women, and dressing fancy all plays a big part in the plot. I love this movie because the focus is mostly on the poker game. Even then, some of the action is great and the first big action sequence where he's chasing the bomb maker is very exciting. One of the best Bond movies.",positive
"I've been a huge James Bond fan since Dr. No in the 1960's. Sean Connery was the only real James Bond, in spite of decades of tongue-in-cheek silliness of Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan and the others. But when Daniel Craig came along, suddenly there was a real James Bond. And as blasphemous as it sounds, he's the greatest James Bond ever. Casino Royale was the beginning of a rebirth of the James Bond franchise with truly remarkable and excellent films. This is what James Bond should have been for the last decades. There is no better spy film than the current James Bond franchise. Amen. My only quibble with this film is casting Eva Green as Vesper Lynd. I dunno, she seems fairly average and not very interesting. Hard to understand what Bond sees in her. On the other hand, Caterina Murino gets my vote for possibly the best Bond girl in the entire franchise. I've never been real impressed with the Bond girls, but this girl is the right combination of stunningly sexy and gorgeous, playfully naughty, and someone who can glance at you and make your knees buckle. Someone worthy of James Bond.",positive
"Great, but not as good as Skyfall",positive
"Non-stop action with amazing stunts mixed with some great & often funny performances by the cast. This being my first Bond film, I loved it.",positive
One of the best of the bond films and a great movie of the 2000's,positive
"It took me over five years to rewatch this movie, and I honestly don't know what took me so long. From beginning to end, I was mesmerised by the explosive action scenes, tense poker sequences, and Daniel Craig's subtle-yet-excellent performance as 007. This movie brought to the Bond franchise what it had been missing for years: a human Bond. Not a campy super-spy, killing machine; a grounded, fresh take on the iconic character. This film also gave us an iconic, very solid villain. The best villains are those who we as the audience can understand. We were able to believe that Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre would go to any extreme necessary because his life was on the line. He wasn't doing these things simply to toy with people, or because he's just inherently evil. If he didn't get the money, he would be assassinated. This gave Bond a solid rival, one who would go to great length to oppose him. Not because he wanted to, but because he had to. Eva Green was a spectacular choice for the role of Vesper Lynd. She manages to not only capture Bond's heart, but the audience's as well. And [no spoilers, although the film is almost 10 years old] the twist at the end of the film works really well, and is surprisingly believable. The movie is just overall a really intense thrill ride, but it doesn't simply rely of heart-pounding action in order to maintain its intensity. It often finds it in the most intriguing of places. The poker scenes are some of the most tense in the film. Casino Royale was a brilliant, realistic take on the Bond character and left audiences (myself included) salivating for future installments.",positive
Good way to reboot Bond.,positive
"I'm probably the only person on this planet, who would rank this movie on their Top 10 movies ever-list. It's freaking perfect!!",positive
"Casino Royale is a fantastic re-imagining of the bond franchise completely reviving it bringing more class and sophistication to the table. Daniel Craig is an epitome of that, taking James Bonds character forward with a more raw personality that is honest, arrogant and genuine. The story itself is suspenseful with its own twists and turns and has all that you expect from a traditional bond movie yet feeling completely fresh with less tacky gadgetry and more intelligence. The woman in bonds arm is this time a story of love and lost, a source for all anger and direction for the movies to come in the franchise. Overall its a fantastic watch, one you have to be in the mood to watch compared to the 007 of old which is more of a popcorn flick, a bold move in the right direction.",positive
"007 reboot starring Daniel Craig. Portraying a young, cold & raw Bond, this feature takes you back to the beginning with twists & turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. One of the best to date.",positive
Best movie I've ever seen!,positive
One unique Bond who surprises us with his appeal and charismatic arrogance adding up a one of a kind Bond girl which will never be just a Bond girl.,positive
"A soft reboot of the franchise, Casino Royale opens with Bond notching his first two kills to earn double-zero status. His body count rapidly accelerates to an impressive number, considering most of the film revolves around a game of cards. Casino also earned an impressive number at the box office as the highest-grossing Bond film to that point. The Daniel Craig movies bring Bond into the 21st century with a bang, leaning far more heavily on traditional gritty action and drama than on the hokey gadgets and superweapons that the franchise was known for. Instead of the Cold War crazies, the filmâ(TM)s baddie is motivated purely by money. Mads Mikkelsen is tremendous as Le Chiffre, a banker for many of the worldâ(TM)s terrorist organizations. After gambling away his clientsâ(TM) funds on a failed stock market manipulation plot, he arranges a high-stakes poker game to try and cover his tracks. Royale is guilty of some of the insanely overly choreographed nonsense that befalls many modern movies. As if someone legitimately trying to get away would scale a crane and try to navigate their way through the steel beam skeleton of a skyscraper under construction, rather than simply disappearing into the street crowds. Itâ(TM)s hard to fault it, however, as thatâ(TM)s exactly the kind of over the top action that the Bond movies are famous for, and its fans have come to expect the fantastic. The score is perfect throughout. It builds consistently throughout the airport scene. Itâ(TM)s wondrous, hopeful, and adventurous in the all the right moments. David Arnold deserved an Oscar nod for his work. The late Chris Cornell provided a quality title track. Eva Green shares remarkable chemistry with Craig and gives a splendid performance as Vesper Lynd, the Treasury agent supervising Bondâ(TM)s purse strings at the casino and one of the best-written Bond girls to date. Craig is perfect as Bond, even if the script prevents him from being remarkable. The strong silent type is a hard character to earn any accolades for portraying, but the newest Bond does all he can be expected to do. Heâ(TM)s confident, suave, and ruggedly handsome. Easily the most badass of all the Bonds, his writers are unfortunately lacking in the humorous one-liner department. The writing team of Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade lays the groundwork for an excellent saga to come and Campbell would make a welcome director in future installments. Overall, Casino is everything a spy movie aught to be.",positive
"Rating: 77% It pales in comparison to Bourne and M:I, but Casino Royale still gets out immensely entertaining action, a gritty story, and a refreshing take on James Bond thanks to Daniel Craig.",positive
"One recent viewing on DVD. Spoilers throughout. Rating: Fierce I am happy to finally see this first Daniel Craig bond movie. I was underwhelmed with both Quantum of Solace and Skyfall, but now I understand the hype for Daniel Craig. This serves as an insightful and thrilling origin to James Bond. From the first scene this film is on point with keeping the pace and action enticing. Moving through the locations and different feeling you get with each set piece keep everything fresh. You have classic chases, gun fights, and torture scenes in spy movies, but the downtime in between is also engaging, particularly the poker game. It's hard to think of a movie in 2006 being dated but the height of Texas Hold Em' clearly influenced this film. However that just increases the buy in to the suspense. You do not see what is coming, ever. I loved how this movie is clearly a learning curve for James Bond to become a world class spy, teaching that he can't just skirt by with his charm and get all the perks without making sacrifices. Speaking of which the relationship between Daniel Craig's Bond and Eva Green's Vesper is electric. The chemistry is apparent from the first interaction, and they only increase the magnetism as the situation gets more complicated. The climax of the film leaves the relationship undefined, and her death scene underwater is heart breaking. You feel the anger and desperation in Craig's face, and by the end his demeanor clearly shows someone who has felt substantial loss. The stoic, bad ass character of James Bond is born with his iconic line to end on the highest note. Some other positives are the very Bond-like villain in Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre, Judi Dench as M, the subtle Bond gadgets/car, and gorgeous look overall. Some nit picks is that since the movie is longer some of the beginning scenes felt less connected, even when they were a pleasure to experience.",positive
A great start for Daniel Craig's Bond career that delivered intense and engaging scenes both with action and not. Great chases that had creative obstacles in the environment. My only low is the villain witch lacked character witch I believe is what makes the best Bond villains.,positive

"Not only the best bond movie ever made, 'Casino Royale' is one of the best action movies ever made and one of my personal top 5 favorite films. Absolutely a must watch, subverts bond cliches at every turn, and features the ONLY strong bond female character in the history of the series. Daniel Craig is goat",positive
Absolutely brilliant.,positive
"Intense and studded with amazing action sequences, Casino Royale is truly fantastic for both casual moviegoers and fans of the franchise. Full Review: With all the CG going about, it was clear James Bond would need to have a revamp of action - and Casino Royale does just that. Of course the plot has holes and it doesn't have the greatest development, but the movie clearly has a focus on action. Between hanging on to construction cranes and exploding cars the action is over the top but immensely engaging and entertaining. The narrative follows a straightforward continuity that allows for raw, intense action.",positive
"Best James Bond movie ever. Very cool acting by Daniel Craig, much more serious and less over-the-top.",positive
"James Bond is back and more smart stylish and sexy. And this time he has to play a poker game to take back his money that criminal mastermind ""Matthias"" stole from him. Yep he's back and gets shot at more than usual. I saw this with my brother in my room. And Bond might not be as wise as the Mission Impossible Movies are but still amazing. And the woman died! Yay! Seriously I didn't like her all that much. And once again this is more smart, stylish, and modern than the others. And has a lot more action to add also. It may leave you confused and bored at times but is one of the best bond movies in my book. 92% B+",positive

"A much different way to give bond, in a really good way. Eye-popping action sequences, a worthy villain, and a hilarious torture scene. Casino Royale has a new bond played by Daniel Craig and is now in my opinion the best Bond in the franchises history.",positive
My favorite film of all time,positive
"One simple, elegant revival of the Bond series filled with constant thrills and high levels of intensity.",positive
"My favorite movie of all time!! It is incredible, and action- packed. This is classic Bond. I am a huge fan of the James Bond franchise, I have seen them all but this, OHMSS, and Thunderball standout to me. Casino Royale especially! Sitback, relax, and showtime! Enjoy the thrills!!",positive
"Daniel Craig resurrects a dying franchise with a charismatic, violent and suave rendition that will go down in film lore. Crag immediately takes command of the role and drives a complex narrative that intertwines trust, betrayal, self-discovery, love and the dark world of espionage. Easily the best Bond movie in the franchise's history (with Craig also being the best Bond).",positive
Bond is brought back to classic formula and style with this witty and intense film that clearly establishes Daniel Craig as the Best Bond since Connery.,positive
"D. Craig makes an powerful debut as a fresh, vibrant Bond in one of the best films to date.",positive
"Der Neu Anfang der James Bond Franchise ist sehr gut gelungen! Ich gebe es zu, als Daniel Craig als neuer Bond vorgestellt wurde, war ich auch sehr skteptisch. Aber man hat ihn noch nicht spielen sehen als Geheimagent. Also hat man ihm auch eine Chance gegeben. Es ist eine positive Überraschung, was Craig aus seiner Rolle gemacht hat. James Bond ist ein richtiges Greenhorn geworden. Sicherlich ist er härter und kompromissloser als seine Vorgänger. Er ist aber auch verletzlicher geworden. Gut gemachter und bodenständiger Agententhriller mit urbanen Actionsequenzen ohne grosse technische Spielereien. Der Neu Anfang der Reihe ist gefestigt und man ist grosser Erwartungen, wie es mit James Bond weitergeht! Fazit: Solide und klassisch, dass Lust auf mehr macht!",positive
Best Bond movie ever. So far.,positive
"Really cool...lots of action, suspense, and surprises. The villain was perfect for Bond, and so was Daniel Craig.",positive
"It's a James Bond film. James Bond does James Bond stuff. It's entertaining, but not excellent.",negative
"A standout among the numerous Bond films (to say the least) deliciously entertaining, beautifully filmed, powerfully acted, and bringing Bond into darker and more thought provoking dilemmas than excepted Casino Royale isn't just a great Bond film. It's a great film period. 4.5/5 Amazing.",positive
"Every actor that has played Bond over the years brings something different to the table. Daniel Craig brings a toughness and grittiness to 007. I was a little skeptical about Craig playing Bond at first because he was a ""blonde Bond."" I can't believe I waited so long to see this film and Daniel Craig is by far one of the best of all the Bonds. This is the darkest of the Bond franchise and it's also one of the best. Eva Green is one of the most beloved Bond girls in the history of the franchise.",positive
Awesome start to the Daniel Craig era!,positive

"This is, by far, the worst Bond movie ever. No naked girls in the title sequence. Bond get beaten up by nearly everyone. No one, other than Felix Liter is genuine or can be trusted. He falls in love with a girl who takes hime for everything he's got! Hey, I get that without going to the movies. The biggest scene is a card game -- in a 007 movie. Really? Horrbible waste of my time. Now I'm having nightmares thinking of his privates getting whacked. This is not James Bond. My thought is that someone out there is trying to make all our heroes look bad. Oh, and there were no special gadgets, AND 007 did not escape when the Bad Guys cought hime -- a first. Disgusting. Extremely poor movie. I gave it 2stars for the Bond music.",negative
MartÃ­n Campbell knows how to end a movie,positive
"I've watched this movie after watching the sequel Skyfall. Skyfall was tenious in my opinion and most importantly, not enough action scenes. While Casino Royale completes your day with satisfying dramatic scenes! Great and interesting dialogue from Daniel and Eva! The chemistry between them is loveable! Last, I don't know anything about poker (and the irony of that is that I live in Vegas) and the poker scenes were the best pieces of this movie!",negative
"Casino Royale is an amazing combination of everything intense, everything stylish... Well simply put... Everything Bond. And it's a great combination. Like... Really great.",positive
"Entertaining, Dramatic and with wonderful action scenes Daniel Craig breathes fresh air into the James Bond franchise.",positive
"The best thing about the Bond franchise is reboots don't exist. They pass the torch and move on, however. With Daniel Craig came a whole new level of Bond in a much different world then depicted in the other 20 films. Craig brings the books to life by being brutal, suave, and charming. This is the Bond fans have waited for, but that isn't to say the others were hacks as they weren't. In this particular film you'll find a great origin story. Before he was double o status and just when he became what we know as 007. Craig again is Brutal in the part and shows no mercy as a young Bond wouldn't. By the time the last scene of the movie roles around and he says the name's ""Bond, James Bond"" you'll believe it.",positive
A little long but amongst the next Bond films.,positive
"Arguably the greatest Bond movie in my book. They made Bond a gritty, violent, and realistic version of the character that could exist in the modern world and stand next to the likes of Jason Bourne and have people say that James Bond is not only cool again, but that he's badass. Very, very well done action movie that entertains from beginning to end.",positive
This is to the first part to the Jame bound reboot series. It a great movie. Quantum of solace is better. This movie has a great story line. And great acting. It also has great special effects.,positive
"When Bond becomes Bond. Daniel Craig starts and finishes this movie as being the best Bond thus far. Even better than Connery, big shoes filled well. Director Martin Campbell is back for his second outing in the Bond franchise and introduces two vastly different actors both gifted with the ability to play the worlds greatest spy. This movie set a new gold standard for Bond, he isn't just about sleeping around and cheesy (but fun) jokes anymore. I personally love all the Bond films and I like all the actors but Craig comes in daringly. From the opening bathroom fight sequence to the ending torture scene he keeps things fresh and bold. And by the time he says Bond, James Bond. He means it and you'll know.",positive
"This movie brings new life to the Bond franchise and has started to make a James Bond for the 21st century. Daniel Craig is magnificent as Bond after many people doubted him simply because he's blonde. Mads Mikkelsen is great as the villain, sadistic and troubled, by far one of Bond's best villains. 'Casino Royale' is thrilling, action packed and tense, it's one of the best.",positive
"Daniel Craig is GREAT in this movie, Directed very well acted brilliantly by Daniel Craig and Eva Green and the poker scene is very suspenseful",positive
Suspenseful and a kickass movie,positive
"With the severely disappointing Die Another Day, I thought the Bond films had fallen into the same trap that Batman did. I thought Daniel Craig was a bad idea until I read about Ian Flemming's original James Bond. Daniel Craig fits the character. A fantastic re-boot of James Bond is what we all needed, and that is what we got. Him, a fresh out of the box 00 agent, Bond has the drive to do anything to complete a mission. Previous films portrayed Bond as sex first then mission second. The absolutely stunning Eva Green just takes my breath away. The filming is superb, story is great, and the pace is kept up. Showing that Bond is sentimental and caring gives depth to the character and we can root for him because he is a decent guy, not just because. If you wish to see Bond in all of Ian Flemming's glory, this is the film to start with. The others are somewhat campy and dated now.",positive

"I actually really enjoyed this. Hmmm, maybe these Bond films aren't so bad.",positive
"""Casino Royale"" is part of the incredibly large Jame Bond--007--franchise, serving as a vehicle for Daniel Craig to take the wheel on the driver's seat. Is it any good? Other than the fact that I bought my copy for 2 bucks, oh, absolutely! Granted, I haven't seen many of the James bond films, but ""Casino Royale"" does what it sets out to do. Whether it's to establish Craig's Bond for later installments or feed off the success of the previous entries--no matter how you look at it,""Casino Royale"" works. It's full of great action, suspense, and sly humor; Craig might not look like fits the role of James Bond on the surface. But let me tell you, when the iconic theme starts playing near the end, and Craig says that one famous line. That's it, he's proved himself, and all doubt is erased. It's interesting because after I watched ""Skyfall""--back when the hype around it was at its height and having never had seen Craig act as 007--I had a bit of trouble identifying with him as the character. And, had I seen ""Casino Royale"" when it was out in theaters, my opinion of the Craig-era Bond movies might have been different. I know, for a fact, that I didn't like ""Quantum of Solace"" that much despite its wickedly awesome title [and 'Quantum' is a short movie compared to 'Casino' and 'Sky.']. So now I kind of want to revisit ""Skyfall"" before the upcoming ""Spectre"" is on the big screen.",positive
"Predictable, boring, and generic.",negative
Daniel Craig is given a hell of a story to shape his Bond in and he nails it. Full review later.,positive
THE BEST BOND THEME SONG!!,positive
"La mejor de las ultimas entregas de James Bond , que bella es Eva Green.",positive
"a gritty, hard-boiled incarnation of bond necessitates sacrificing the past entries' high-spirited zaniness. yet it pays off rather sensationally, nestling itself as a perceptive action-thriller unearthing 007's motives and cold demeanour. craig lacks charm but fits into the part like a second skin. overall, 'casino royale' makes challenging and penetrating cogitation the order of the day.",negative

MY FIRST BOND MOVIE!!!!!!!!! So classy and such a wonderful action flick.. That is all. So exciting. Ugh. Daniel Craig.,positive
Really glad I finally saw this. This was pretty good. Loved the story. It kept me interested. Who does love watching Bond playing Poker? At first I wasn't to crazy about the idea of Daniel Craig playing Bond but he really worked. There were some parts of the film that I wasn't too crazy about but I thought this was a nice introduction to Daniel Craig. :),negative
"It was a good comeback indefinitely. Craig pulls of a modern age Bond, especially during the poker game. The lack of 'Bond' music (until the end) is a shame.",positive
"The best action movie i ever saw, 144 minutes but you don't feel because is interesting, this movie catch you and don't leave you before the end. 9.5/10",positive
A really good James Bond film. A great reboot.,positive
"After the over the top Pierce Brosnan days of James Bond, Warner Bros. wanted to for some reason reboot 007. So they casted the newest Bond to be: Daniel Craig, and obvious backlash on Daniel Craig as 007 at the time of 2005 for the upcoming film came. But soon after, everyone realized how much of an ass they were as the release of Casino Royale came that not only brought in a great story, many well made action-packed sequences and fights, a romance that did great for a BOND FILM, a very realistic and intensive tone, but also gave Daniel Craig a performance of James Bond's recent reinvention all fans have waited for: A caustic, intense, funny, and deeply haunted 007 that can ACTUALLY be a human for once (not to diss people like Sean Connery or Brosnan.)",positive
"I've seen this movie about five times. I still don't understand a little bit of it, but I get more into it when I watch it again.",positive
"Casino Royale is a great James Bond flick. The pacing is excellent, never is there a really dull moment. The action is gorgeously shot. Daniel Craig gives a great performance as James Bond, and Vesper, played by Eva Green, is an interesting Bond girl. Towards the end, the movie did seem to drag on a bit, but it didn't make the movie any worse.",positive
Loved this movie and it was a great introduction for Craig to portray Bond. The story never bored and entertained till the end. 5/5,positive
"Remarkable!! The characters, the action, the acting, the plot! It ain't over 'til it's over, baby!",positive
"'Casino Royal' is the definitive Bond film. Daniel Craig's performances as 007 is relatable, thrilling, and genius. This is not only the best Bond film, but just an overall great film period.",positive
"After 20 great or pretty good entries in the franchise, we finally received the James Bond we deserve in Daniel Craig. Along with him comes a depth of character and emotion previously unseen. In Eva Green's Vesper Lynd is the reason why Bond became the man he did. The dialogue between the two is exquisite and the chemistry is blistering. Less obvious but equally impactful is the reforging of Bond for the female gaze, while retaining the Bond Girl aesthetic, with modern updates to give the women more agency. There are two fantastic villains in both Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre and Jesper Christensen as Mr. White, an incredible supporting cast, an incredible sense of wit, relentless and breathtaking action, and a sharp, tense plot. Casino Royale is not just the best Bond movie ever made, but one of my favorite movies of all time.",positive
"Probably my favorite bond movie. At leaves out all the gadgets and focuses on the characters, which are all great. Bond, Vesper, Le Chiffre, Mr. White, the CIA Agent even the silly swiss bank guy is awesome.",positive
A perfect action film. Unbelievably deft in its execution.,positive
The best bond ever made.,positive
"Even though this film dispenses with many of the characteristic traits of the Bond films it's a great, muscular, adventurous, brutal, and very creative action film. The locales are exotic, the Bond girls beautiful, Daniel Craig is a relevant and important Bond, and the production values are fantastic. The film manages to include most of what made the early Bond films great while updating it for today's audiences with much different expectations. This is one of the best Bond films because it sticks with tradition without falling victim to the desire to slavishly imitate past successes, allowing creativity and imagination to breath new life into the franchise.",positive
"Casino Royale is the Bond film we've all been waiting for: a much darker, intense, and smarter thriller with a stellar performance by Daniel Craig.",positive
"Probably my favorite movie of all time, and hands down the best James Bond of the entire franchise. I never grow tired of this one.",positive
"Vesper Lynd: Am I going to have a problem with you, Mr. Bond??... James Bond: No, don't worry, you're not my type. Vesper Lynd: Smart? James Bond: Single. only one man can kill 10 guys with all his wits and sophistication intact...brilliantly plotted and superbly supported by the whole cast...my first 007 movie and simply fell in love with Daniel Craig's character....well to sum it up if you haven't seen a bond movie yet like me , all i would say is - there are some super heroes(the unreal ,fantasy ones) and then there's one being a super human!! (Y)",positive
Good Bond flick at best. Daniel Craig definitely proves he has what it takes to fill in the shoes of the one only Bond. James Bond,negative
No doubt this is one of the best Bond movies of all time. Martin Campbell re-invents the Bond franchise creating a more gritty and realistic bond which is beautifully portrayed by Daniel Craig.,positive
"Hmm, seen it before in my college History of European Motion Picture class (ugh such a great class), but I don't remember much as it was a while ago. I'm assuming it was good. Haha",negative
"I liked the film a lot however it felt too Bourney for me at the time, (not a bad thing, it needed to go down that route to reinvent the franchise) I do need to give this another watch and Being a bond fanboy, loved the performances, the action top notch, And Daniel Craig impressed me",positive
"Daniel Craig, the ultimate badass at breathing new life into James Bond!",positive
"the villain isn't exactly menacing, and it suffers from the same thing the lost world did; there was a pointless fourth act at the end that just completely destroyed the movie",negative
this is probably one of the best Bond films with great action and Bond is very realistic espcialy in the toucher scene,positive
"Casino Royale is silent, smart and attractive. Craig's charisma gives Bond a new look with its serious but gorgeous Bond. The film is genius and action packed thinking this is maybe the Bond that everybody was satisfied and been waited for decades for its new restoration. A top on its list.",positive
The Best Bond movie of all time !,positive
"An intense, emotionally riveting film, with just enough action to keep you in it, Casino Royale is in my opinion, the best Bond film ever.",positive

I've never had an interest in Bond films...this film changed that,positive
OMG THIS MOVIE IS SO RAW!!!!!,positive
"Dark, gritty, and tense, Casino Royale is the Batman Begins of 007.",positive
"Smart and action packed. Not sure Craig completely fits the bill of the smooth handsome 007, but he remains true to Bond's witty and confident nature. The pacing of the film is exactly what a Bond movie should be.",positive
"A great Bond movie. ""Casino Royale"" is well-acted, suspenseful and gripping. Daniel Craig was perfect as James Bond, Eva Green did great; Bond fans will have much to talk about.",positive
"(69%) This really is Bond going back to basics. The stupid sci-fi gadgets, the over-the-top and all too apparent CGI riddled action set-pieces, comedy side characters and strait from a children's cartoon bad guys of ""Die another day"" and many like it are all absent. And from the beginning this takes itself very seriously, although maybe a bit too seriously, but I guess the main aim was to remove itself from the last couple of Brosnan movies as much as possible and start over again. There's certainly romantic plot elements lifted from ""The spy who loved me"" and ""On her majesty's secret service"", which is a fine asset to have. And Eva Green is a perfect inclusion to the Bond universe, while the action is hard hitting and has real weight behind it as Bond gets badly hurt more in this than any other entry. If this just had a touch of humour, which is an important element to any Bond flick, then this would be one of my favourites, but it's still very good.",negative
This film is nearly 10 years old and I still love it.,positive
the best bond film I've seen.,positive
Another great James Bond movie!! Love 007. He's the best crime killer ever. Daniel Craig is the best James Bond ever made!!! Awesome and in the casino.,positive

"Director Martin Campbell's second attempt at a James Bond film is a vast improvement on his first - the Pierce Brosnan-helmed ""GoldenEye"" - and is a worthy introduction to the new Daniel Craig era of James Bond. When his first mission as a 00 agent fails to go to plan, Bond goes rogue to try and track down the source of a terrorist syndicate. After spending some time in the Bahamas, Bond learns that banker Le Chiffre is heavily involved, and MI6 task Bond with going undercover in a major poker tournament in Montenegro to try and track down Le Chiffre's sources. Working with Treasury employee Vesper Lynd, Bond battles assassins, thugs and a game of cards to try and unravel the syndicate. Starring Craig in his first appearance as Bond, the film also stars Eva Green and Mads Mikkelsen, and retains Judi Dench in her role as ""M"", the leader of MI6. Craig in particular is very good, nailing the dry humour and suave demeanor of the super spy, combined with a stripped back vulnerability that past Bonds have never explored. Additionally, Green and Mikkelsen make a great Bond girl and Bond villian respectively. It's tense, dark and funny simultaneously, and set a new blueprint for what 007 should be in the modern age of cinema.",positive
"Casino Royale was the 21st film in the ever-popular James Bond anthology starring a brand new Bond in Daniel Craig, Eva Green as Bond-Girl Vesper Lynd, Dame Judi Dench as M and the ever dead-eyed Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre. Casino Royale can only be described as a high-stakes gambling thriller where Bond is forced to play a ludicrously big poker game in order to defeat a master weapons dealer. Casino Royale was Daniel Craig's first go at being 007 and the movie goes with that theme, this essentially being an origin story as to how Bond becomes a 00 agent. It starts off with a beautifully constructed black and white scene which goes to show the style that this new Bond undertakes during his missions. But right after the gorgeous opening theme, the film cuts to an action scene with Bond tearing Africa apart and shows his naivety as a special agent and how much he still has to learn to become the agent that he is in that opening shot. And on cue, Bond gets called out by M about it. This beginning to a ""new"" Bond really sets the tone for the movie as Bond now has to deal with overcoming his childishness and put away his ego if he wants to prove himself as a 00 agent. Intertwined with this theme of becoming a mature 00, Bond has to now delve deeper into the mission that involves essentially defeating the supposed villain Le Chiffre in a very high stakes Poker game. There's never any time for Bond to be just sitting idly, and in the midst of the entire poker game (which has to have lasted about 45 minutes) a bunch o' danger things happen to Bond, which when they happen, you're just saying to yourself: ""Yea, that's something that would only happen to Bond."" I think it has to be said right away that I absolutely loved this film, not just because as we progress through his series, I feel Daniel Craig is the best Bond in terms of being able to emotionally relate to him when he goes through his trials and tribulations. Minus Quantum of Solace of course. But this movie also gives us its utmost best attempt at portraying Bond and the rest of MI6 to be more like what would be found in the modern day. However, this film is not perfect, not by a long shot. First off, it is way too long, clocking in at 144 minutes. The last 20-25 minutes could easily have been lopped off as it becomes more akin to a romance gone bad than a typical Bond movie. Second, the way it deals with the villain is atrocious. One of the things that made a Bond film a classic was the villain. You look at past movies like the early Sean Connery films and you remember that you had great villains in Dr. No and Blofeld. Le Chiffre belongs to that club as being a very memorable villain, playing this weapons dealer who's got his own issues to a tee. What ruins it, is how the plot develops to get rid of him. Of course, he's gonna be killed, this is a Bond film, the villain would never survive and make Bond look bad. But the way Le Chiffre is killed is partly a connection to the last 20 minutes when the actual villain of the story is revealed. But that is still the 20 minutes that I would have chopped off in the cutting room. But the movie's purpose in the portrayal is that there is always a higher up who is in more control of the supposed main characters. The other memorable part of Bond films tends to be the Bond Girl. In years past, Bond girls have been iconic characters like Pussy Galore covered in gold in Goldfinger, or just like her, the girls have had manic names. But in previous movies, they've been there, for the most part, for the pleasure of Bond. In this, Eva Green nails the performance by bringing out the emotional side of Bond. Their interaction is key and the building of their relationship is crucial as to how the plot progresses to defeat Le Chiffre. They start with this witty banter which moves to a more loving relationship after an ""unfortunate stairs scene"" involving Bond, Vesper and a couple of mad African killers. However, even after the twist that director Martin Campbell throws the viewers way, Bond is now in an emotional state that shows that the ""game"" is not all about him anymore and that there are people around who immensely care about him anymore. And this is the biggest redeeming factor of the movie as you get a complete rounding of Bond from being egotistical to by the end being the Bond that we're all used to seeing. And that is none too apparent than Bond not using his trademark line of ""The name's Bond, James Bond"" till the absolute end of the movie. Casino Royale does a great job of ""rebooting"" a franchise which had gotten over-reliant on using gimmicks and odd story-lines for their movies, in a way that made James Bond look like he was invincible. Casino Royale doesn't do that. You can actually feel every blow that Bond takes in the movie, and makes him almost like a normal, mortal human being and what it would be if they took that much punishment. There are reservations that I had about the film, a lot of them regarding the final 20 minutes, but I am willing to overlook that just cause the rest of the movie was shot marvelously. Casino Royale earns its 00 status and gets a B+ http://thefilmlawyers.wordpress.com for more reviews",positive

"First Bond movie I've ever seen (I saw Quantum of Solace a long time ago but don't really remember it at all). Pretty great action sequences, directing, and solid acting. I liked all the character development, which I've been told isn't always a strong suit of the Bond series.",negative
"As criticas fizeram-se ouvir com a escolha de Daniel Craig como o novo 007, no entanto o actor dá o seu melhor e em conjunto com um novo estilo mais realista e cenas de acção e tensão mais do que satisfatórias fazem de ""Casino Royale"" um dos melhores filmes da saga e um começo promissor de uma nova era para a personagem criada por Ian Flemming",positive
"This and Skyfall are the best Bond movies to date. It's a ""must watch"" film! Very entertaining. They got this film right. They could have arrested the villain on the beginning of the film (according to HISHE) but then it would have been boring. On top of that, it has the BEST END CREDIT SCENE EVER!!!

"Not only Daniel Craigs best bond film, but the best Bond film of them all. Connery may still be the best Bond but Casino Royale has everything in a bond film that we like to watch whether it be the poker, car, martini, one-liners, action, villain or plot twists. This movie definitely set up Quantum of Solace to be a disappointment.",positive
One word. Amazing! (Maybe six lol),positive
I thought Casino Royale was a very exciting movie with a lot of tefiffic acting. Daniel Craig makes a wonderfull jAMES but the villian sucks,positive
This film is fantastic. Quite possibly the best film of the entire franchise. ( next to of course skyfall),positive
"The introduction of Craig as Bond is just amazing. Through years of doubt as to whether Craig would be good for the role this should take down all doubters. Craig is intense and physical like the Bond of the books. No gags and one liners, just serious and great espionage.",positive
This movie was the best spy movie in recent times in my opinion.,positive
7/10 was ok but nothing in comparison to a brosnan bond,negative
"A direct shot on the reinterpretation of an icon of cinema. Leave the jokers gadgets, and the naive level of playground adventure, making way for subtle irony, with space for serious drama, much closest than we expected of a spy thriller upgraded.",positive
"Best Bond. It's very elaborate so it might take a couple viewing to catch exactly what's going on, especially towards the end but once you get everything stright it's a really excellent movie. Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Judi Dench and Mads Mikkelsen were seemingly born for these roles. The elaborate nature of the plot only makes the fictional organization being pursued more believable and more intimidating. This movie is like a tour of southern Europe with a lot more tension, sex, and dead bodies in stairwells.",positive
"Not only one of my favourite Bonds, it's one of my favourite movies. Period. Beautifully in line with Ian Fleming's novel with an added cinematic Bond flair.",positive
The worst Bond movie I have seen. Prologue consists of 007 assaulting some bloke at a urinal. Compare that with seat-edge Moonraker or TWINE. The scenes in Venice really didn't exploit the city. The characterisations are an unexpected pathetic attempt at realism for an otherwise escapist reality-suspending series.,negative
"Casino Royale is the Bond film that critics and filmgoers have been asking for, for years. The new bond, Daniel Craig helps a lot giving a gritty and more realistic bond nowadays, and he is great. But he is not the only good casting choice. There is some other casting choices that really work(Judi dench and vesper lynx).",positive

Great writing! Eva green is one of my favorite bond girls,positive

"My favourite movie of all time, Daniel Craig truly perfects Ian Flemings bond with such elegance and bravado!! Just the best!",positive
"Daniel Craig's Bond retains the style and charm of the role formerly occupied by Connery, Moore and co, but removes the silliness and reinvents him as a fallible, haunted human being with feeling and by God it works; the masterful Casino Royale is the best we've seen of the super agent since Goldfinger.",positive
"Grade:Low 8/10 Casino Royale is a Bond which really puts not just the entire franchise into a new place and direction, but also brings us the actual character of James Bond, changing and becoming something we have never seen before. With an in depth crime thriller and really what can only be said is a special agents film to be used as a template for success, Royale succeeds in bringing us the viewer a fantastic story and probably the best Bond film of all time, maybe. I felt it was firmly very good, and here below is why so. The story is very interesting, it doesn't mind backing off the massive stunts and fights in parts, but then when they do come they are done so well it just serves to make this even more suspenseful. It has a plot we rarely see also and with a villain to match that, Casino Royale really brings us a fresh plot and it is hard to find much wrong with most of the film. One last thing on the story is that is breathes suspense as said, knowing what will happen next is hard and any moment can throw Bond or others into unpredictable moments. Daniel Craig in his first outing as Bond is great, he maybe doesn't quite have the feel of Bond all the way through but that is what is so good, he took a risk in making a Bond different and it definitely pays off in a great way. Eva Green as the Bond girls is good too, she also brings a new type of Bond girl and they have a great chemistry that is really good to see from a franchise accused of sexism in it's past. I personally would have liked to have seen more of M in this Bond, it doesn't harm it but I think any Bond fan likes the some of the lines she can deliver. The script is pretty tight, it doesn't seem to stray at any time and is probably the strongest script Bond has ever produced, brings a surprisingly dramatic depth to the movie. Director Martin Campbell(director of Bond's Goldeneye) is good in this role here and brings consistency along with him from his previous Bond outing, again we find new life in Bond with him too. As I alluded too the stunts are amazing, the best we have seen ever and to be fair this movie, they aren't long sequences, they don't try hard to fit them in but my gosh do they work, spot on. I guess the only critical point would have to be the air that, well this isn't stereotypically a Bond movie, it does lack the music we so often get from Bond and anyone wanting a nostalgic look back on Bond is never going to get this from this movie. I guess it could also be said that Bond doesn't fit the Bond type(Craig has bulging arms and light hair), but I think the roughness reminds me of Connery and his not so save attitude at times but then when the women came, he was ready, as is Craig. Bond film fans should absolutely love this, if you watched Die Another Day before this too then even more so, it is a massive step up in Bond history, and one we kind of haven't seen since Goldfinger. It has a lot of good action and as said twice now stunts, those who enjoy that will also like this film as it can just as quietly dramatic as it can be loud but also with a tinge of drama running through it's historic veins. Overall I give this a low 8/10, it is Firmly a Very Good movie, I always think and want Bond to get better with every new movie but I tell you, if any top Casino Royale they well have to be Great because this is one Bond that knows how to get it done. Just watch it with ease and of course watch Daniel Craig in his first go at this, he shouldn't disappoint anybody and of course in any person is a fan of a good looking physique, well Daniel Craig coming out the sea may just excite you.",positive
"Thanks to a smart script, exciting action set pieces and a refreshing tone to the James Bond series. Casino Royale is not only one of the best bond films it is one of the best action films of all time and Daniel Craig delivers",positive
"Out of the handful of Bond movies I have seen...Casino Royale takes the cake. It got great characters, great story, amazing music, really great action and is just a really good movie. It shows off how badass Bond is actually supposed to be. I was happily surprised with how well Daniel Craig fit as Bond. Highly recommend this movie!",positive
"Excellent. 9.5/10. A. Awesomely awesometastic. With so many fantastic aspects (direction, script, characters, performances, cinematography, score), Casino Royale is both a non-stop thrill ride from beginning to end and an intelligent, realistic crime/thriller.",positive
"One of the best James Bond movie since Sean Connery's Bond action film, brings more fighting action and driving sequence and more villains to come for more Bond to go on a adventure. The best Bond of all time.",positive
"Quite possibly the greatest Bond to date, this espionage franchise gets reinvented in all the right ways. Formidable and endearing, this captivating masterpiece combines cutting-edge with sleekness. Finally casting aside the deplorable gadgetry, along with the smoke and mirrors drab that has undeniably mucked the waters, while also suppressing innovation. Bond has finally become real again, at last.",positive
Yet another great reinvigoration. Also an extra star for Eva greens voice.,positive
Throwing away the silly convenient gadgets and invisible car for more intense and suspenseful take of the famous secret agent.,positive
very good bond and best chase scene,positive
"The James Bond franchise definitely needs to change the tired and repetitive formula that we've seen so many times, yet Casino Royale is that game changer by making a more haunting and darker change in tone which works really well.",positive
Why were the Africans kids so happy to see a horse...,positive
One hell of a bond movie! Campbell and Craig at their best.,positive
"Definitely not the Bond you know. This one beats people up to a pulp, growls, loses his cool easily, and doesn't care what he drinks. Like his concoction ""vesper"", it sure looks refreshing - but will this new Bond be something you'll want to ""drink"" again? I think so; we found out that Bond doesn't really care if his martini is shaken or stirred - it's good either way. And so is this movie.",negative
Not much to say except an exceptional nearly flawless movie and the best James Bond Movie ever made. Daniel Craig is by far the best James Bond and there is no comparison.,positive
Inteligente y rápida. Con suficiente carisma entre Daniel Craig como James Bond y Eva Green para dar una buena bienvenida al nuevo Bond.,negative
Casino Royale is a step in the perfect direction. Daniel Craig puts on the tuxedo and gives a breathless and stunning performance as James Bond and gives Bond a whole new meaning. He gives Bond more emotional depth and character.,positive
The best bond film in my opinion...,positive
"I don't liked Daniel Craig as James Bond, frankly I don't like Daniel Craig as an actor. The film belongs to Eva Green who in the movie is portrayed as Bond's love interest and Mads Mikkelsen. There have so many Bond movies now that I'm sick and tired of James Bonds it's always the same plot. Bond meets women, Bond fucks women, Bond meets an international villain with some master plan.Bond against the odds saves the day.",negative
Daniel Craig makes a great actor for Bond.,positive
"No gadgets, no problem. This story of Bond creates a jaded, realistic character who seems like an actual living person, albeit extremely badass. Craig brings a moody, suave edge without the typical silliness which allows for a moore serious story and character arc. One of the better James Bond films I've ever seen in terms of emotional output by the characters and impact from the story itself.",positive
"The trailer is not for the movie, just a special dvd for it.",negative
I never watched a bond movie but this movie was the reason I started watching the bond movies.i think it does need an explanation that Craig really gets into the roll of James Bond I think everyone should watch this movie.,positive
Best Bond ever made!! Daniel Craig is perfect as James Bond . Eva Green is gorgeous and Mads Mikkelsen is terrific as Le Chiffre !,positive
best bond of all time!,positive
My favorite 007 film. Absolute ripper.,positive
fantastic a true classic for 007,positive
"The movie was quite different than any other spy movie like James Bond. Wasn't held back with too many cliches and was bolstered by an amazing performance by Daniel Craig. The torture scene was one of the best performances I've seen in a long time. It was helped by the very smart and a great dialogue that makes you go ""damn he really does have balls"". He was almost fantastic and he wasn't the only with a great performance. Eva Green was also marvelous in the movie and very smart with the performance. The direction and screenplay were top notice. It wasn't held down with idiotic over the top action sequences or a confusing plot that turns out to be just a mess. It stayed true to the bond series while giving something of its own. The cartoony Die another day and others from the series is lost and this was perfect for the movie. It wasn't also held back with a kind of crappy and weak villain. The villain wasn't just one person also and that brought an unique spin. There was always someone coming after bond and no real head villain trying to destroy bond. The movie also kept throwing thing at him and never led up for a moment. It was a little much but rewarding. We also see bond as this undeveloped agent that makes a few mistakes along the way, giving us a unique aspect of bond. It was again rewarding a make the imperfect moments feel real. Overall a solid movie bolstered by a great Bond performance. 9.1/10",positive
One of the best Bonds of all time.,positive
The ideal Bond formula; perfectly cast and exquisitely written.,positive
Somewhere in the top 5 best bond films in my book. Daniel Craig took bond to one his darkest places in this one.,positive
"Couldn't be better, Casino Royale fires up the Bond cannon after a four year break since the average Die Another Day, and says goodbye to gadgets and visual effect driven action scenes and goes for gritty action and pure style. Best of all the story is told superbly, rich with characters and subplots that connect beautifully leaving nothing unanswered. M sends 007 on a mission that takes him to lush locales such as Madagascar and the Bahamas where events lead him to Montenegro to go up against financier Le Chiffre in a high-stakes poker game at the Casino Royale, where Le Chiffre plans to win so be can pay back his deadly terrorist clients. Never before has an assignment felt so realistic in a Bond adventure, it's probably the smartest and well written since Goldeneye back in 1995. There is action that goes beyond anything you've ever seen, Bond climbs a construction site chasing after supremely talented freerunner Sebastien Foucan ending in one heck of a shootout, then there's the extremely tense airport chase where Bond attempts to foil a bombing, and the opening featuring Bond's first kills that promote him to ""00"" status is fierce and one of the best prologue's in Bond history, followed by Chris Cornell's excellent ""You Know My Name. However, whilst the action is constructed perfectly the poker games are what thrilled me the most, Martin Campbell directs with style ensuring you're feeling like a player or someone watching in the background, I love the focus on the player's tells and the facial expressions pulled by Bond and Le Chiffre. No review would be complete without mentioning how brilliant Daniel Craig is, or the supporting cast, Craig is witty, brutal and utterly convincing as 007. Eva Green is like the ultimate Bond girl, not playing a damsel in distress but a smart and sassy girl who puts Bond in his place. Judi Dench is one of the all time great actresses and M is one of her finest characters, I like her blunt nature towards Bond and no nonsense approach. Mads Mikkelsen is terrifying as Le Chiffre, he's probably the most realistic Bond enemy, seeing that he doesn't live in a volcanic hidden base or has a nuclear missile aimed at a satellite which is something we've seen in the past. Without a doubt Bond needed sprucing up, for a big fan of the franchise that's hard to say but it's true, especially after Die Another Day, and Casino Royale is the perfect entry to restart this explosive franchise.",positive
"My personal favorite Bond movie is Skyfall, but before that, it was this movie. I didn't really care for Daniel Craig for it, but had to watch this movie again to refresh my mind that Mads was the villain in this. I was so disappointed because Le Chiffre died so quick and unexpectedly. He had his fate coming, but I expected him to live longer, because he was such a fabulous villain.",positive
A thriller done right.,positive
Best Bond film besides SkyFall!,positive
Best Bond film besides SkyFall!,positive
"""Casino Royale"" is much darker and more poignant than any of its 007 predecessors. With an emphasis on plot rather than the clichéd gadgetry that have spoiled the series in recent times, this film doesn't disappoint, not to mention Daniel Craig makes one of the best James Bonds yet!",positive
"This should have been the first 007 movie, since it's based on the first 007 novel. I loved it. That and Skyfall.",positive

"Casino Royale is by far the best of the newest Bonds, with an exciting premise, masterful execution, and an overall Bond feel to it that is mesmerizingly good.",positive
Daniel Craig breathes new life into the series. This is the best Bond since the early Connery films. See my full review here: http://www.dustindye.net/movie-reviews/casino-royale-2006/,positive
"One of the best films of the decade, Daniel Craig proves to be the best Bond ever, and the gambling scenes were awesome. An extraordinarily classy, well-acted, and gritty spy thriller.",positive
"Fostered by Martin Campbell's talented direction and a trio of terrific and groundbreaking performances by Craig, Green and Mikkelsen, Casino Royale is a lively reinvention of the franchise, even if the final product is far too involved and lengthy.",negative
"Both thrilling and captivating, Casino Royale is a truly well done Bond film.",positive
"While Craig's 007 may not be as effortlessly suave as the one Connery originated, Casino Royale instead feeds upon his relentless intensity and haunted portrayal of one of cinema's most beloved characters. This isn't your dad's Bond; this is Bond of the twenty-first century.",positive
"Casino Royale is easily the best Bond film in the Daniel Craig canon of the franchise. After the depressingly over-dramatized gadgets and the horrendous depiction of the classic spy by Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig returns us to the awesomeness that is James Bond, while taking a darker point of view. The plot is very well thought out as it surprises us with every turn, making its mark on the thriller genre. The violence is all over the place, but used as a great plot motivator, and let's face it, no one will ever forget the torture scene. The torture scene and the multiple beatings Bond receives from his opponents play with the idea that James Bond isn't a ridiculously overpowered super-spy, but instead a human being who isn't always going to win. Overall, this modern reinvention of the classic spy hits home, and grandly enter Casino Royale into the list of greats.",positive
Casino Royale is an exhilarating and intense movie that stays true to the original bond movies but brings in something more as well.,positive
"Bond is reborn, Daniel Craig brings so much life and grace to the franchise.",positive
Slick High Octane Action Thriller! Daniel Craig single handedly jumpstarts the Bond series by dragging is wrinkly old ass kicking and screaming into a new modern era!,negative
Casino Royale is an awesome 21st revival outing for James Bond. The action set pieces are pretty splendid. If anything it is a little long but is worth it.,positive
A solid debut for Daniel Craig as James Bond with a ending that will leave you wanting more,positive
One of the best bond films ever,positive
best one out of the daniel craig series,positive
The crème de la crème of Bond films.,positive
so slow I wanted it to end five minutes in,negative
I don't understand why when he was first cast as the new reboot of James Bond people criticized the production company's choice! I think he absolutely played the role perfectly (he's also very hot as 007 ;) Was really sad to see (SPOILER ALERT) vesper take her own life even though she loved him and she was probably one of the many women he's slept with that he actually loves LYND AND BOND FOREVER! He's contracted to reprise the role for two more films (after Skyfall which may I add was fantastic as well) but atm out of the the films; Casino Royale is by far the best. Everyone that was disappointed in the choice of casting should be ASHAMED that this one one of the highest grossing Bond films to be made (before Skyfall),positive
"After Die Another Day the James Bond franchise went full reboot. We then got Casino Royale, which was the first Bond movie I ever saw and to this day is still my favourite movie of the franchise. This film is phenomenal. Daniel Craig is my absolute favourite Bond, he's dark, threatening and bloody brilliant. We also get the best Bond girl in Vesper Lynd, she's sexy, funny and very sympathetic. Eva Green was the perfect choice and my God does her last scene with Bond break my heart. We also get some of the best action ever, gone is the over the top gadget laden action and here we have brutal and fantastic hand to hand combat scenes. Le Chiffre is also a brillaint villain he's both menacing and sophistacted. Overall this is a fantastic Bond film and probably in my top 20 favourite movies of all time. A+",positive
"Not only is it the best Bond film, but it's one of the best thrillers ever made. It's violent, and gets rid of nonsense. Daniel Craig gives a great performance but even better is Mads Mikkelsen. An amazing film.",positive
"Because I was brought up by a pair of Bond veterans, I was at first a little skeptical that Casino Royale could live up to the legacy of the 1960s. Many Bonds had since been and gone, culminating in the abomination of an interpretation that was Brosnan. When I went to see the newest film in 2006 I wasn't sure what I was in for. ..when I came out there was only one thing I could say that suited my opinion of Casino: Daniel Craig's Bond is Sean Connery reincarnated. Charming, suave, ruthless and amoral, it's a return to the golden days of secret agents. And the arrival of a James Bond that at last matches up to, if not exceeds, the man Ian Fleming created.",positive
"After years of having a bond film that would stand to Goldfinger, Casino Royale is finally that bond film that both critics and fans deserve, but not the one they need. In my eyes, Sean Connery will always be the Bond,but Daniel Craig did a dam good job as 007. He pull an effective and appealing performance like he was Bond. The female lead was one of the best Bond girls the series had to offer. Martin Campbell did an amazing job directing this outstanding film that's both action packed and brings the Bond series to a whole new level. Truly the best Bond film since Goldfinger.",positive
"Whatever you say to me the best Bond actor Daniel Craig is. Has humanity because no matter how cold can be a person, there is something in the human. Judi Dench does a very good job, something hard in women is very common. Anyway, how many good things I could say this film has Bond in palabars resumire but small. INTERESTING, FRESH, FULL OF ACTION, GOOD DIRECTION, and FEEL JUST A BOND MOVIE.",positive
"Casino Royale is a fresh, realistic Bond adventure, with Daniel Craig reinventing and portraying Bond from Ian Flemming's first novel.",positive
james bond wasn't this fresh from goldeneye. great cast!,positive
Daniel Craig is incredible.,positive
"After the near franchise suicide that was ""Die Another Day"", the powers that be behind the Bond series had a mammoth task ahead of them. It would have been easy to give up then and there, no one would have batted an eye lid, but after a much needed rest, James Bond was recast and rebooted. ""Casino Royale"" finds James Bond going back to his roots, stepping back to before the worlds biggest spy became a double o agent. Bond is reckless, fresh and for once in his entire career, in serious trouble, as he finds himself on the trail of a huge organisation, layered with many contributors. One such contributor, La Chiffre, a deadly business man who has invested his partners money in shares, recklessly playing the stock market and finding himself in a world of debt and desperation. La Chiffre attempts to settle his debt by winning a poker tournament at The Casino Royale, however James Bond and MI6 have other plans, leading to one of Bonds biggest challenges yet. Returning to Bonds debut book and placing the charge in Martin Campbell's, director of ""Goldeneye"", hands, the James Bond franchise fires back into life, with all the impact of an atomic bomb. Gone are the ludicrous gadgets, over the top quips and most importantly an immortal Bond. Daniel Craig totally destroys all previous efforts, dating back to Connery, as our hero James Bond, he is a reckless killing machine, charming and chiseled, with an abundance of class, Bond has never been played so well and it shows. In fact all of the cast deliver a sterling performance, Mads Mikkelson is one of the best Bond villains ever to grace our presence, Judi Dench is ferocious as M, Eva Green is a powerful and formidable assistant for Bond, even Giancarlo Gianni is magnificent as Bond's middle man, Matthis. The entire cast hit all the right notes, which is formidable enough, however Casino Royale's writing is a cut above a vast quantity of Bond outings. Characters are rich and complex, the film is vast and weighty and the new direction never feels stale or lost. That's not to say that everything James Bond has ever been is gone, he's hardly a shadow of his former self, however Campbell strips Bond back, makes it dangerous and takes some risks. One such risk is Casino Royale's main set piece, unlike previous outings, most James Bond films would contain a plethora of action sequences, culminating in one outstanding spectacle, here however the writers and Campbell take a different approach, allowing the meat of the piece to be the card game itself, lasting almost 45 minutes of screen time, Campbell makes every hand just as tense and riveting as the action set pieces before and after it, its a welcomed change of tact, allowing fans to venture outside their comfort zone and experience something new, that's not to say Campbell's venture doesnt crank up the violence or stunt work, quite the opposite, the first hour of Casino Royale is littered with some of the best action Bond has ever undertook and what makes it more memorable is the fact that Craig forces his character to get hurt, to make mistakes, this arc makes every fight, every explosion feel threatening. Casino Royale continually feels fresh, throwing convention to the wind and looking outstanding doing so. There are a few hiccups, some dialogue is laughably atrocious, luckily these porkers are placed far away from each other, the ending feels like the entire engine is running out of fuel, it still rivets but never outshines the wonderful card game, and we are left with an ending that clearly baits for a sequel. None of these factors hinder the overall experience, ""Casino Royale"" is tense, well crafted and the best outing Bond has seen since ""Goldeneye"", Craig is perfect as Bond and his supporting cast deliver some of the most memorable performances from the entire franchises history. Although a huge departure from previous installments, some fans may miss franchise regular hijinks and the stupidity of some of the more flamboyant Bond moments and Casino Royales gas does start to run out in the final act, Campbell and Craig deliver something new and exciting, leaving us with a much needed revitalization that seemed impossible years prior.",positive
Top Movies. (10) OWN BLU-RAY,positive
"Incredible, dazzling and haunting, Daniel Craig delivers a smart performance in one of the greatest action films in movie memory.",positive
Pretty awesome reboot of the first 007 movie. Craig is edgy and a bit dark which I liked. Awesome bad guy portrayal.,positive
The BEST Bond hands down.,positive
"It's a welcome and entertaining reboot of the flagging Bond franchise, but much has been lost in the transition.",negative
"Daniel Craig introduces us to a much more rough-around-the-edges Bond with more humanity and less fakeness. The movie as a whole is stripped down to a much more gritty and realistic tale. Even though the plot is less outrageous than the standard fare of Bond movies, it manages to be hugely entertaining. Great action and stunts, a bigger focus on characterization/dialog, diverse locations - the movie is solid, and even the slower sequences involving poker manage to keep you engaged with the tension and high stakes. For a movie of this type it's pretty much as good as it gets.",positive
Amazing storyline and action! My favorite Bond movie ever!!!,positive
"The dark, gritty, and more realistic reboot of the beloved Bond franchise is definitely the rejuvenation we needed. Towards the end of the Brosnan era, the franchise was taking a step towards ridiculousness and obscurity more than ever before, and this reboot was just what was needed to revitalize the franchise. Director Martin Campbell (also the director of Goldeneye) brings another great Bond film and once again introduces us to a great, new Bond. Daniel Craig portrays what's the closest representation of Ian Fleming's Bond from the novels and in doing so, became associated with being one of the best Bonds. Easily one of the best Bond films out there and one that fits in very appropriately with our 21st century ideals.",positive
"Fun, intense, gritty, smart, and EXTREMELY entertaining, Casino Royale, thanks to Craig's magnetic performance, breathes new life into the franchise. 007 truly is back!",positive
"Finally catching up with the Daniel Craig Bond films. This was fun, but with a lot of reservations. For one, it was too darn long. Especially since just when you think it's about to end, it starts right back up again. I also get tired of ordinary people being able to take endless beatings and keep on going. Or being able to jump from 20' high and not break their legs. Tell me these guys have titanium exo-skeletons and I'm totally on board. Otherwise, please try, just a little, to maintain some sense of realism. I also get so sick of everyone double-crossing everyone else. I expect it in a movie like this, but come ON. I just gave up and rolled my eyes 360 degrees at the last one. Ok, that was my negative stuff. On the positive side, I thought the movie was well written, acted, directed, etc. I like that they took some efforts to make Bond, as a character, more human. There was some gritty stuff here, and it works. Daniel Craig made for a great Bond, and I look forward to seeing the next two. Eva Green was great, too, and beautiful to boot. I understand Quantam isn't quite as good, but I'll watch it so I can get to Skyfall.",positive
"007 at his best. A Bond for our times, indeed.",positive
"A superb Bond film. Worlds better than ""Quantum of Solace"" and even better than ""Skyfall"". This Bond is intense, action packed, and of course: filled with beautiful women. One of the best parts about this Bond however, is the constant twisting and turning that keeps you guessing throughout. And even though I knew where the movie was going at times, for example, of course we know Bond will win the poker game and the girl. And of course when a James Bond movie is getting really sappy and dragging on at the end, something must be wrong in paradise. Even with all these givens it still kept its intrigue. The Daniel Craig Bond series has brought an excellent new twist on the franchise and are a must watch for Bond fans and your average movie fan alike.",positive
"Eva Green... The best Bond girl of all time by my account. Interesting and thrilling movie, but must admit I didn't like it the first two times I watch mostly because of the new Bond... it took a little to settle down but now I think this movie is one of the greatest Bond movies ever",positive
Great start to this new Bond.,negative
"In my opinion, the greatest Bond film ever made. With deep character insight/development, a nice twisty plot and strong acting from all leads. A little light on action compared to Skyfall, but has a better written story with more investment in Bond himself.",positive
Bad***. The only way I can put it. It's Daniel Craig's first Bond flick and easily his best. It's my second favorite James Bond movie and its also considered one of the best for good reason. I really like this one.,positive
"Calling ""Casino Royale"" the best Bond movie is a understatement since I only saw two of them, but thanks to its suspenseful, thrilling, and engaging storyline, I think it's safe to say it ua. Daniel Craig nails the role, and I hope he continues to wear the suit for years to come.",positive
Now THIS is a Bond film!,positive
It's a good movie but not really what James Bond is about. Like the casino part. And I like it when there is a lot of action.,negative
My favorite of the Bond films followed closely by Goldfinger.,positive
"Daniel Craig is charming and just really good as Bond, maybe even the best one so far.",positive
"While Craig isn't our best Bond on screen, he certainly gives the franchise a fresh touch.",positive
"Casino Royale is a great film. The action is great, the story, the direction, the script, the poker scenes, the Bond girl and Bond himself are all great. This and Skyfall are both equally as great.",positive
"Along with FRWL, best Bond ever!",positive
"This film gets rid of all the over-the-top silliness and gadget bullshit that the previous few James Bond films had. Casino Royale seems to take us on a whole new level of hardcore action and storytelling which involves James now played by Daniel Craig who was rightfully earned his 007 status in the MI6 by executing a pair of assassins. Then he travels to Madagascar where he spies on terrorist Mollaka played by Sebastien Foucan and later tracks down the rest of the terrorists in the Bahamas. Leading him to the company of the mysterious Dimitrios played by Simon Abrakrian, and his girlfriend Solange played by Caterina Murino, bond soon realises that he is closer than ever to locating well-guarded terrorist financier Le Chiffre played by Mads Mikkelsen. That's pretty much what the plot is. the rest of the film is pretty much action and suspense. This was Daniel Craig's first film starring as the lead character and he owned it. He reminded me a bit of Sean Connery because of his voice and the way certain scenes were played out in the film. Before this, he starred in the brute gangster thriller Layer Cake which i found to be a cool movie and gave it a good score. When he was casted, movie critics and fans went vitally crazy making up quotes such as ""The Name's Bland. James Bland."" and internet campaigns such as ""danielcraigisnotbond.com"" but when proved to them, they all got the opposite reaction and the movie was a success and it deserves to be a success. This interesting, psychological study of 007 promises everything that the fans have been waiting for including me; therefore it is ranking up with my other favourite James Bond movies dating back to the Sean Connery movies. Casino Royale (2006) aka Bond 21 gets a 9.8/10.",positive
"Casino Royale cumple muy bien su función de ambientarnos en un universo mucho más crudo, oscuro y de alguna forma ""realista"" para nuestro querido agente 007. Sin embargo, ese pequeño desequilibrio entre la acción y la tranquilidad hace que sintamos unos cambios y/o transiciones bastante repentinas y bruscas, y pienso que ese puede ser un punto bastante declinante. Pero con un muy buen guión, una historia de espionaje bien realizada, actuaciones de primera y suspenso por doquier, la convierte en una de las mejores peliculas de Bond.",positive
"Casino Royale is the grounded reboot of the long running 007 franchise. Daniel Craig instantly proves his star power, owning as role as the cool and collected James Bond. The action is very well shot and very intense. It's very intense, and you almost feel the brutality and grittiness of the story. The plot is compelling and very well told. It's mysterious, exciting, well acted, and well written. It's also one of the best action films of the decade. I also loved seeing Bond gain his 007 status in a brutal first scene. Maybe it's a bit too long, but a this movie proves that Bond movies can be exciting and well made. Casino Royale gets 4.5/5 stars (A).",positive
"Explosive, engrossing, personal and poignant, Daniel Craig revives the Bond phenomenon with panache and proficiency.",positive
".There should be an anticipation associated with a new James Bond film. Casino Royale has the excitement of watching Texas Hold em with bad commercials. The movie begins with a very exciting scene in Madagascar. The low level very talented acrobatic bad guy being chase by Bond through a construction site destroying everything and the crane scene was incredible and the actions got us comfortable for another great thriller. Alas with lowered expectations we were exposed to Bond women whom did nothing to remind us of the early Bond classics. The bad guy has a blind eye that bleeds and creeps you out and is distracting. This is a guy that is trying to extort money through a gambling game where all 15 contestants must put up 10 Million dollars with the winner moving that money into their own personal account. The premise is sound but the relationship between Bond and the Vesper Lynd character is like watching dieting tips on the VIEW. We get it that its the chess match love match, but it takes the early exciting scenes and turns this into a romantic flick disguised as an action show. Luckily Craig shows his very stiff acting ability in a scene in the airport that is very exciting as Bond foils the largest plane in the world from getting a rude sendoff. Fill in the blanks. The gadgets that I was waiting to see and the brief time that the fun character Q is missing. We are forced to listen to the whining M whom is one character that doesn't appear to add any value to the movie. This is a movie to fast forward through many scenes. I understand the need to upgrade the Ian Fleming classic but the new Bond doesn't have it in this movie. I'll give him another chance in the next movie but this should be one and done. The need to sleep through many parts of this movie only stirred me occasionally. The grand finale ended after the 1st half hour of the movie and like paint drying I got bored stiff. I haven't been this dissapointed since the other stiff Superman Returns. The Casino scenes were mildly intertwined with bad guys beating up Bond and vice versa. Don't waste your time go rent one of the originals they were corny but we didn't have to agonize between the new sensitive Bond at the end of the movie. The scenery was terrific but the acting and bad chemistry between Craig and the Bond women leave us looking for someone cool with the smarts to outwit the bad guys and gadgets that are clever and make us wanting to watch it over again. Keep your options open this is a poor effort with so much potential.",negative
One of the best Bond movies ever made. First class.,positive
THE BEST BOND FILM EVER MADE,positive
"A more serious reboot of the James Bond franchise. I'm not a James Bond fan, but I quite liked this film. More depth.",negative
awesome James Bond flick.,positive
its a really good movie and a good start for daniel craig as bond,positive
A monumental film that highlights Craig's acting chops.,positive
"Daniel Craig is not the typical pretty boy Bond which we are used to, but he can certainly act the role and put some angst that nobody did. Together with an incredible storyline, Casino Royale will be one of the greatest Bond films. What struck me the most about this story is Bond is not portrayed as a thug who just kills a lot of bad guys, he certainly out smarts then too!",positive
"The new benchmark, it combines style and suspense in a recipe that is modern, but still quintessentially Bond.",positive
O recomeço da franquia de James Bond em grande estilo.,positive
"Here's the thing: I don't like seeing James Bond doing impossible things without getting hurt, fuckin cartoonish chase sequences, killing lame villains, destroying public properties without any real purpose, just for visual pleasure. Casino Royale corrects many mistakes that have been made in the previous Bond films. It has bit unpredictable plot and that's very good for a Bond movie. Casino Royale follows James Bond on his first mission as he must stop Le Chiffre, a banker to the world's terrorist organizations, from winning a high-stakes poker tournament at Casino Royale in Montenegro. Daniel Craig makes a superb Bond:Leaner, more taciturn, less sex-obsessed, able to be hurt in body and soul, not giving a damn if his martini is shaken or stirred. Craig is bloody damned great as Bond, in a movie that creates a new reality for the character. Director Martin Campbell builds suspense in the extended poker game by not being afraid to focus for long seconds on the eyes of the two main opponents, which is all the more effective because Le Chiffre's left eye has tears of blood, inspiring a classic Bond line. Bond's absences from the table are of more than ordinary interest.Also, every action scene is mindblowing. Visuals are absolutely stunning. Overall, Casino Royale is a strong, well defined story, some unexpected betrayals and hidden corners,sensational locations make Casino Royale a right royal Bond movie.",positive
"""A fantastic James Bond 007 film. Daniel Craig nails it. A classic!""",positive
"Possibly one of the most, if not the most critically acclaimed Bond installment. Martin Campbell directs a sleek, suspenseful and provocative revamping of the acclaimed Ian Fleming saga. It's filled with action, drama and unexpectedness all due to the flare and flamboyance of a strong story and delivery of Daniel Craig. 5/5",positive
My favorite Bond movie.,positive
"Brilliant opening sequence sets a fresh, thrilling, athletic tone to this new Bond. In the theatre, I remember wanting to see the opening sequence again because of its dangerous real-time stunts - you can't fake those, and kudos if somehow they did. The 'torture scene' - lame and barely quease-inducing, instead of the much needed intensity. But I loved every minute of Dame Judy Dench - ballsy, brash, and hilarious, in the most straight forward way. Craig jumped up and set an incredibly high mark for the Bond franchise. I grew up w Roger Moore era Bond, and enjoyed the stunts and the humor, despite its getting giddy and over-the-top. Great for a young boy growing up. Here, there is a sly sophisticated humor, and the overall renewed intensity makes this stand tall, next to all the previous Bonds. Simply Brilliant. 4 out of 5 shaken not stirreds",positive
"It's official (well, for this long-time Bond-fan): Daniel Craig is the best bond ever.",positive
"The action on its own is more than satisfying, but the film's biggest achievement is its drama and humanization of a grandiose action hero. Sure, car chases are fun, hit jobs and explosions are cool, but I would take Craig's Bond in Casino Royale any day: an intense, arrogant, and yet vulnerable human being with emotional needs and goals like anyone else.",positive
This might be the best bond movie in the series and Daniel Craig is 007,positive
"A purely epic joy ride with all the action, comedy, suspense, romance, and ""shoot-em up"" scenes that defines the 007 franchise.",positive
"More of a ruff and tumble bond making for a tense and fast passed movie. Judi is a gem and steals the whole movie with hard hitting style. Cinematography, sets, style, toys all add to the fabulous overall entertainment value of this Bond movie. It does not just rely on the past, but works hard to keep to the previous standards set. Nibbles: Skewered Lamb.",positive
"While I admit I usually go for films like the franchise of 007, James Bond has never been one of my favorite franchises to sit through. I've seen all the Sean Connery films and they were great but could care less on other additions like the ones with Roger Moore, particularly the goofiness that supposedly dumbed down the original characterization of the character. This skepticism went on down to the Bond films made today, starring Daniel Craig. It took me this long to finally give the reboot a go, and I was very impressed with how it turned out. Based on the very first book in the Bond series (why it was never made a big-screen film until now, I have no clue), James Bond (Daniel Craig) is given his status as 007 (license to kill and all), and uses his skills to go after a very corrupt and wealthy terrorist (Mads Mikkelsen) that he uncovers while bringing down a bomb-maker in Madagascar. By teaming up with treasurer Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), who finances Bond in this mission, Bond has to cleverly defeat this madman in a high stakes poker game at Casino Royale where the winnings can be used to bankrupt the terrorist from making any more threats. Before I go on with this reboot, let me give a little history on the Bond franchise up to this point. By 2006, many audiences had given up with another James Bond film. Though the character had made a comeback with Goldeneye in 1995 (one I'm not familiar with), the followups with Pierce Bronsnan returned to the level of criticism in the Roger Moore films, with 2002's Die Another Day considered a very low point in the franchise. As plans were announced for a reboot, reports were very mixed on what was to come. Daniel Craig, the star, was typecasted as too short for the role, but director Martin Campbell's (of Goldeneye) involvement gave fans an optimistic hope. Not only did Casino Royale defy expectations, but it also gave the franchise a sign that it's ready to tackle new challenges in each decade. And Casino Royale works well in the fact that the producers opted for a grittier storyline that was more faithful to Ian Fleming's original intentions. This decision paid off big time, from the very stylish b&w opening sequence where Bond receives his 007 status, action to the point of exhilaration you get in the Bourne movies (the stuntwork in this is phenomenal, particularly the crane sequence in Madagascar), and even up to the point where Bond is actually depicted as not an invincible superhero like others depicted him as. In a scene that was very hard to sit through, the villains force Bond to severely wreck his high-priced Ashton Martin, to where they capture him, strip him, tie him to a chair, and literally torture him for information. The scene is very brutal and very deserving of it's PG-13 rating (the fact that Bond was in the nude in this scene almost gets it to an R in my book had it not been for the lighting), but I'm glad that it shows that Bond actually gets some heavy hits once in a while. Many critics have described Casino Royale as ""the perfect James Bond film"", but I don't think so. Though I appreciate the darker edge of the film, I wasn't satisfied enough. For one, the film's pacing is a little rough, particularly in the casino scenes. I know it plays a very integral role to building up the plot, but I was a little restless in the buildup, almost to the point where I dozed off. But thankfully, as the buildup intensifies, the film goes back to that dazzling feeling of a sharp and intense spy thriller. In the experiences I've had with 007, I've always thought that Sean Connery is the ultimate Bond, due to his awesome sense of style and sharpness he puts on the table. Though Daniel Craig comes nowhere close to Connery's awesomeness (especially when compared to Goldfinger), Craig still manages to pack a punch in his own right. As mentioned earlier, Craig's cold, hard stares show us that Bond is more than just an invincible spy with all these cool gadgets to show off every 5 seconds. As Roger Ebert put it, ""Craig makes a superb Bond ... who gives the sense of a hard man, wounded by life and his job, who nevertheless cares about people and right and wrong"". And I have to say it again, he clearly nails his emotions in scenes of true grit, such as the ending and that torture scene. Another plus is how the film doesn't go into any dated sexism that plagued a lot of the older films. For once, there is not a 007 film with any nude women in the opening credits, and that's a big refresher. Sure Bond still has sex with women, but I felt it wasn't glorified like in past releases (the one Roger Moore film I saw literally depicted Bond as a sex addict). A big irony here is that 007 has the eyes on the sex table unlike the Bond girls over the years. In one scene, he walks away from the beach in a similar manner to Ursula Andress in Dr. No, and it's 007 that actually gets stripped of clothing instead of any women this time. This is another reason why I think Casino Royale is a strong effort of moviemaking when anything stands up against stereotyping and sexism. I also have to give Eva Green credit as she's one of the Bond girls that actually has some attitude and class compared to the countless of bland actresses that have teamed up with 007 over the years. Her chemistry with Craig is excellent to where it actually shows them in their intense relationship, and the emotions actually click this time around. I also loved that 007's boss M is actually female this time around, as it gives the two more memorable chemistry to come around. And Judi Dench nails at what she's given. Sadly though the villain is still another generic baddie in the world of 007. Though Mads Mikkelston gives it his all in the performance, I was never given any clear reason to the villain's motives of blowing up stuff. But I at least give him credit for delivering in the character's sadism during the said torture scene. David Arnold scored the film (one of five that he did). Arnold's not one of my favorite composers (his score for the 1998 Godzilla is a horrendous ripoff of John Williams music), but I really liked what he does in this film. He maintains the jazz vive that brought the franchise to popularity in the first place, and creates a faithful adaptation of that classic Bond theme. As for the film's traditional theme song of the show, I liked Chris Cornell's ""You Know My Name"" as it showed the framework of a grittier Bond film, but it's nowhere as memorable as Bond songs of the past (nothing can top Paul McCartney's ""Live and Let Die""). It still has it's weak spots (particularly in pacing and in villainy), but Casino Royale is one of the best Bond films I've seen. Though my thoughts for best Bond still goes to Sean Connery, I applaud the studio for creating a grittier storyline and its hard, very intense, Jason Bourne-styled action. Plus Daniel Craig still packs a punch on his own as a great 007 and the emotional level is raised to a whole new level for the franchise. After finally watching Casino Royale, though I still wouldn't consider myself a fan of the franchise, at least it gives me a little hope in experiencing some of the other films, particularly the other films starring Daniel Craig. ""I have no armor left. You've stripped it from me. Whatever is left of me - whatever is left of me - whatever I am - I'm yours. """,positive
"Great reboot of a never-ending saga of a new and captivating 007, played by a big Daniel Craig, who seems to have embodied the true James Bond",positive
"Textbook Filmmaking and the perfect James Bond film. Not only is the action and suspense absolutely spectacular but it really explores the beginnings of James Bond as a double O agent. Daniel Craig is my favourite bond. I know it's a cliche choice but he really has the perfect balance of manliness and smoothness. Mads Mikkelsen plays a great villain and Eva Green plays one of the best Bond girls ever. She is smart, sophisticated and probably the most complex bond girl since Diana Rigg in 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. ""You Know My Name - Chris Cornell"" is also one of the best bond songs. It has that perfect mix of classic bond flare with a new alternative sound grounded in the 21st Century. Casino Royale is not just one of the best Bond films, it's one of the best action films ever made!",positive
"Great film, Craig is a great action star.",positive
The poker scenes in this movie are atrocious.,positive

My bros favorite movie ever,positive
Definitely a fan of Daniel Craig's James Bond.,positive
"Too much action, too little wit.",negative
"Casino Royale starts quick and sees Bond in Uganda chasing a bomb maker through a building site. The movie is very fast paced up until the middle when they play poker for about 30 minutes which slows the film down. This is the only downside of the film. Bond travels to Uganda, Bahamas, Miami and Italy in the film",negative
"IMO the best Bond film ever, and one of my favorite movies.",positive
quite possibly the best bond ever made. tied with goldeneye and goldfinger,positive
Daniel Craig as an all new James Bond is great!,positive
"This one doesn't quite ""feel"" like a Bond film to me, and I'm not exactly sure why. I think maybe I felt that Craig's Bond lacks some of the dark humor of other incarnations; we'll see how I feel when I see the other Craig films. That said, this movie has an AWESOME Parkour chase scene at the beginning, and more plot twists and double-crosses in the final 20 minutes than most movies have in their whole run time. But that run time is a problem. Those last 20 minutes seem tagged on after the story is all over, like the love story that the writers forgot to include while the action was going on. There's a definite sense of looking at your watch because the bad guy is dead, so why is there still movie? It's like watching the deleted scenes on the DVD, except that you haven't seen the credits yet. Maybe if they had cut out oh, I don't know, about 45 minutes of poker playing in the middle, it wouldn't have felt that way.",negative
Watched it again and I think it gets better the more you watch it. It's a near perfect popcorn movie.,positive
Not bad for my 2nd experience of Bond. I thought the story was better than skyfall. it made me want to play poker :-) Still not a fan of Bond or action films,negative
The best James Bond yet.,positive
"Casino Royale is an action-packed film, with phenomenal stunt choreography. It's a good introduction to the James Bond series.",negative
"Casino Royale very well may be the best James Bond movie ever. In Daniel Craig's debut as James Bond, the plot is more thought out and it proposes the idea that James Bond may not always win.",positive
Sick Bond. Action packed movie.,negative
"No more crazy gadgets, thankfully. Casino Royale and Daniel Craig takes Bond back to his roots in this tense, action-packed installment. I have to admit, it's quite clever, too.",positive
"Casino Royale is an extremely successful reboot of the 007 series. Daniel Craig is a wonderful new Bond. The ending to this film is pretty vague, though.",positive
After years of disappointing bond films 2006 marked the comeback of bond. In 2006 this was the best bond since 1977's The Spy Who loved Me. Yep thats right I didn't care much for Pierce Brosnan's Bond movies.,positive
"Okay movie! Daniel Craig is a modern Jason Bourne style Bond. The action scenes and the mannerism of the modern Bond is exacting to Jason Bourne character of the Bourne Identity. However, Craig can not deliver the humor of the other Bond's Pierce Bronson, and Roger Moore. Daniel Craig Bond needs a more humorous edge. The Casino Royale script is exciting, but leaves the viewer hanging. The movie's strong point is the Bad guys characters. The characters are educated, cold and professional. The scene with the guy who keeps tearing during the card game is memorable. I give Quantum of Solace three stars.",negative
"A return a to good James Bond films after the terrible movie before. Not the best James Bond film but certainly the best in years, probably since Goldeneye.",positive
The best James Bond movie of all time. I never knew I could be on the edge of my seat during a poker game but Campbell and his sensational cast did just that.,positive
Best bond movie since goldeneye. Vesper is SO HOT,positive
'Perfect' is not enough to describe this perfection.,positive
A revolution for 007 films,positive
"A richly entertaining action flick with good lines, good stunts, good heart, and some really good brains.",positive
"Great Bond film. Every aspect of this film is great, and there really are no flaws. Great movie if you are a Bond fan or not.",positive
"Pretty awesome, if a little long winded.",positive
"Premier film de Daniel Craig en tant que James Bond et surment l'un des meilleurs de la série. Craig apporte une certaine fraicheur au personnage et , avec Sean Connery et Timothy Dalton, le meilleur interprète de Bond",positive
Bond at his best! Best film of them all,positive
"The Bourne Identity clearly gave Bond a real kick up the backside as they quickly realized that Bond was losing his relevance. Bring in Martin Campbell and give the reigns of one of cinema's most iconic characters to Daniel Craig and you get 'Casino Royale', a gritty and dark outing for Bond and a huge return to form. It's just such a shame that it was ruined by a vastly inferior sequel.",positive
"The perfect 007 movie with one of the best Bonds ever, Daniel Craig",positive
FANTASTIC!!!! Great action sequences!!!! Mikkelsen proves himself to be the best Bond villain ever!!,positive
"After the Pierce Brosnan era of James Bond, the series was rebooted in 2006 with Daniel Craig as the new James Bond and taking away the silliness of the previous James Bond films and making it more realistic. The film was titled after the first book in the Ian Fleming series which was titled Casino Royale. There was a public outcry from fans of the series about Daniel Craig being cast as James Bond with some people even saying that he was the worst James Bond ever even before the movie came out. He wasn't well known at the time, but is now famous because of his role. Casino Royale is a masterpiece of film and in my opinion the best movie of 2006 and the best James Bond movie to date. Casino Royale stars Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, and Judi Dench and the film is directed by GoldenEye director Martin Campbell. I don't want to explain the plot of Casino Royale because it'll take a long time to explain and I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie, but the plot is absolutely fantastic for this movie. It has no plotholes, its very well written,and very dark. Daniel Craig is absolutely incredible as James Bond and is way better than Roger Moore,Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan and is on par with Sean Connery as the best James Bond. Daniel Craig gives the best performance of his career in this movie and he also did a great job in Quantum of Solace and Skyfall which I'll review later at some point. Eva Green does a great job as the Bond Girl in this movie named Vesper and in my opinion the best Bond Girl in the whole series. Mads Mikkelsen plays Le Chiffre, the villain in this movie and does a fantastic job playing him. Le Chiffre is also the first James Bond villain to ever appear in the books, but not in the first James Bond movie. Judi Dench doesn't have a lot of screen time, but she does a good job as M. The action is some of the best ever captured on film. They are very realistic unlike the previous Bond films like Die Another Day which had very over the top action scenes. Martin Campbell understands action and I hope he does another Bond film in the future. The film is also very intense and riveting. I have never seen poker games more riveting in any movie ever. The film has a great score although the James Bond theme isn't in this movie because this movie is the beginning of James Bond, but the theme is a big part of the James Bond series. The film is very, very dark and it goes back to the serious tone of the first few James Bond movies like Dr. No and From Russia With Love. The film has a torture scene in it that is very gritty and visceral and I think its one of the best scenes in the movie because of how its filmed and acted. I forgot to mention that this film is a reboot of the whole James Bond series so no Die Another Day, A View to a Kill, The Man with the Golden Gun like films anymore. Now the question is that if I like this movie more than the previous films like Dr. No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, and GoldenEye and my answer is yes and no. I think that the action scenes in this movie are better than the old ones and the film is very eerie, but I miss the gadgets and the crazy stunts like in the previous films. I do think that Casino Royale is a film that James Bond fans like me and casual moviegoers will enjoy. I consider Casino Royale to be the best movie of 2006 and one of the best movies of the 2000's and one of the best movies ever made.",positive
"Daniel Craig's first Bond film is one of the series' very best. A complete reboot, it starts the series back off on a whole different note, establishing a more realistic and serious feel. Daniel Craig is outstanding as 007 and does a great job showing the agent's dark side, as well as his vulnerable side when faced with betrayal and loss. The action scenes are great and are a lot more convincing and realistic than those of the previous Brosnan films. This a solid entry in the series, and a great start to the Daniel Craig era.",positive
"I'm not a Blondie type and couldn't see one as bond but after watching this film, I couldn't imagine anyone else filling his predecessor's spot! Man what a ride!",positive
"If you like James Bond or the game of poker, this is a must see. It is the best movie ever made about either.",positive
The first film in a the reboot of the James Bond franchise. Very good indeed. Real action heavy in the first hour or so. The second half at a bit can be plodding but still very good. I highly recommend if you are a fan of action and James Bond films,positive
4 stars! Definitely the best James Bond out of them all! Very action packed and just plain great! Daniel Craig is beautiful and a great actor.,positive
Another great James Bond film with a great storyline and perfect ending as always.,negative
"Absolutely brilliant. Daniel Craig does a fantastic job of playing the new James Bond, with some interesting twists and action making this film interesting from start to finish. Must watch!",positive
"Okay so roughly right after we saw Cloud Atlas, Blaine and I watched all of Daniel Craig's Bond films so with that done, let's begin to wrap up this James Bond movie marathon with Casino Royale. Plot: After getting his 00 status back, Bond kills a bomb-maker in Madagascar and takes his phone and tries to track it to find out who he's working for. Eventually, his lead leads him to a terrorist financier named Le Chiffre. So Bond is assigned to bankrupt Chiffre in a high-stakes poker game with the help of the treasury employee assigned to provide the money, Vesper Lynd. As soon as Blaine and I got to the beginning of the title sequence to this film, I was hooked. This film isn't even meant to precede or succeed any of the other Bond films, it's basically a reboot of the whole franchise. And the result is a film that is very smartly written. The story is very different from the other Bond films and is more realistic and more thought out. In fact it's a very character and story heavy movie - there wasn't a whole lot of action compared to a lot of the other films in my opinion. When I was only planning to get to Craig's films, my brother who has seen this movie and Skyfall said that Craig is viewed to be a very, very different kind of Bond. And he's turning out so far to be absolutely right. Craig's Bond is much more darker and gritty as Bond which is similar to Timothy Dalton as Bond, but he's more reckless, brutal and cold with how he's very focused on the mission, but he's also vulnerable in a couple of ways. Also he and M and kind of starting to be a little more personal around each other which is starting to make her much more interesting. And then you have Vesper who is less of a sex object then probably any of the other Bond girls. In fact she's probably the more human then most of the characters in probably any James Bond film in general. She's very smart and focused on the mission but when it comes down to witnessing Bond fighting the bad guys she can be very vulnerable in a much more believable and realistic way rather then just follow Bond around and look pretty. In fact she's probably one of the very best Bond girls because of how she's much more of an actual person to care for just like Tracy in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Also there was at least some gadgets while not really shown majorly like Die Another Day which was really nice, and the title sequence was just awesome. Finally while the ending may have taken longer then some people felt it should've been, it was done very well and is altogether a great example at how Craig's Bond is starting to go a very different route from the Bond movies in a lot of ways. And that's my review for Casino Royale, while dying down from gadgets and action for the most part, we seem them replaced with a whole new kind of Bond that is smarter, more edgy, very character and story heavy and is altogether very different from the Bond films making this a great Bond film and a great movie in general.",positive
The chemistry between Craig and Green is perfect while the plot is thrilling and very smart. The best Bond movie to date.,positive
Review coming soon....,positive
"Best 007 film there is. Craig brings a fantastic take on what was a stale character at the time of release, re-energizing the series.",positive
"Rather than being a mindless exploitation designed to pander to hot-blooded, conservative men, this Bond actually has characterization, an interesting plot, and spectacle with the potential to stand the test of time. Bond's ego and sociopathic tendencies are put front and center as character flaws he's in constant battle with as he attempts traversing the hectic world provided by the nature of his job. Bond's humanity, growth, conflicts, and relationships feel believable, and actually get the audience involved in a non-superficial capacity. Casino Royale is not only the best Bond movie by far, but it gives the audience an engaging experience rivaling timeless action/thriller movies.",positive
"It´s maybe one of the best James Bond movies, and certainly is truly loyal to it´s novel",positive
A classic Bond film.,positive
Easily the best James Bond!,positive
Good return for a new bond,positive
"If they keep going this way with Bond Films, the unthinkable might happen: a Bond Oscar. Daniel Craig's intelligent and understated Bond is perfect, and the dialogue written for him is so sharp and captures the Bond feel without being over the top. The characters are dark, complicated and nuanced in a way that none would dream possible in a Bond film having seen the classics. Eva Green really ties this film together by being a Bond girl who is smart, independent and most unusually, an actual, human, character--she isn't just for Bond's enjoyment and even when he gets her, she isn't that simple and when she leaves, it appropriately and believably destroys him. Judi Dench is one of my favourite actresses and she is a peerless M. Overall a really great film, one of the best.",positive
Thought it was exceptionally well made and acted.A TRIUMPH.,positive
"After the absurdity of previous Bond movies, a darker, grittier take on the character is just what we needed, and just what we got with Casino Royale, one of the best Bond movies to date, with a truly fantastic performance from Daniel Craig",positive
Eva Greene is mesmerizing,positive
"The sleekest of all the Bond movies, ""Casino Royale"" is the result of a smart script that carefully analyzes its characters and their surroundings; a director that certainly knows how to handle his stuff; and Daniel Craig's excellent performance in the lead role. It's incredibly entertaining, perfectly paced and loaded with suspense.",positive
"The rebooted James Bond is thrilling, exciting, interesting, satisfying, smart, haunting, intriguing and awesome, and Craig delivers a Bond unlike any other and it works. All this, NO one saw it coming. We got them there.",positive
Good film. Great special effects. Gave James Bond an emotional side which is a welcome addition.,positive
"It kind of a reboot but it's still in the same canon as the other films...! So it's more of a prequel. But if that's true... Why isn't M a dude??? 0.0 eh the James Bond canon is all screwed up. A fresh take on James Bond that works really well!! A plot takes almost exactly from casino royale, except, one key part of the plot is changed for the better! This key part is that instead of investing in brothels and then they are outlawed.., the main villain is investing against an airplane that he intends to blow up. Offering this change from the source material is smart in that it adds more opportunity for action and adds more of a story to be told! It pretty much ensures that the first hour of the film could happen! The movie isn't as entertaining is it could be but it's pretty darn close!! 9.4 out of 10",positive
Good movie. Action and story are good.,positive
Might be my favorite Bond movie.,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery in the 60s. He is a refreshing change of pace from the cheesiness of Pierce Brosnan.,positive
Probably the best Bond fim made to date. Excellent.,positive
"A much needed reboot for the franchise. It leaves behind the gadgets and fun of previous films, but it's still a great action thriller. Violent, suspenseful, and beautifully filmed. A cheering ending leaves the film strong. Casino Royale stands out in the franchise.",positive
One of my favorite Bond movies.,positive

The best of the Craig-Bond films; it is in this movie that they truly capture the flavor of Bond perfectly. And DAMN IS IT GOOD.,negative

Casino Royale is one of my favorite movies and my favorite Bond movie. It's darker but it has it's Bond moments. It has it's references but it stands on it's own. The whole thing about Bond becoming Bond when he says it at the end when he's gotten betrayed and beaten up and all sorts of over stuff. It's spectacular.,positive
BRILLIANT EXACTLY HOW IAN FLEMING INTENDED BOND TO BE,positive
The perfect Bond film.,positive
"I would say this is the best Bond movie thus far. I really enjoyed the whole movie from start to finish. The torture scene was...torture to watch, but very well done. I would recommend to anyone over the age of 14",positive
Loved it! Great action and suspense...I did cringe though when his manhood was getting destroyed.,positive
la mejor del último Bond!,positive
"Definitely the best Bond movie so far, I haven't seen the first Casino Royale, though. Craig is the best Bond also, not so delicate, but this is what love. Brutal and breathless. Must see.",positive
"""Casino Royale"" is a true spy film with a strong human touch that delivers intelligent dialogue, fast-paced action sequences, and powerful performances.",positive
Haven't seen a Bond movie this good since Lazenby,positive
"This remains my favorite 007 James Bond film to date. Love the new reboot with the new 007. The story was great, the pacing was excellent (a little less so toward the end) and the humanizing nature of our new hero was a long time coming. Love it.",positive
Daniel Craig makes Bond that much cooler. Surpassed only by Skyfall in terms of it being the best Bond movie.,positive
They got everything right with this. Perfect Bond film.,positive
Better than Dr. No. Nuff said.,positive
NEW JAMES BOND IS DOPE,positive
"I watched this film in theaters and I wasn't impressed. It made me miss the old themes that made James Bond classic. Modernizing the franchise was making it lose its charm. However, some time has passed and after viewing Skyfall, I am willing to give this movie another chance. 3.5 stars (until I watch it again). To be concluded...",negative
"This movie has a bit of history to this. Casino Royale was actually the first Bond book by Ian Fleming, but due to copyright issues, this movie would be mad many years after the book, which is why ""Dr. No"" would come first. Anyway, this was a GREAT way to introduce me to Daniel Craig (The other being ""Cowboys & Aliens"") and Craig would remain my favorite Bond to date. Now, this movie is EASILY one of my favorites. Go see it.",positive
"One of my favourite Bond films, albeit rife with product placement.",positive
Best return to the true nature of the literary Bond!,positive
"Daniel Craig has thrown off the suave persona that has enveloped this character throughout the Brosnan and Moore era, and has breathed new life into him. He's unpredictable, he's likable, and most importantly, he is human.",negative
"A great movie overall, but the ending part would be better.",positive
A reinvention of Bond that is tougher and darker than ever before. I particularly liked Mads Mikkelsen being a truly despicable villain.,positive
A very exciting and witty movie. From the very start of the movie we get an incredible action chase scene that is very well done and entertaining. The actors and actresses all do a splendid job. Daniel Craig plays a very interesting and darker James Bond that I love. In short it is a must watch!,positive
"Great Bond, albeit a bit Bourne. Rubbish villain.",negative
"Not your typical oo7 movie, but pretty goo",negative
this made bond cool agan it put bond in the real world with a great story masterfully done Action and Daniel Craig who takes the name bond and makes it his own,positive
One of my favourite Bond movies. The fact that Bond gets beat up and appears human is terrific,positive
"When 007 needed to have new life brought into it, Daniel Craig steps up to the plate and hits a homerun. Right off the bat it becomes an excellerating thrill ride. Unlike the Pierce Brosnan series, Casino Royale is all business and plays out very well in each story arc. The suspense, action, and humor lets the story and writing reach amazing new heights in the franchise. Craig and the remaining cast are nothing short of amazing, they all make a great story even better with their acting. Case in put Casino Royale is one the best films in the franchise and a great indicator that 007 is still alive and better then ever. The names Bond. James Bond. Thanks to the brilliance of Casino Royale this legendary quote can continue to live on.",positive
"Casino Royale does an amazing job of bringing the Bond series back, and features plenty of beautiful set pieces, awesome one-liners, and incredible special effects.",positive
"I kinda got lost, probably because I don't/can't gamble, but I still enjoyed this. And I laughed at some parts . . . I won't go into detail. Pretty good, I should have started from the beginning of the series, but I'm working my way backwards, I guess.",positive
One of my favorite movies,positive
"Daniel Craig is one of the most stylish, curious, and best bond in years. Casino Royal is much better then last bond flick(s). A smart sexy action thriller. The best bond in years.",positive
"An astonishing movie, and one of the best bond movies. The action scenes were explosive, the poker game was nerve wracking, and eva greens dress showed off her ample figure! Great!",positive
"The first Bond film I watched. I enjoyed it alot. The first hour and a half was superbly paced with excellent acting and plotting, it's a shame the last hour was pretty dull.",positive
"An amazing prequel is both mesmerizing and powerful. Daniel Craig is perfect as a younger, more brutal, yet human James Bond. The opening title sequence is fantastic. The acting is great, the action scenes are astounding and the villian is memorable. One of the few bond movies that manages to capture the spirit of Fleming's character. I loved it!",positive
"Bra och underhållande action, störande att det ska utspelas före första filmen.",negative
My fav of the three daniel craig bonds out thus far because its the most action packed and he's at his hottest!,positive
"i think it took the charm out of the bond series, it was good but its not what i look for in my 007.",negative
"Andrew, I agree to agree to disagree on that(just a hair). He(Craig-san, yes, a mock-up of ""You Only Live Twice""), is am GREAT Bond to be. But, he doesn't have the LOOKS! HE'S BLOND!!!! AAAAAHHH!!!!! NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!",negative
The best Bond since Connery.,positive
Arguably one of the best Bond movies and introducing Daniel Craig in this manner was spectacular.,positive
One of my top favorite bond movies really like the realistic take on it.,positive
"By focusing on the brutalities of the man just as much as the mission, ""Casino Royale"" is a welcome reboot that more than invigorates the James Bond legacy.",positive
Easily my 2nd favorite Bond,positive
I was expecting alot worse from this but it definately pulled through,negative
"Manages to make Poker exciting, and the opening sequence and the following scene are of the best in Bond movie history.",positive
Awesome movie!! Daniel Craig is perfect as the new James Bond in his own unique way!!,positive
"kick butt movie, best Bond since Sean Connery. great revamping of the character.",positive
it was alright but long,negative
"One of best Bond movies of all time! Also, a great origin story for the character of James Bond.",positive
A new type of Bond executed perfectly.,positive
"As this was the first James Bond movie i ever saw, I count it as my favorite. And it is a great introduction for Daniel Craig as 007. I was very pleased with this movie, and it really got me hooked on the James bond series.",positive
Great Bond film. Daniel Craig did a great job.,positive
One of the best bond movies of all time. Daniel Craig has a particular swag and smoothness that fits the bond character perfectly. The movie starts off completely solid with a chance scene that will leave you completely breathless. It doesn't stop there as the story evolves and,positive
I have watched this film and I loved it lots it also compares with other Bond films aswell,positive
"Craig's outstanding debut pretty much saved the Bond series from eternal damnation by an angry God. Also saving the series is director Martin Campbell (who had already saved it in '95 with ""GoldenEye""), who experiments with realism in the way that Chris Nolan did with the Batman series. Its all a fun, exciting ride with surprising emotional depth.",positive
The first Bond film I truely enjoyed,positive
"I hadn't seen a Bond movie since GoldenEye, but this was on the hotel cable, and it wasn't too bad. I didn't buy the hetero romance, but I'm not sure that stuff was any better in the old ones.",negative
"Holy crap. This film just oozes coolness. great plot, great acting, great soundtrack, great cinematography. Badass",positive
"A 007 film to never forget, with Daniel Craig's first performance as the memorable James Bond!",positive
"Best Bond film ever made (as of 2013). Good simple plot, excellent stylish visuals and action, quality performances all round.",positive
Daniel Craig's debut as James Bond doesn't fail...excellent plot and excellent introduction to characters that will be seen and heard about in the next couple of flims...Le Chiffre was a badass villain,positive
"Nowadays, the best way to revive an established, well-loved character is to go back to his roots and trace the origins of his past. It worked for Batman Begins, and it works for Casino Royale. I love character-driven stories, and in this latest installment (which is actually a prequel of sorts) we get a peek into the events and experiences of Bond's earlier days just when he was promoted to 007 status. What he goes through in this movie molds him into the Bond that we know. To be honest, I'm not much of a Bond fan really. I mean, I've seen all of the Pierce Brosnan movies because I could, and not because I had to watch them. To be fair, they were well-made and stylishly produced like any good 007 flick should be, but too much of a good thing can still get old and bland after a while. This is the first Bond I've had some emotional attachment to mainly because of the range of feelings Daniel Craig was able to provide for the character. He's ruthlessly efficient when slugging it out with the bad guys, yet has a touch of dry British humor in certain scenes - for instance, it was funny when he was visibly annoyed after Versper picked out a dinner jacket for him. And a touch of drama too: he actually confesses his love (and says the ""L"" word!) for the leading lady in this one, as opposed to his cool and calculated seduction of the many women he has yet to meet in future trysts. Casino Royale was well-done because it was bold enough to forego the usual wisecracking Bond persona and instead present a rookie 007 who's just about to learn just how vicious his line of work really is. This a great interpretation of the famous MI6 agent who hasn't learned all the tricks in the book just yet, and is still a bit rough around the edges. He still gets the job done, but not without making some mistakes along the way that will cost him dearly.There was one shot I liked in particular which was a close up of Bond's freshly scarred face (right after thwarting a terrorist plot to blow up an airliner). This Bond has a brutality to him, which is established in the pre-credits bathroom scene where he beats an enemy's face to a bloody pulp. It's pretty obvious to anyone who has seen the movie, but it's still noteworthy to mention there are no gadgets used in this one (unless you count the skin-embedded tracking device/health monitor and defibrilator). That leaves Bond only with his wits, ammuntion and raw strength to contend with his foes in this adventure. This was bound to upset a few people I suppose. For instance, there was some moron whining on YouTube that didn't really get why they chose to discard the gizmos. On another note, I'm glad the villain (Le Chiffre) wasn't the cliche megalomaniacal mastermind planning world domination - he's just in it for the money. As refreshing as it is however, there are still some key elements that were wisely kept intact so as not to alienate the fans and retain a sense of familiarity. It wouldn't be a Bond film without the exotic locations, the cars, and of course the women, so I was thankful they kept those items in their checklist. This is getting too long so I'll cap this off with a round up of the other things I liked about the movie. First off, there's a cool twist on the traditional gunbarrel sequence by building it in to the opening credits that follow right after. This time we actually see who the ill-fated gunman is. As for the actual opening sequence itself, the stylized animation showing Bond in action departs from the usual scantily clad (or naked) women accompanying the opening credits. It's a great way of showing what ol' James is best at, and Chris Cornell's ""You Know My Name"" complements the whole sequence (and the film's overall theme in general). It blows my mind that this is the same guy that sang ""Black Hole Sun"" and ""Rusty Cage"". Cornell's voice was the last one I expected to hear in a Bond theme but his vocal range fit the song suprisingly well. Who would have known? There were a copule more scenes I liked, namely the verbal sparring between James and Vesper upon their first meeting, and the Parkour-inspired foot chase scene with the bombmaker. Oh, and my favorite line: Bartender: ""Would you like your Martini shaken or stirred?"" Bond: ""Does it look like I give a damn?""",positive
See this its amazing See t before watching Quantum of Solace,positive
definitely my favorite bond movie...ever,positive
Best bond in years great action it did the novel justice I loved it Daniel crag is the best bond since Connery I don't have words to describe how much I love this movie,positive
"Exciting, tense and a great debut for a new bond",positive
"Daniel Craig may not be the best Bond, but this proves he's up to the job.",positive
One of the best bond movies!,positive
Top 3 Bond movies of all time.... 1.) Skyfall 2.) Goldfinger 3.) Casino Royale,positive
???????Daniel Craig?????? James Bond?????Daniel????????????????????????????????????????Casino Royale????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????,positive
"This is James Bond reborn. It actually has good acting and plot, while still including everything that makes Bond, Bond.",positive
"In my opinion, this is not just the greatest Bond movie made to date, but perhaps the one of the greatest films ever made. This is the first movie I have watched in a long time that kept me transfixed on the screen, in large part due to how believable Daniel Craig is as James Bond. I was hoping this movie would never end, even after the two and a half hours I spent watching it. Once again, a great movie, and I cannot wait to see the sequels.",positive
Martin Campbell and daniel craig took james bond to a whole new level,positive
"Possibly the best of the Bond films, ""Casino Royale"" gave the series a tonal make-over, injecting modern style, intelligence and real emotion into a lagging franchise. Green elevates the role of the Bond girl with wit and charm and Craig begins his venture into becoming, arguably, the best Bond ever.",positive
Good but a little overrated.,negative
Very promising start for Daniel Craig as James bond.,negative
This movie is a great rebirth of James Bond franchise. Newcomer Daniel Craig is amazing as new looking James Bond. It is not fair to compare him to his predecessors and there is no point of doing it since we are happy with him being our hero(in my humble opinion). Movie itself is witty and stylish.,positive
"Cold, calculating, and brutal. At the same time, it is more mature and gives Bond some emotional depth. Craig proves to be a great Bond, and Eva Greene is an enchanting counterpart. I'm also glad they brought Martin Campbell back to the director's chair (They should have kept him). This may be my favorite Bond film.",positive
Casino Royale isn't simply the best Bond film in years. It is one of the best Bond films ever,positive
"I have no point of reference with which to compare Casino Royale. I've never seen a Bond movie ... up until now. I can't really say anything authoritatively. I think Daniel Craig is fantastic as Bond, but I have no comparisons to draw from. I think Eva Green is probably one of the best Bond girls, but that's entirely conjecture on my part. Still, as a post-Bourne action movie, Casino Royale is a remarkably good time! This rebooted Bond is one of those unattainably classy films, think Oceans 11 but without the occasionally goofy characters. And I like that! Action movies nowadays could use an extra dose of class every now and again. The performances are exceptional. As I mentioned above, Craig and Green are terrific! Chemistry between actors is a tricky thing, but the two leads deliver it in spades! Mads Mikkelsen plays a chilling foil to Bond. Judi Dench is as reliable as always. And Jeffery Wright lends his talents in a smaller supporting role. The cast offers nothing in the way of flaws. The action is surefooted and confident. There is an awesome free-running chase near the beginning. The scene offers little bearing on the rest of the movie, but it's still exhilarating to watch! There is a lengthy and impressive action scene in Miami International Airport. But I wouldn't say this is an action-centric movie. The pacing could be problematic. And there's no denying that Casino Royale is a tad too long. Poker games take up the majority of the middle portion of the film. But it's incredible who tense director Martin Campbell keeps these scenes. The main flaw present is the shifting villainy. At the beginning, there is a very clear villain. Then he's out of the picture, and character B becomes the main baddie. Then that washes out, and character C comes on the scene. A little definition would be nice. Also of special note, the music is amazing! Chris Cornell's inspired Bond song sets the tone right from the get-go! And David Arnold's score never ceases to astound - in the action scenes and in the quieter, more introspective moments. Casino Royale: one of the most classy, flashy, and engaging action movies yielded from mid-2000's. The other Daniel Craig movies in this series are now, most definitely, on my want-to-see-list! Mr. Bond, it was a pleasure meeting you. ""I won't consider myself to be in trouble until I start weeping blood."" 8.5/10",positive
My favorite of all the Daniel Craig Bond movies,positive
"Reinvents the Bond franchise. Gone are most of the cheesy lines and elaborate deaths. In their place is a competent, human hero reminiscent of Jason Bourne. All the villains die ""normal"" villain deaths (no bowler hats or lasers here).",positive
"A fast paced, cool action film. I enjoyed it much more than Skyfall. Casino Royale was actually really good. I thought Daniel Craig was great. I was very entertained.",positive
"The best James Bond movie of them all, and the best action movie of the decade. Daniel Craig is a revelation as the ""blunt instrument"" that does the jobs nobody else will do, and the dark, emotional, unflinching journey of a man giving up his soul for the greater good is powerful stuff. Vesper Lynd is probably the best female character to ever show up in an action film (Although it's sad how seldom few there are vying for that position). She is Bond's equal in intelligence and cleverness, their back-and-forth quippery is made of the same substance as Tracy and Hepburn. Plus you've got a creepy villain, brutal fight sequences impeccably shot, the masterful poker game sequence... The list goes on. Martin Campbell's direction is assured, and the score is impressively restrained in being entirely focused on the journey of the character rather than giving us empty moments of fan service recognition. The best scene in the film is quiet and simple, in which Bond comforts a traumatized Vesper as they sit on the floor of the hotel shower. It was Campbell's decision to change the script and keep them fully clothed, and in doing so, what would have been a cliche and easy bit of sexual eye-candy instead becomes a transcendent moment of love and compassion. That's the kind of beautiful subtly of character and theme that is all too rare in explosive action movies, and ""Casino Royale"" shows that the two do not need to be mutually exclusive.",positive
"Slick, sharp, and classic. The stunts are exhilarating and the action sequences take you to the edge of your seat. In a reboot that showcases Bond in his most human form yet.",positive
"No he visto las peliculas antiguas asi que no podria compararlas, pero si me parece mucho mejor que las protagonizadas por Pierce Brosnan.",negative
It's good to see Bond films take a different direction to be more (for lack of a better word) gritty.,negative
"A new Bond and a new take on the character. Surprisingly, Craig is so fantastic in this role that he actually comes close to being better than Connery.",positive
The best Bond and the best bond film ever.,positive
"EXCELLENT reboot to a franchise that was not taken seriously and became very campy. A serious and ""realistic"" approach to Bond. Well acted out. Very good, well written, smart and darker story with twists and turns. The action is on point. The direction is great as well. Daniel Craig brings a much more arrogant, brutal but human version of Bond that hasn't been seen before. His charisma shines through. All the supporting characters are well written and acted out just as well. The beginning of the new Bond for a new generation starts with this movie and it starts in the best, most perfect way that it could have.",positive
Best Casino Royale ever.,positive
"After a long 44 years since Dr No and Sean Connery, our 6th and best 007 has arrived to give us the really serious British intelligence action thriller and shine that made CIA seemed like a poor retarded cousin. Unlike his predecessors, Daniel Craig is the best Bond by light years. With more substance, brains, realism than style, Daniel Crag with the help of 21st century technology, omega watch, a smart car and Sony gadgets, I was treated to the the best 007 ever. Strong, intelligent, gutsy and striking fear in people with his piercing blue eyes, Daniel Craig was a non-stop adrenaline pumper. Interestingly, Casino Royale was actually the first Ian Fleming´s first adventure of the 007 series. One learned of James Bond´s pre-007 mission that led to his promotion to the coveted 007 status. We also learned that he was not always the flippant womaniser who shunned long term relationship. Also his invention of the famous Vodka Martini cocktail was revealed plus the full recipe recited to a waiter taking orders while he was at the Baccarat table. Unlike the clownish and unserious tone of previous 007 films, Casino Royale was very gritty from the get go and also very painful to watch at times. James Bond certainly had a very high threshold for pain and so it should be if he was to be trusted with national secrets of the highest level. Nice to see James Bond had his spell of domesticity and inebriation with love. It was the first of the two tragic love stories for James Bond and would forever change his attitude towards women of the beautiful and sexy kind probably forever.",positive
"Rebooting the 47 year James Bond franchise with Ian Flemings´first adventure, the new interpretation of our hero was a complete rejuvenation to say the least.´Light years apart from all the 20 earlier 007 films, Casino Royale took the lead as the best as at year 2007. Stripped of corny CGIs, the stunt actions were amazingly heart stopping. Unlike his predecessors, Daniel Craig is one Bond with more substance, agility, endless stamina, brains and pain tolerance. His chemistry with Judi Dench (M) was magic. It was clearly obvious, she commanded respect from 007. Very few do. Otherwise his arrogance, cavalier spirit and punch lines injected superb LOL humour. Strong, intelligent, gutsy and strikes fear in people with his piercing blue eyes.. Never a dull moment in this nearly 2.5 hours long film Very gritty and painful to watch at times. One thinks James Bond has a very high threshold for pain yet maintaining his sense of humour even when his manhood was severely threatened.. Nice to see James Bond has his spell of domesticity and inebriation with love. Although it did end tragically and explained his flippant desire of one night stands with future female encounters (save for Her Majesty Service where he met his next tragic love story). If you had paid attention, you would also have learnt the recipe to James Bond´s signature cocktail, the vodka martini. Why it should be drunk shaken and not stirred remains to be discovered.",positive
"one of my favorite bond films. The poker is a bit slow, but the tension and build-up during those scenes is really why I enjoy this movie so much.",positive
I love the action sequences and the plot is gripping (If a bit confusing) The love part between Bond and Vesper kind of bored me though,positive
Craig bought a new aged more rugged Bond. One exposed with flaws before he received his 00 status.,positive
"Hands down best 007 movie I have seen so far. Haven't seen Quantum Of Solace or Skyfall yet, but this movie gives me the notion that both will be spectacular. Daniel Craig makes a great James Bond, and the writers did a wonderful job with the storytelling. Had a lot of unexpected twists, with great action scenes, and Eva Green did a good job as supporting actress.",positive
This is the best James Bond Yet! Daniel Craig kicks ass!,positive
"Kinetic, Thrilling, Haunting, Tautly-Paced and Being Deadly Serious, Casino Royale is a masterfully crafted entertaining comeback of the iconic spy character humanized and intensely driven by Daniel Craig.",positive
"Craig is the best bond ever, in my opinion, i hope the rest of the Bond movies he stars in will keep me on the edge of my seat like this one.",positive
"I prefer it more than Skyfall, though they are both excellent.",positive
"I've seen this movie about five times. I still don't understand a little bit of it, but I get more into it when I watch it again.",positive
Craig makes a great Bond,positive
"A much needed change from the campy, gadget-filled Bonds of old, Casino Royale brings out the dark, intense Bond we have all been waiting for.",positive
Daniel Craig is such a great actor,negative
"Great movie, Bond is the man, the cold side of Bond shows in this movie!",positive
"pretty solid. starts strong, finishes long. kind of gets slow in the middle. never trust a ho.",positive
Story seemed a little long but great start for Craig.,positive
"Insiste em adicionar baitolagens no Bond. E insiste em terminar de forma errada. Tudo, tudo depois da surra nas bolas tá errado. E Bond abraçadinho no chuveiro... É dose. Mas é muito divertido. E abriu caminha para Skyfall acontecer. Já que Quantum nunca existiu.",positive
WOW! great action and thrills. The Best Bond yet!!,positive
A good come back for 007!,positive
amazing first 15 minutes then a lot of gambling in the middle . then better at the end,positive
"Daniel Craig's debut outing as 007 is perhaps the best Bond movie since the days of Connery. It's a reboot, so Bond is just getting his license to kill. This movie shows a back-to-basics Bond, after the cartoonish excessiveness of the Brosnan era. Craig takes full control of the role, bringing a Bond that is more serious, grim and reckless, while maintaining a very dark sense of humor. He's also much more aggressive. Whereas Sean Connery moved like a cat, Craig moves like a bulldozer. Timothy Dalton's desire to portray a more serious Bond was only partially successful. Here, Craig finishes the job.",positive
Best Bond movie ever!,positive
This is one of the greatest bond movies I've ever seen!,positive
I didn't want to see this at all. I didn't want to like Daniel Craig and I didn't want to like the revision of the Bond franchise. I was dragged against my will to see it. Thank goodness!,negative
Terrific a very good movie,positive
This movie will never define James Bond. But its still damn good in every way.,positive
"Wow. This film just about had it all. An awesome cast, an outstanding lead role by Daniel Craig. This film did exceed my expectations. I loved just about everything about its mysterious and action-packed chemistry, the storyline was amazing as well. I was also pleased with how Craig did becoming the new bond of a new generation. This movie didn't disappoint whatsoever. Grade A material.",positive
"Entretenida, buena accion, actuaciones, etc. Muy recomendable.",positive
"The acting is great for an action film, the plot good, the action good, and a just a good overall story!",positive
"This is by far, the best James Bond movie EVER. Also, it's one of my favorite movies ever. This is why I spend 9 bucks to see movies!",positive
One of the best bonds ever!,positive
Best 007 film for ages.,positive
"One of the greatest reboots of all time, Casino Royale successfully introduced daring grit, a brilliant new Bond, and surprising emotion. An absolute success.",positive
probably the worst bond film ever and daniel craig is the worst bond ever. 2 hours spent watching someone play poker with only 4 action scene's is rubbish. if i wanted to watch someone play poker i would just watch Challenge TV,negative
"A good comeback for 007. Though I love Pierce Brosnan, he was getting a little cheesy for me, and not like a Roger Moore cheesy.",positive
violent and gripping :),positive
"The transition from Peirce Brosnan to Danial Craig proved to be excellent. Bond becoming 007, the chase in Madagascar, the epic casino royale battle, Bond learning not to trust anyone, and bringing back the 64 Aston Martin DB5, Daniel Craig could not have started his career off any other way!",positive
I would say its Pretty Fucking Awesome!!! Beginning to End. This is one of my favorite Bond films (Especially after being born in the 90's and having Pierce as your Generation's James Bond),positive
Having watched this movie again i have come to the conclusion that this is my favorite Bond film because of how it added the dark and mature tone to the Bond franchise and how well it is executed!,positive
Kids want to watch a great action movie... 007 is the answer!,positive
"Thoroughly entertaining. Great action sequences, nice plot thought not mind-bendingly deep, great acting. A really dark and moody modernised take on the Bond role. For me one of, if not THE, best Bond movies ever. I wasn't really looking forward to seeing Daniel Craig in the James Bond role ... here is me eating humble pie, he doesn't act it, he owns it!",positive
"Grade - A+ My favourite Bond movie to date, 'Casino Royale' has stunning action sequences, great performances and excellent direction from Martin Campbell.",positive
"After seeing ""Skyfall"", I now have more of an appreciation for this film.",positive
By far the best Bond film ever made starring anyone!,positive
"Best Bond. And best Aston Martin, the DBS.",positive
I will keep this one very close to me. The urge of seeing it again will strike again for sure. A favorite.,positive
Great restart to the Bond franchise!,positive
"After the silly acting, mediocre scripts or flat direction and the unnecessary gadgetry of recent bond films and after having to endure the goofy i-don't-know-the-cast-except-Woody-Allen 1967 unofficial ""parody"" version of the book of Fleming. ""Casino Royale"" is a reinvention and renovation of the 007 franchise, with Craig assumes the role formerly as the new Bond that's more realistic and human, the new and better reinvention of 007: a caustic, haunted and intense, like a Bond that should be. Green's act of Vesper, marked her as one of the best performances of the Bond girls, with great strength and elegance. Dench still acting like a jewel as M, and Mikkelsen are a great villain. It shows a seriousness during the movie, with intense (and surprising) action scenes, typical of the director of ""Goldeneye"", Martin Campbell. ""Casino Royale"" is a smart, stylish and thrilling reboot of the Bond franchise, with an haunted and intense brand new 007, just like fans and normal audience wanted. But beware, its sequel doesn't overcomes this marvelous film.",positive
"The grittiest Bond of them all. Amazing action sequences, tense moments at the gambling table, and 007 getting tortured?! What a complete breath of fresh air after Pierce Brosnan almost made me completely quit the franchise. Also just when you think its over, theres one final twist. Loved this movie from start to finish, every minute.",positive
"http://expletivedleted.livejournal.com/149977.html Well hellooooo there James Blonde, er, I mean, Bond. Daniel Craig, I have been waiting for you. Pre-project, one of the main reasons I usually named Craig as my favorite was because he was simply the one that stuck with me most. But now, having really watched his predecessors, he's still my boy. The quick reason is that I like how much darker his films are. He's more ruthless. He's got his sense of humor, but it's much more biting and sarcastic. He unapologetically defies authority. His storylines are more personal. There's more at stake for him, and thus you see his defenses are up. Every other Bond took a few films to distinguish themselves. Craig nailed his own completely different interpertation right away, while at the same time staying true to some of the basics of the character. I remember the first time I saw Casino Royale. It would be the first 007 I saw in the theater. It was Thanksgiving day, and I had just enough time to run to the movies before I had to get my green bean casserole in the oven before dinner with friends. I expected to find the place filled with dads and their kids, trying to keep the kitchen clear for mom. There weren't quite as many as I'd expected, but those familial units were certainly present. Something else that struck me when I first watched this back then was that it seemed that the people behind 007 finally realized something: girls watch these movies too! Let's face it. James Bond is very much a man's man. The way he kicks butt and beds women, there's no denying that it's been all guys running the show. For once, they threw a little eye candy our way, again with an obvious nod to Honey Ryder. He's also not as blatant of a womanizer. Sure, he has the affair with the married girl (unhappily married, I might add), but you at least start getting some background on him and understand why he has these tendencies. But his relationship with Vesper is a lot more real, than any we've seen except maybe with Tracy in On Her Majesty's... It had been getting annoying how quickly girls would throw themselves at him (especially in Connery's time). Nice that he's actually gotta work for it a bit now. Also, did you notice that except for the quick image of Vesper, there's no women prancing around in the opening credits? More on that later. Til this point, every time we've changed actors, we've just sorta picked up the story where we left off. Casino Royale is the first reboot the franchise. Or really, you could argue that it's not actually a reboot, more of a rewind. We never really did get an origin story. Even then, it's only a partial origin story in that it's his first mission. We don't know how he got there, but then again it's maybe better that way. We don't get a ""Bond. James Bond"" until the last seconds of the film, but that point, he is definitively Bond. James Bond. And it's beautiful. Now that we're past 20 movies in, there's so many pieces to the franchise, and I love seeing all of the winks to the audience. Some more obvious than others. Obvious: ""Would you like that shaken or stirred"" ""Does it look like I give a damn"". Less obvious: Have you noticed he has a favorite brand of champagne? That would be Bollinger. Or the throwback to the silly Bond girl names by trying to give Vesper the alias ""Stephanie Broadchest"". I love Eva Green as Vesper Lynd. She doesn't have a flimsy, based on intense experience connection with him. Instead she really does get thru and connects with him. Their first interaction might be my favorite scene. Such sharp dialog back and forth. Skewered. I'd been saying how much I love Judi Dench as M. With Brosnan, I just liked her for the fact that she was more hands on. But with Craig, I love the kind of relationship that they have. He's so insubordinate and arrogant, but at the same time there's a deep level of mutual respect. I'm really excited to watch the next couple (Skyfall especially) with these interactions fresher in my head. Also, here's where we ""first"" meet Felix Leiter of the CIA. The first time I saw this, I got the sense that he was important, I just didn't know my 007 history enough to know how. Now I get it. Been throwing around the phrase ""one of my favorites"" when talking about the various theme songs. However, I figured out how to narrow it down. If I could only listen to one theme ever again, which would it be. Immediately my brain went to Chris Cornell's ""You Know My Name"". Yes, this one is definitely my favorite. I may even think so about the credit sequence as well. It plays on the whole casino theme and instead of featuring dancing naked girls, there's some really cool stylized fight sequences. I like it because A)it's different and 2) it brings the focus to James. Makes it feel like it's more a part of the movie and not just an afterthought. http://www.expletivedleted.com http://www.twitter.com/expletivedleted http://www.facebook.com/expletivedleted",positive

I rent this movie after I saw Skyfall. This movie is still entertaining. I like Skyfall more than this one for sure.,positive
james blonde = bland. Good action movie but the Craigsters Smirk throughout is slightly off putting.,negative
"-IGNORE THIS ""OUT OF FIVE"" RATING 3.5/4 Gone is the conventional plots, gone is the silly gadgetry, and gone is the cheesy one-liners, here arrives this gripping, heart-pounding reboot to the 007 series with Craig (a remarkable new Bond) assigned to stop a weapons dealer at a casino . . . but it's not nearly as simple. Filled with nitroglycerin in the great tradition of action films, thanks to expert pacing, thrilling action (including a hair raising parkour chase, and phenomenal sequence on stairs), great opening scene, and a sensational wrap-up. Goes on a bit longer than it should, but a film with this much excitement demands a watch. Sequel: QUANTUM OF SOLACE.",positive
"If there was ever a bod film to bring the franchise back with a breath of fresh air its this movie. If you have watched it, well watch it again and if you haven't watched it then what are you waiting for?",positive
This movie defines how Bond reinvigorated itself! Daniel Craig is the best bond! And please don't say Pierce Brosnan!,positive
The best James Bond film of all time!,positive

An excellent action packed and suspenseful bond joy ride,positive
"Called ""James Bland"" by the British press, Daniel Craig had the last laugh. Casino Royale is brilliant in writing and in its action sequences, but Craig`s performance as a tough and fearless James Bond is just unmatched.",positive
"Really invigorated the franchise my only issue is that I got a bit bored in act 111, didn't realise it was the finale!",negative

A triumphant and worthy return to a franchise that has long since been played by mediocrity.,positive
Pretty good movie but not a bond like movie.,positive
Pretty good movie but not a bond like movie.,positive
"Craig is fantastic as Bond, and this vehicle is an origin story of sorts for 007. James is new to MI:6 and can't seem to keep himself out of trouble. The opening 20 minutes is a foot chase that outdoes nearly any other Bond movie action sequence. His banter with M, his chemistry with Eva Green as the sexy-smart Vesper Lynd, and a horrendus torture scene where chief villian, Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) repeatedly whacks Bond in the you-know-whats with a knotted rope make this a terrific installment in the 007 catalogue.",positive
Eva Green is my lady crush. Love her till the end of the world/,negative
"Daniel Craig's first role as Bond, and its well made.",positive
participants? real life dangerous people,positive
"Craig decided to put meaning in Bond's character shying away from all the campiness and tricks of previous Bond films. If this were the first bond film, no other film would have thought to compete.",positive
The best James Bond film of all time!,positive
"Great Movie..Lots of Action, Daniel Craig is Kool.. Can't wait to see were this James Bond takes this series...",negative
Still the best bond film even before skyfall,positive
"Est-ce que je peux vraiment juger un style et un personnage mythique que je n'aime pas ? Un long et pénible moment de cinéma... Pour moi, évidemment.",negative
freaking awesome. no q though,positive
"Best Bond movie in recent years. All of the acting is really good and it has some damn fine action in it, too. Better than the last two Brosnan Bonds, thats for sure.",negative
"not realistic, but then again when are bond movies ever realistic",positive
"Pretty much kicks ass. The last third of the movie has serious problems, but by far a great reboot of the series. Edit: In hindsight, this movie sucks. Here's to the second being better.",positive
"Bond's essential 21st century reboot is expertly orchestrated and potently thrilling, although I wonder if it may have pressed itself a bit too far in an effort to feel contemporary. The parkour and hold'em scenes in particular already feel out-of-touch, with both fads freshly occupying the rear-view mirror, but that's hardly a fresh hurdle for the series to clear. Daniel Craig makes for a far better Bond than I'd hoped, especially during the nail-biting action scenes or the prerequisite mingling with the high-cultured elite. He isn't the quip-slinging lady killer that Connery or Brosnan were, at least not yet, but he's twice as convincing when the time comes to flex a little muscle (or leap from one precariously-perched construction crane to another, as it were). This isn't a perfect effort - the poker climax is recklessly telegraphed, and the final forty minutes feel like a weepy, long-winded epilogue - but it is an action joyride, stuffed with clever winks and nods at the character's past, and one of the best Bonds ever made.",positive
"Welcome back, James!",positive
"This is Bond at his toughest. Daniel Craig's 007 is a one-man wrecking crew. He's practically a superhero, smashing through walls, fighting multiple baddies at once and keeping up with vehicles on foot. None of the earlier Bond films come close to portraying a Bond this unpolished and brutal. The story is entertaining and easy to follow. The villain Le Chiffre is not threatening until a torture scene wipes out any sympathy he may have generated from his predicament with the even bigger fish he is working for. There are a number of memorable action scenes, primarily the opening chase scene where 007 pursues a man with a bomb on foot. It's jaw-dropping and the stunts are amazing. I'm not much of a card player, but I have to say, even the card playing scenes were exciting. A minor quibble I have is that the closing fight in Venice doesn't stand up as well when compared to the other great action pieces throughout the film. Arguments could easily be made that this is the best Bond film ever.",positive
"Okay, this guy is no Sean Connery (he seems more like a villain that Connery would have fought), but what he is, is a gritty ""hands on"" James Bond. Daniel Craig has made fans of many people with his last couple of Bond films. And guess what? I'm one of them! Cheers to you, Mr Craig.",positive
I really don't get this one...,negative
Best Bond Movie till date!,positive
'Casino Royale' is the most artistic endeavor of the franchise.,positive
"Podríamos decir que 2006, 2007 y 2008 fueron los años en los que directores de un calibre malo, normal o que simplemente no parezcan tener una película muy buena o una obra maestra logran alcanzar o aproximarse mucho a esos niveles. Sí, hubieron otros que hicieron lo mismo en años pasados, pero estos tres años son los más destacados en ese aspecto. Martin Campbell empieza dicho ""factor sorpresa"" con Casino Royale, otorgando al público una mezcla de la inteligencia de 'Desde Rusia con amor', la realización espectacular de 'Goldfinger', la modernización de 'GoldenEye' y ciertas innovaciones, entre ellas explorar el lado humano de Bond. Todo ello, junto con una majestuosa forma de representarlo, da como resultado una obra maestra. ¿El único fallo? Pasar de escenas de acción llenas de adrenalina al desarrollo de la historia y viceversa. Aún así, felicidades, Campbell y Craig, por ofrecernos este espectáculo del que muchos directores de cine de acción tienen que aprender.",positive
A really good bond film.,positive
One of the best Bond movies in recent history.,positive
"I love this one. It got rid of the campiness of Die Another Day and A View to a Kill, and gave us a more serious and darker twist on the series.",positive
A much grittier Bond. Betting every guy who wathced it crossed there legs near the end. You know what im tlaking about.,positive
"As a huge Bond fan, I feel this is one of the best and smartest Bond's made to date. He is more focused on the job itself, and you get a better idea of who Bond is and why he is the way he is.",positive
probably the only bond movie that i was completely satisfied with.,positive
"My favorite thing about Casino Royale is how it builds a great deal of excitement outside of the action sequences. The action scenes are spectacular - don't get me wrong. Everyone and their mother has already talked about the amazing opening Parkour chase scene. But what really stood out to me was how invested I was into the actual card game. The game of cat and mouse between Bond and Le Chiffre at the card table was perfectly tense and suspenseful. I also love the way this film plays around with age old Bond traditions. The twist on the opening gun barrel sequence felt fresh while still keeping true to the Bond formula. And holding off the famous ""Bond. James Bond."" line until the very end was like the producers saying, ""Daniel Craig is a whole different beast... but he's still James Bond."" My only gripe? The love story. Humanizing bond was a good choice - but some of the lines he drops to Vesper in the third act are downright stomach churning. It's not unbearable by any means but I found myself rolling my eyes a few times. Bottom line though: this is one of the better Bonds. You know, the kind that actually stands up well to all films. Not just a ""Good for a Bond movie"" kind of way.",positive
You do like the pick up scene don't you?,positive
"I don't like James Bond. I just don't see the appeal. Daniel Craig is good, it's all good...for a Bond film, but I don't like them and I don't know why!",negative
The best Bond since Goldfinger.,positive
"The Bond franchise was tired. The problem was that it was too familiar. Die Another Day tired to fix the problem by adding to it, like adding Poochie to Itchy and Scratchy. The solution was to strip James Bond bare. Hire an actor who looked nothing like the iconic Bond and make it about the character. This is the first time I cared more about James Bond than I did about the stunts, girls, and action.",positive
awesome movie full of action,positive
WORST BOND GIRL EVER,positive
"One of the best action movies ever made, with possibly the best opening scene in a movie.",positive
"A very surprisingly good Bond movie. I liked this one because this time Bond isn't a pretty boy. They also humanized him a lot which is a first for Bond movies. This movie is kind of long and drawn out, but is still very much worth watching if you're a Bond fan.",positive
We are back to the good old Sean Connery Bond days...with a bond that is a little less than perfect.,positive
"Love it! An awesome work of art with a ton of complexity, great characters, exciting, diverse and the best Bond I've seen - well done!",positive
"The rebirth of James Bond as an anti-hero, this film is a happy new beginning for 007, portrayed by a new actor, the cold Daniel Craig, as a new man with a dark past. This story actually dares to dig in on the dramatic events that led to his cold heartedness, and mixes it with the usual mix of cool action sequences, strange futuristic gadgets and glamorous beautiful women. Apart from the slow spots, this is an ideal reinvention of the James Bond on the 21st century.",positive
blude awesome best film ive seen all winter,positive
"Pretty good but kinda confusing. it was about then 007 first got his 00 license but they had all this MODERN technology (cell phones, electronic trackers etc) and they even mentioned 9/11! Other than that, I liked the action.",negative
One of the best james bond films ever,positive
"Amazing Bond movie! Explores Bond's origin. Great performances by new Bond Daniel Craig (grew up with Pierce Brosnan Bond). Vesper, played by Eva Green, Bond's ""Irene Adler"" in a way, makes the movie: witty, smart, beautiful, worthy opposing role of Bond.",positive
"It's not that it is a realistic film, it's that these larger than life characters are realistic. Bond isn't a simple thug for HMSS, Vesper isn't an ice queen and none of the mission makes you feel as though 007 should eschew life insurance due to a lack of danger.",positive
"Solidly saucy bond flick, somewhat slow however. Craig's performances are better in his other Bond films.",positive
Had this film at my work. Good film.,positive
Probably the best Bond film ever.,positive
Daniel Craig is best Bond (IMHO).,negative
Sin duda la mejor de la serie...,positive
"Bond was getting trashy, this put some testosterone back into the role.",positive
"Casino Royale gave us something that had been missing from Bond for decades - an incarnation of the hero who undergoes a genuine character arc. Seeing 007 with all his flaws and strengths laid absolutely bare is a breathtaking experience, and one which set the benchmark for action films in the 21st century.",positive
A brilliant story narrated with brilliant performances from all actors involved. Bond is back and better than ever.,positive
"""I've got a little itch, down there. Would you mind?"" That made me crack up so hard during an intense part of the movie.",positive
I liked the story and how suspenseful it was. Just wish they brought Q back.,negative
The best Bond movie ever (even till 2013). Craig has the right attitude and physique. The plot is twisted and unpredictable. The characters are deep and complicated. This raises the bar for Bond.,positive
One of the best James Bond in a long time. Are we back to a more human and charming franchise?,positive
James Bond get all the women and kill people. He get good gadget.,negative
Bond is back and better than ever! What a rush!,positive
Frakking sweet. I hope they keep up the level of quality with the franchise.,positive
"action packed, a different twist on bond",positive
"Ok so it took me a while to get round to watching it but so glad I did eventually. Brilliant film. Different and yet typical Bond. Daniel Craig is perfect in the role..all the gadgets, fights, flirting and humour still there yet it seemed to have more depth. Really good.",positive
"Best bond film to date. I know we were all worried Craig wouldn't cut it, but seriously he gives (dare I say it) Connery a run for his money, and he definitely makes Brosnan look like a wuss. In this film Craig portrays the young blunt Bond perfectly, no cheesy bar pick-up lines, no retarded villains trying to destroy the world, in fact there weren't even any naked women dancing around the screen during the opening credits! This is definitely a different kind of bond film and they did it well. See it!",negative
"Loved this movie, i bought it and the soundtrack",positive
NOT THAT GOOD NO GAGETS,negative
best james bond movie period!,positive
i think its the best bond film yet was stunning,positive
Man I loved this new griitty Bond!,positive
"A waste of time really because if you want something more cerebral and gritty, you shouldn't even be thinking about seeing a James Bond movie. It's rubbish to label this as a thinking person's blockbuster, because it has all the usual preposterousness and yet has a languid ennui that will put off fans of the franchise. Mads Mikkelsen, one of my favourite actors, plays a less over the top baddie than usual and there is an attempt to paint the characters in shades of grey. These attempts fail and this is evidenced by the return to high camp Bondery one sees in Skyfall. Probably about time to put the series out of its misery but of course there's too much money in it for Heineken and company while more important, homespun movies struggle to get made.",negative
Best Bond film I have ever seen!,positive
"Bond's best outing in years cemented Daniel Craig as one of the finest actors to ever portray the super spy. A monolithic intensity familiar to fans of Fleming's novels, forsaking a lot of the series' hitherto playfulness in favour of a serious, real and touchingly human 007 story. Yet, it still has all the high-octane thrills and dry British wit that we expect and love from good ole James. Bravo.",positive
One of the best bond movies!,positive
This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and brings back the greatness of Bond.,positive
This is how you reboot a franchise. Excellent.,positive
"Even though there are no gadgets, this movie is still a good reboot film to the Bond franchise.",positive
Would have liked to see more hands actually played.,negative
Fantastic movie with a ton of story in it.,positive
Best bond film so far. Stylishly done and a lot more sinister than its previous predecessors.,positive
"A new look at franchise, Cambell tried to revitalise 007 with the new approach, but fails to deliver strong script. Also Craig was never a good choice for a new James Bond. Why not Clive Owen?",negative
"Vesper Lynd: Doesn't it bother you? Killing all these people? James Bond: Well, I wouldn't be very good at my job if I did. A very good movie for the World's greatest spy, James Bond (aka agent 007). I'd have to say that Daniel Craig's performance as Bond was actually pretty good and he really gave the character a more serious personality, kinda what Christian Bale brought to Batman when he played the character in the the dark knight films.",positive
"Very impressive installment into the 007 franchise. Rich in both acting, style, and story line.",positive
possibly best bond film? and best bond?,positive
Great Bond film! Daniel Craig nails it!,positive
"Bond at his very best. Casino Royale is the best Bond movie ever made, despite my preference to Skyfall. This movie is intense, filled with amazing action, and has a fantastic emotional core. This movie never stops moving until the end, and they got everything right. The Bond song is fantastic, Daniel Craig as James Bond is phenomenal, Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre is an amazing Bond villain, and Eva Green's Vesper Lynd is the best Bond girl ever put on screen. The score is fantastic, and the practical action scenes shoot this movie to new levels of great. It slows at the end for a second, but it never loses my attention in the many times I have watched this movie. I prefer Skyfall because I love every scene in that movie, and it never slows down for me. At times, Casino Royale can slow for me, but it never loses my attention. The first act is action packed, the second act is brutally tense, and the third act is heartbreaking. The movie ties together as the best Bond movie ever made, and it has only Skyfall to compete with. 9.5/10",positive
"enthralling , wonderful classy bond film the fans have been hoping for Batman Begins :Batman :: Casino Royale: Bond, that is to say resurrection of a dead franchise",positive
Really liked this one! Daniel Craig made Bond interesting for me again.,negative
Brilliant action and awesome story by bond yet again. Enjoy the flawless performance by Daniel Craig!,positive
"You have to see this movie for 2 reason. if you're a Bond fan, you will fell warm and fuzzy throughout, knowing that Mr. Craig has nailed it. Or, If you hate Bond, watch this and be converted.",positive
Everything I wanted. Spectacular.,positive
without doubt the best james bond i've seen class,positive
"an improvement to Bond film, but still not spectacular enough...",negative
Solving many problems that people had with the bond series. This modern reboot is as entertaining as it is clever,positive
awesome movie must see,positive
It was an amazing fresh start for the character and the franchise.,positive
"I actually hated this when I first watched, maybe I missed Pierce Brosnan... After watching it again several years later I asked myself, ""What was I thinking?"" this is a great Bond flick, probably the best. Watch it. It is way better than Skyfall by the way; that is an over rated Bond movie.",positive
The best Bond By Far!!,positive
"Casino Royale is a fresh perspective of the 007 series, by turning the iconic character into a serious human being (thanks to an outstanding portrayal by Mr. Craig) in this nicely crisp reboot of the newly welcomed Bond series.",positive
"Una de esas películas que mantiene entretenido de principio a fin. Las actuaciones bien realizadas, la historia mmmm buena también, y el nuevo bond mucho más convincente que el anterior. Recomendable.",positive
totaly wkd but a sht ending,positive
"This new Bond definetly gave a impulse and rejuvenation to the franchise. The last Brosnan's film was disappointing and ludicrous and we needed new ideas to save the saga. Craig is a vigorous, healthy and strong character but also one of the most heart-breaked Bond, cheated and fooled by the love of a woman. We were used to see Bond hooking up with several women treathing them like sexual objects but not in this one. On the other hand, the plot is credible and the action scenes are really spectacular and innovative.",positive
"An old-school, fun, smart re-run of the beloved Bond franchise.",negative
cool but not the original,negative
"Almost perfectly Bond. Stylish, action packed, and a whole lot of fun.",positive
Good action movie but not the 007 kind of movie.,negative
I really liked this movie - definitely the best Bond in recent memory.,positive
This reboot transforms Bond in a credible human being and a professional parkour athlete.,positive
"Great addition to the Bond film series even as a reboot. Craig did an amazing job as Bond and I can't really see anyone else in the role and Judi Dench as M does a great job as well. The film is darker and grittier and adds a sense of realism to the film and the main villain is someone people can understand and possibly identify with and that makes him a great addition to the film. Bond is humanized in the film and he's defiantly not ever in any sense of control of the film and that's great! It makes us care about him and what happens to him, that's awesome that he's not just kicking butt and taking names assassin but he's a person to! Great job by everyone in the film.",positive
"not a bond fan, but man!",positive
"Daniel Craig does a hell of a job filling 007's shoes to the point where he pops into my head whenever i hear someone say James Bond. This Bond is more of a ruthless agent rather then a lovable playboy, he really puts fear into his enemies. The action scenes were thrilling, the stunts were really cool, the women were sexy as always, and the way the characters related to each other was hard not to watch (especially Bond and M). The only minor disappointment I had was the fast pacing of the last act.",positive
holy moly that guy is soooooo hot I loved this movie i recomend it to everyone,positive
"Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel and Daniel Craig's first outing brings James Bond back to life in this reboot of the James Bond that followed the postmodern reboot trend Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins started and is marvelous adventure that matches. This James Bond character who has psychological issues and needs as in the Ian Fleming novels (that always tended to not be shown in the past films). Yes this James Bonds can get hurt and end up in the hospital as he does in many of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels. Gone are the lousy the dime a dozen Bond Girl that ended up being more of a lousy character in past, which always irked me through Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan era, for an actresses in Eva Green that makes James Bond 007 prove his worth.",positive
"I like this movie because it knows every single facet of the Bond character, and gives us realistic examples of the effect he has on his surroundings.",positive
"Nothing to worry about. Casino Royale is a damn good movie. Old school, low tech, in your face action, brutal fistfights, stunning women, and a solid performance by Mr. Craig. Welcome back James.",positive
It wasnt the best james bond but its hard to live up to the others,negative
"Not one of the best Bond movies, but definitely an upgrade over the last few Pierce Brosnan flicks. Daniel Craig does a great job, but the plot has a few holes that need patching. Bond defeats his nemesis through a card game, which is kind of boring. But there is plenty of action interspersed throughout (and one fairly brutal torture scene), so it makes it worth a view. Again, Craig does a great job with this reinvention of James Bond, and I'm excited to see the other two Bond films he's starred in.",negative
I could watch this movie over and over again!,positive
One of the best Bond films ever made.,positive
Good but a cliffhanger,positive
"After many years of dismal disappointment, we finally have the Bond we were looking for, both cinematically and also in Daniel Craig, who's proven himself to be one of the best Bonds ever. Brilliant set pieces and action sequences make this very enjoyable. Welcome back, Mr. Bond.",positive
"People might disagree, but personally this is the best Bond movie I've seen so far with the best James Bond actor yet.",positive
"One of my favorite movies of all time, not just James Bond movies. Great opening scene, great theme song, great cinematography, music, cast and really makes you love being a James Bond fan.",positive
Best Bond theme tune ever. And I love the interaction between Bond and Vesper.,negative
By far the best Bond movie and visually stunning.,positive
"I'm not a huge Bond fan, but this film was simply incredible. One of the best of 2006.",positive
Daniel Craig is an awesome Bond.,positive
"(December 2012) This is what a Bond movie should be. Good action scenes (the one in Africa and the action in Venice were both very good), funny scenes, great ending, and attractive Bond girl.",positive
"good movie, but if james bond ever told me shaken not stirred when i was making his drink.....there would be no james bond anymore",positive
"it doesnt matter if he's blonde, craig has the same physique, personality, and still gets his way with the women just like connery. realistic aproach to the 21st century Bond. Well Done!",positive
One of the best Bond films ever! Daniel Craig portrays one of the best bonds that I have ever seen with his energetic performance. This is the 007 film people have been waiting to see for a long time!,positive
a necessary reboot for the franchise.,positive
best Bond movie since 'You only Live Twice'.,positive
"Pure movie gold. Bond has to face a terrorist named Le Chiffre with his fists, guns, and brains. Bond goes to a Casino Royale special event to face of with Le Chiffre in a game of poker, but that's only one major part in the story. This movie brings James Bond into a newer, darker world with villains trying to get him left and right. Daniel Craig is excellent!",positive
best bond movie ever!!!,positive
"Never have I had the pleasure of watching an action film that covered such a wide range of emotions. Casino Royale is surprisingly well-rounded and thoroughly enjoyable on every level. One of the many things I found so remarkable about this film is that it runs at such a steady, fluid pace. It never loses its audience nor overwhelms them. That is quite an accomplishment for an action/suspense movie. In addition, Daniel Craig portrayed his incarnation of James Bond that was strikingly in depth and surprisingly humanistic. Bravo.",positive
Daniel Craig. WOW. He is definately a strong second best bond of all time. He blows Bronson's garbage out of the world. It shows so well how Bond started of and the transition he had to make from an in your face thug/hitman to super secret agent. I cant wait to see him progress with the character as the movies continue on.,positive
"I wish all Bond films since the beginning were like this. Bond is mean and unkillable. Craig takes on this persona as someone that believes he is supposed to be a 00 agent. Sean Connery and Roger Moore could come across as a bit of a Mr. Magoo. Daniel Craig is able to be a MI6 operative without losing his personality, especially in this movie where it's so essential to the story. The acting from the Bond girl of this film is one of the best ever, and Daniel Craig is definitely the best actor to play Bond, so it's without a surprise that he makes the most entertaining one. The direction is crisp, and Craig is even given his own little introduction to the Bond films before the opening credits. The action sequences are really awesome. Though the movie gets a little slow at the beginning of the second half, it definitely ends smoothly. I really enjoyed it.",positive
"A cold, hard ruthless assassin- the perfect bond. He kills as easily as stepping on a bug. The casino scene was long but really good and fascinating. A great way to see Bond become Bond.",positive
I absolutely loved this Bond reboot. Daniel Craig is so sexy it hurts. And if this film has anything to say about the future of Bond then sign me up!!,positive
"After the sillies and gadgetry of recent bond films and the goofy i-don't-know-the-cast-except-Woody-Allen 1967 version. ""Casino Royale"" is a reinvention and renovation of the 007 franchise, with Craig assumes the role formerly as the new Bond that's more realistic and human, the new and better reinvention of 007. Green's act of Vesper, marked her as one of the best performances of the Bond girls. Dench still acting like a jewel as M, and Mikkelsen are a great villain. It shows a seriousness during the movie, with intense action scenes, typical of the director of Goldeneye, Martin Campbell. ""Casino Royale"" is a smart, stylish and thrilling reboot of the Bond franchise, with an haunted and intense brand new 007.",positive
Outstanding performances by Craig and Eva Green takes Bond to new heights that we haven't seen in a long time. The best bond movie I've seen.,positive
Best Bond from Daniel Craig.,positive
"<i>''The name's Bond. James Bond.'' </i> In his first mission, James Bond must stop Le Chiffre, a banker to the world's terrorist organizations, from winning a high-stakes poker tournament at Casino Royale in Montenegro. <b>Daniel Craig</b>: James Bond <i>''I'm sorry. That last hand... nearly killed me.'' </i> The character of Bond presented in <i>Casino Royale</i> may disappoint followers of the original films, but the news is, this is Fleming's Bond. An orphan, uncertain of his own identity, a disillusioned romantic trying hard to pretend he's incapable of emotions, a middle class, middle-brow, middle-level management type who just happens to kill people for a living. But he does it extremely well. The other problem some general viewers may have is the level of violence in the film; having determined to film the novel realistically, director Martin Campbell has decided to ditch the 'B-movie' violence of most of the earlier films, and present us the violence with a hard British neo-noir spark to it. Given the romantic plot twist toward the end, this would be a perfect date movie also. Except that the violence left some of the female viewers in the Cinema I attended clearly scared. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it just is part of the roller-coaster of the film's antics. <i>''Arrogance and self-awareness seldom go hand in hand.'' </i> Cambell's direction is very good, the writing is crisp and clinical, production values are an all time high; the photography is beyond excellence. Some of the stunt work is truly remarkable and jaw dropping. The acting is rock-solid and believable for these characters. There is plenty of muscle for the action-film fan, and some real brains for the more intellectual viewer to ponder in the ensuing plot contrivances. <i>Casino Royale</i> is best viewed with minimal reliance on knowledge of the previous installments. In fact, it functions perfectly well as a one-off, a film without a series. It's <i>The Bourne</i> of <i>Bond</i> pretty much and it takes ideas from that series and uses them for it's own inspirational means. <i>''Why is it that people who can't take advice always insist on giving it?'' </i> The real ace here is Craig. He doesn't have Connery's raw star quality, but he's easily the best actor to have played the part for ages. I don't know if the film was shot in sequence but for the only time since <i>Majesty's Secret Service</i> you get a sense of Bond evolving throughout the film as his cockiness becomes confidence and his brutality becomes cold icy efficiency. He starts off unlikeable but human and gradually picks up the Bond traits we know and love, until he becomes more likable but just a little less human. It's an interesting journey and Craig is up to the task in hand. It's not just his delivery, it's also his body language and dedication to the mission. Even his fighting style changes as he adapts. <i>''I'm sorry I'm not sorry.'' </i> Physically he's the most in your face Bond since Lazenby and the action scenes look brutal and effective with a gritty realism long forgotten or unseen. Even the not very likely free running chase is spectacular but believable because you get the idea that this really is kill or be killed antics. It's got a real feel of danger to it that hasn't been seen in the series in years. Only the torture scene feels like it's holding back but that's probably fear of the censors. You'll come out of this one not just thinking that Daniel Craig <b>IS</b> James Bond, that no-one has ever played him before. Let's all hope they don't lose their nerve with Bond 22 and bring back the sci-fi crap and unrealistic gadgetry, because this could be a real new habit to emphasis...Roll on <i>Quantum Of Solace</i>! <i>''I have no armour left. You've stripped it from me. Whatever is left of me - whatever is left of me - whatever I am - I'm yours.''</i>",positive
"Casino Royale was a good watch but I still feel that Daniel Craig does not fit Ian Flemming's role of James Bond. James Bond was more of a smooth operator and physically was described more handsome and debonair than Daniel Craig. Daniel Craig is more brutish, far more so, than the Ian Flemming Bond. Also the storyline of Casino Royale is a very loose translation of the novel, but basically captures the overall feel of the book. I think they did well with updating things for technology of the current day. The biggest disappointment in this film for me is that very little of the dialogue from the novel was used which I feel would have made this film even better. Also, the first hour of the movie is a complete fabrication which isn't part of the novel. I liked Eva Green as Vesper, she's a true beauty and Bond girl. While she played the role well I would have prefered the end of her role the way it was in the book over the direction the film took. However, overall I think it was a good watch and for the most part you get the feel of ""Bond"" and the action and style that you'd expect.",negative
Best Bond movie ever! absolutely loved it!,positive
"""Casino Royale"" is a fantastic James Bond film. The action, plot and dialogue are all above-average for a Bond film, and Daniel Craig manages to make 007 a three-dimensional character. Much needed character development is also added. The first hour is nearly perfect, and although the ending feels slightly rushed ""Casino Royale"" ranks up there with the early Sean Connery films as one of the best Bond movies.",positive
iv seen alot of lame movies lately so i went lucking for a sure thing that wouldnt dissapoint (also iv never really watched james bond before) and casino royale did not dissapoint i taught it was pretty class and i shall now go on to watch quantum of solace and skyfall nuff said.,positive
Great action flick. Bond before he was superhuman!,positive
daniel craig is a badass. bond is back!,positive
"What's more thrilling than James Bond playing poker for 2 hours? James Bond stumbling over his own action scenes. Yeah, can't say I liked this very much.",negative
The best bond film yet.,positive
"I can't call this a flawless 007 movie, but I was still engrossed and entertained throughout.",positive
Best Bond in the last few years.,positive
"All other Bond's (except Goldeneye) should be like this as they all suck. This is brilliant, believable spy shit",positive
"This is one of the best Bond movies ever. It didn't just bring the series back to life, it pumped it full of adrenaline and gave it a real heartbeat. My favorite film of 2006.",positive
"Casino Royale nos presenta un reinicio a la franquicia mas vieja de la historia, nos presenta a un James Bond actual y humano en un mundo moderno, en el cual lo veremos comenzar desde que se convierte en un agente 00 y que ira pasando por diversas situaciones que lo formaran en el legendario agente del MI6. Sin duda Daniel Craig viene a refrescar la franquicia con su buena actuacion, al igual que Eva Green quien se convierte al instante en una de las mejores ""Chica Bond"" de la historia del agente. Sin duda uno de los mejores films de esta legendaria franquicia.",positive
"After Die Another Day, this was the perfect route for the James Bond franchise to go. That is, back to James Bond's beginnings as a MI6 00 Agent and his first mission. Based on the first Bond book by Ian Flemming, this is done perfectly and does the franchise great justice after the previous two awful versions of Casino Royale (The 1954 CBS TV special and the 1967 awful spoof which was a waste of the license to make the movie). Daniel Craig is a great James Bond. The movie gave a great background story on how James Bond came to be who he became.",positive
"Casino Royale is an awesome movie, and is the best iteration of 007 featuring Daniel Craig; although, Skyfall is very close. There are so many memorable scenes here, including when Bond gets poisoned in the casino, the torture scene, and the chase in the construction site. Daniel Craig is solid as James Bond and Eva Green is just as good as the Bond girl Vesper Lynd. Mads Mikkelsen is definitely good as the villain Le Chiffre, but of course, does not stand in the same league as Javier Bardem's Silva in Skyfall; but then again, nobody does. The only complaint I could possibly think of would be that the story moves incredibly fast, and it's really easy to miss an important part of the story. This isn't really a flaw, as any confusion can be cleared up through repeated viewings (which is totally worth it). Casino Royale is also extremely entertaining and is never boring. This is in part due to the fact that the film is overall so well-rounded; from the action to the cinematography, everything about this Bond is golden.",positive
one of my all time favorite bond movies,positive
I like it.....perfect amount of action and suspense that a Bond movie deserves....,positive
one of the few remakes that is better than the 1967 version.,positive
"El mejor James Bond de todos. El mas humanos, y logrado. Aunque puede que no sea el James Bond original.",positive
"This is the greatest Bond movie ever made. A film that is dialogue-based, but never lacks action; that is smart and sexy, but not overblown; this is the Bond movie for which we have all been waiting. After the abysmal ""Die Another Day,"" hope has finally been restored. Daniel Craig is James Bond, and there can be no substitute.",positive
Daniel Craig exploded on screen in his first Bond adventure.It was also the longest Bond movie so far. What I liked about Daniel Craig as Bond is that he was ruthless and Hardcore just like the good old Connery days!! Definate must see for Bond Fans.,positive
"Perfect Bond film, and an epic introduction for Daniel Craig instantly proving that he deserves the 007 gig. It contains thrills with massive action sequences, a romance exuding sex and realistic fight scenes. Daniel Craig has the intensity and physique which past Bond leads didn't have making him an exciting and believable lead. It's a sexy addition to the Bond series and possibly the best.",positive
The best bond is years.,positive
"A wonderful new start to a new James Bond series, Casino Royale benefits from Daniel Craig, as well as a new style of writing that takes the James Bond franchise more seriously (Just like the Christopher Nolan Batman movies take the superhero more seriously).",positive
James Bond is classy and intense.,positive
the best Bond yet...,positive
Craig is the best Bond ever!!!!!,positive
only the beginning is cool ~15 min. the rest of the movie sucks hard.,negative
Best Bond film yet! Craig's Bond is a breath of fresh air into the franchise,positive
"Finally a more realistic Bond film. Craig proves to be a great choice, and perhaps the best since Sean Connery.",positive
Its definitively the best Bond movie by far,positive
Best James Bond ever! And the opening track as well: Chris Cornell - You know my name. Remarkable movie.,positive
My new favorite bond.,positive
Quite exciting and well done opening for the new 007,positive
This bond film isn't really a bond film but its still awesome,positive
"Hard to imagine a better re-ignition to the franchise. Bond is more emotional than ever which is great for the fans to see a new side to him. Daniel Craig is probably the best Bond yet, Eva Green is certainly one of the sexiest Bond girls, and this is easily one of the best in the series.",positive
"daniel craig IS james bond, in the Chris Nolan era of gritty realism.. he makes Bond seem like a real life agent not a fictional superhero",positive
"Casino Royale is a bold and rewarding update to the Ian Fleming franchise, replacing theatrics with realism to form a Bond that is both unrestrained and vulnerable.",positive
Gearing up for Skyfall. Daniel Craig is BOND.,positive
"Craig makes the role his own, and will make you think Sean who? Incomparable acting, drama, suspense, and an ending scene for the ages. Not only is this the best Bond film ever, it is the best film of all time.",positive
"Equal best Bond film, equal to Skyfall",positive
Finally a serious and darker James bond movie. Daniel Craig is the best bond in bond's movie history. Casino Royale is the best James Bond movie along with Skyfall.,positive
Good enough...more intelligent than most modern action movies.,negative
didn't understand it,negative
I was never a huge bond fan until now. I've seen a few older films portrayed by different actors. This by far was my favorite. Now I know what made Bond into 007.,positive
i loved this movie!!!!!!!!,positive
"This film kept me glued to the screen from start to finish. From the free-running in the opening sequence to the heartbreaking finale in Venice, the film is beautifully and brilliantly shot, acted and scripted. The Bond franchise has been running for fifty years and although I am a Bond fan, I found some of the films prior to Casino Royale were weak and too saturated with product placement opportunities. I thought Daniel Craig's portrayal of 007 in this film was engaging, intense, witty, refreshing and let's be honest, the man is damn handsome too. Bond is sent to Madagascar to spy on a terrorist, Mollaka. He subsequently investigates Mollaka's terror cell, a task which takes him to various exotic locations beginning with the Bahamas. There he encounters Dimitrios and his girlfriend Solange and comes closer to finding the terrorist finacier Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen). When Bond hears that Le Chiffre will be playing in a high-stakes poker game at Montenegro's Le Casino Royale, M (Judi Dench) sends ""the money"" agent Vesper (Evan Green) to assist Bond in attempting to win the game. I won't spoil the ending for those who few who haven't yet watched the film but suffice to say that the closing scenes in Venice are brief but thrilling and make for a stunning ending to a hugely enjoyable film.",positive
"I am a huge Bond fan, and I truly love each movie for what each one is. That said when I rate Bond movies, I rate them against themselves and not the entire Hollywood movie population. Casino Royal truly breathed new life into Bond. The film is magnificent. The story is energetic (even making a poker game seem like intense action) and the action sequences can't be compared to previous Bond films. Definitely a much more serious take on Bond. It reminds me of what they tried to do with Bond when Timothy Dalton took on the role, but were never able to completely convey. This is a great direction to be taking Bond in and I'm quite excited for his future!",positive
"So fresh and still so old-school, so cool and still so classic, so modern and still so... Bond.",positive
i'm not gonna lie...i'm gay for daniel craig...,positive
"Exceptional Bond film, Craig is great in the role. Intricate plot that clues the viewer into another side of Bond. Definitely revitalisted the franchise.",positive
A great character-driven Bond film.,positive
A really bun 007 film. But it did have some problems. Daniel Craig owns this movie. He steals the show. GRADE:A-,positive
A step in the right direction.,positive
"o 1º Bond com Craig é surpreendente. é quase visceral, com uma dimensão real e uma interpretação poderosa. tou mm fã, quem diria :)",positive
"A really good movie throughout, with lots of action and a good plot. At some parts, however, I couldn't follow and make sense of what was happening. Still, the movie is great.",positive
"Its not trying to be funny or ridiculous, it provides a serious tone over the ""original"" Bond.",positive
One of the best Bond movies I'v seen. I must say the twist was not forgettable.,positive
"In his first mission, James Bond joins an elite poker tournament in order to stop a banker from a terrorist organization from winning. Casino Royal is an exciting Bond movie reboot. It's packed with action that will keep you on the edge of your seat, especially the first half. While there are a few slower parts, mostly mid film, we get to see a softer side of Bond we haven't seen before. There's a good story too so it's not just mindless fight scenes or explosions. Daniel Craig gives a great, cunning performance with his spin on the iconic character of James Bond and is arguably the best to date. The rest of the cast includes the uber-sexy Eva Green as Vesper Lynd, Bond's love interest, Mads Mikkelsen as the villainous Le Chiffre and Judi Dench as M, Bond's boss. With it's awesome action sequences and suspenseful script, Casino Royale is one of the best Bond films to date. Gets A-List Rating of: A-List Approved!

"Simply put, one of the best action films I've ever seen. A Classic from the moment it was committed to celluloid.",positive
"Definetly one of the best entries in the Bond saga, calling this movie a ""Bond movie"" does not do it any justice at all. This is the ""Dark Knight"" of Bond movies, the way I see it. Daniel Craig's Bond seems to steer away from the classy ladiesman and goes for a more brute-ish type character and he does it greatly. Casino Royale is definetly what a reboot should be, offering a much different vibe to it's previous saga and yet still managing to be excellent.",positive
"Apparently, I'm the only person to think this movie is a boring, non-sensical, misogynistic, racist, unnecessarily violent, woodenly-acted mess.",negative
"Casino Royale has a great 1st hour, but then the rest is mostly boring, and it's also 40 minutes too long.",negative
"Daniel Craig invades the world of 007. He's helped along by director Martin Campbell, who knows a thing or two about James Bond. It was Campbell who was responsible for Pierce Brosnan's best turn as 007 in Golden Eye. Here, Craig inhabits the physical demands of the role with panache, but his best moments aren't spent chasing villains or dodging bullets. In fact, Craig's and the movie's best moments occur in the casino. It is there that we see Bond use his intellect, shrewdness, and poker face to outwit the villain. There are no pyrotechnics, special effects, or CGI aspects enhancing or distracting the viewer's experience. Instead, it's a stripped down sequence, which puts everything on Craig and his director to draw out as much drama as possible with the sequence. They pull it off in spades. I just wish the rest of the movie matched its ingenious construction. Overall, Craig and Campbell serve up an entertaining, 007 entry.",positive
"Having just seen Skyfall, I decided to go back and watch Daniel Craig's debut Bond performance again to see how it compares. I think I probably liked Skyfall *slightly* better, but honestly, when you've got two Bond movies that are this strong it seems almost ungrateful to pit them against each other. Instead, just be thankful the franchise has moved beyond implausible nonsense like invisible cars, laser battles in outer space, and Denise Richards trying to pass herself off as a nuclear physicist!",positive
"The Bond series gets rebooted and returns to its roots in Casino Royale. Based on the original Ian Fleming novel, the story follows MI6 secret agent James Bond as he enters into a high stakes poker tournament in order to capture a terrorist agent. Daniel Craig takes up the mantel of James Bond, and gives a tough and gritty portrayal of the character. And, Eva Green delivers a stunning performance that's especially compelling. However, the storytelling is poor; the plot is too cluttered and goes on for far too long. Additionally, some of the action scenes are overly contrived. Still, Casino Royale is an exciting adventure that delivers an edgier new Bond.",negative
"Con ""Casino Royale"" el agente 007 logra lo que nunca pudo con sus primeras 20 películas, ser tomado en serio. Daniel Craig es el Bond más rudo y realista de todos, sin depender de sus encantos ó aparatos de super espía, su personaje logra impresionar a todos, incluso a quienes lo consideraban un mero ""metrosexual"" por años. Sin mencionar que la trama, el humor, y las escenas de acción son tan emocionantes como ingeniosas. Si esta no es la mejor película del 007 es por lo menos una de las mejores.",positive
"Fleming's plot actually requires the film's addition of some heavy action sequences (all done very snappy, with a brutally realistic edge), because the novel is very claustrophobic; the original TV version of the story (1955, with Barry Nelson as 'Jimmy Bond'), only used three indoor sets, because it could - except for the car chase and an attempted bombing at an outdoor cafÃ (C), Fleming's novel took place almost entirely within Bond's hotel suite and the gaming room. The film's opening this novel out to the world is actually quite welcome, and does not affect the central plot or its theme.The character of Bond presented in this film may disappoint followers of the original films, but the news is, this is FLEMING's Bond - an orphan uncertain of his own identity, a disillusioned romantic trying hard to pretend he's incapable of emotions, a middle class, middle-brow, middle-level management type who just happens to kill people for a living. But he does it extremely well.The other problem some general viewers may have is the level of violence in the film; having determined to film the novel realistically, director Martin Campbell has decided to ditch the 'B-movie' violence of most of the earlier films, and present us the violence with a hard 'British neo-noir' edge to it. Given the romantic plot twist toward the end, this would be a perfect date movie - except that the violence left some of the female viewers in the theater I attended clearly unsettled. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it just is part of the gestalt of the film's experience.Cambell's direction is very good; the writing is crisp; production values are very high; the photography is stunning. Some of the stunt work is truly remarkable, worthy competition for Jackie Chan. The acting is rock-solid and believable for these characters. There is plenty of muscle for the action-film fan, and some real brains for the more general viewer to ponder later. This film is best viewed with minimal reliance on knowledge of the previous series. In fact, it functions perfectly well as a 'one-off', a film without a seriesBut of course, the ending invites a sequel. In Godzilla terms, Connery and Moore having given us the 'showa' Bond, Dalton and Brosnan the ""Heisei"" Bond, we now have the ""Millenium"" series James Bond - not a prequel nor even a 'reboot', but, really, an entirely new series about the same character. It is probably too much to hope for, but maybe they can make the sequels just as good as this.",positive
"A very good debut for Daniel Craig, following in Bronson's footsteps.",negative
"One of the best Bond films ever. Craig's version of 007 is more down to earth and realistic that some of the others (yes, even Sean Connery), and I really like him. He is my favorite Bond to date. The plot changed significantly from the book, but the changes were necessary. For a movie about a game of poker, spending two hours watching this is no gamble: it's an entirely enjoyable and entertaining experience, both for the diehard fans and the newcomers to the series.",positive
Absolute Masterpiece.,positive
This is the best Bond film ever.,positive
"By far, the best Bond movie of the series, Daniel Craig, reinvents a tired and formulaic film series and is easily the most charismatic and genuine interpretation of Bond. The movie is devoid of those ridiculous, excruciating one liners and Craig manages to create a relatable and distinguishable character with apparent ease. James is back and with a bang, yes pun intended.",positive
"One of cinema's most favorite iconic series is obviously in dubious hands when the protagonist is subjected to using the natural logic of riding a sixty-foot wave to infiltrate a North Korean military base. Yes, that was the introduction to Pierce Bronson's final vehicle ""Die Another Day,"" and along with the invisible car (seriously?), his final outing obviously accelerated the self-parody and sardonic elements within the Bond universe to a ridiculous extent. Similar to Schumacher's antics with ""Batman and Robin,"" Bronson's final film left the pop-culture icon within a facetious state. Despite its success at the Box-Office, MGM obviously wanted an authentic entry that would subject one of cinema's most beloved character to respectable proportions, and it's no understatement that ""Casino Royale"" is most definitely Bond's defibrillator. Director Martin Campbell's choice of creating the film as a prequel to Bond's beginnings evidently provides flexibility within handling the Idiosyncratic character with refreshing characteristics. A new bond that ditches the nostalgia elements of ridiculous gadgets and sex-obsessed characteristics, which in return provides a window to genuine emotion. Oppose to watching a ritual affair of generic and artificial characteristics, Campbell is willing to explore the essential components of what makes Bond, James Bond. As stated, ""Casino Royale"" introduces us to Bond before his 007 status. After brutally and successfully stopping a terrorist attack, Bond first mission consist of stopping an international terrorist banker Le Chiffre (Mikkelson) through a high-stake poker game located at Casino Royale. It's most definitely not an understatement to claim that many, many Bond films are either bloated or convoluted. The majority of entries are all formula; continuously attempting to cramp in too many essential characteristics: whether it be the ridiculous gadgets, beautiful woman or cringe-worthy dialogue, most entries fail to focus on a central story. Thankfully, Royale identifies this and simply focuses on the basics; it strips away the ridiculous and superfluous concepts that gives its narrative room to breath - thanks to the beautiful pacing of the screenplay. Furthermore, Royale really only consist of four essential action sequences - each one as breathtaking as the next. However, one of the most refreshing aspects within ""Casino Royale"" is that action seems to arrive organically rather than seeming forced (looking at you Quantum of Solace). Additionally, with a lesser focus on the action aspect, Campbell allows himself to tell a realistic, emotional and engaging story. And while some of the plot elements seem adventitious, it never stretches to the point of being ridiculed; in fact, this along side ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love"" could well be the epitome of a Bond that is grounded through a sense of reality. Without an overload on action; ""Casino Royale"" actually has time to explore the emotional predicaments of its central character rather than walking away from a generic affair that only reuses its ritual characteristics (Well I guess it's difficult to create a continues character after twenty-two entries). This is quite possibly why Craig's first outing succeeds over other Bond films; Campbell is willing to explore Bond internally rather than keeping it external. As always, Bond consist of a egotistical nature, simply doing what he wants and not giving a damn. However, a noticeable change within Royale universe is its handling of women; rather than being sexual objects -well to be fair there is one (only one!?)- and passive entertainments for Bond use, the woman contain a central focus to Bond's internal decisions. To begin with, there is obviously M played by the brilliant Judi Dench. An immensely welcomed relationship that is continually being developed over the course of Craig's outings (apparently this is resonant for ""Skyfall""). M is very much Bond's auspice, a woman that ultimately keeps him grounded within his egotistical nature and the only woman that Bond seems to trust. Her actions resemble Alfred purposes within Nolan's Batman. However, the inclusion of Vesper (Green) is the most rewarding aspect within the woman department. Craig and Green's first sequence shared together obviously displays natural chemistry. On initial appearance, their relationship seems typical 007 formula: Vesper initial fights the urge of Bond's charms, but eventually gives into his irresistible nature. Ok, to be truly fair, their relations do play-out similar to the generic formula, but Bond - for the only second time since ""On her majesty secret service""- actually shares genuine love for Vesper rather than being characterized as another sexual instrument. She stripes his pretentious, ignorant, and egotistical armor to provide an actual glimpse into Bond's emotional core; for the first time we learn why Bond is the way he is, why he functions and why he simply does not trust women. Being an idiosyncratic character, there was obviously a up-roar from loyal Bond fans from the casting of Daniel Craig as the next bond - mainly due to his unorthodox appearance (Blond hair anyone?). However, Craig's performance defines expectations and he is most certainly the best Bond since Sean Connery. The reason for this is that Craig's interpretation of Bond is realistically grounded. Furthermore, Craig creates a great balance between the icons essential characteristics: Physical brutality and irresistible charm. Where others failed - Roger Moore conveyed the charm but lacked execution of the physical aspect, very similar to Pierce Bronson's efforts - Craig is brilliant at emerging these two components, especially his physical presence. Despite consisting of many death-defying stunts, Craig contains realism in his movements to point that the action ultimately feels real - just watch the opening 'Parkour' sequence. Every Film-Buff has that certain cinematic catalyst - whether it be a series or an individual effort - that began their love for film. To be honest, my was James Bond. I remember my first viewing of ""Dr. No"" and simply being mesmerized from the coolest action-hero I have ever seen. However, it is quite annoying when you watch one of your favorite characters get dragged through the dirt. Their have been many great entries into the Bond canon, but the negative entries most definitely outweigh the positives. Thankfully, ""Casino Royale"" is a mature image of Bond that ultimately restores faith within the iconic character.",positive
Awesome bond film! Daniel Craig fits the role of bond perfectly for this generation.,positive
"The first installment in the 007 reboot of the franchise brings a fresh start in which the agent acts more as a human being not depending on fantastic gadgets and unbelievable stunts, you can enjoy a smart and interesting film.",positive
Un bon Bond. J'aime particulierement les scenes au casino.,negative
"""Casino Royale"" moves at an exceptionally great pace and is a wonderful and gritty reintroduction to James Bond. Most definitely the most intense movie about a card game. Intelligent and action packed, go see it, it's worth every second. My favorite from the Bond franchise due to unique and surprisingly dark tone and a thrilling ride from start to finish. Daniel Craig proves that he belongs in this universe and his Bond is still one of my favorite portrayals to date. Eight years later, there still hasn't been a movie in the franchise that tops this one.",positive
Didn't quite do it for me. In fact it got quite boring in the middle and the payoff feels half done.,negative
"Solid action, great acting, and a cool, modern take on possibly the greatest action hero of all time!",positive
"Awesome! It's a long film but its worth the watch. The action, drama, twists and turns sucks you in making you want more. I'm starting to see why they chose Craig to be the new Bond...James Bond.",negative
"Did not get it for the first time I see it, though after a few time, I know what is the fuss is about this film, the point about this film is not about the action, and certainly not about the silly action, it's pretty much about the journey of Bond, and what is the thing that make him, and for the first time, James Bond actually gets hurt, and that's something really special, overall, I say this is the second best James Bond movie and Daniel Craig is the best Bond yet.",positive
"Very smart, very well defined and very unpredictable throughout the whole movie. It had a really intense plot, and the action scenes were well timed and tough. The problem about this film is that, the romantic parts are too long and uninteresting. I can only say that it was a great reboot and Daniel Craig interprets a great James Bond.",positive
"Craig is extraordinary, and Casino Royale kicks ass.",positive
Best Bond since Connery.,positive
Craig and Green are excellent and the production is sharp as can be..,positive
"A smart reinvention of the acclaimed franchise, Casino Royale delivers action on a shaken, not stirred, level and Daniel Craig delivers a young and daring portrayal as our favorite secret agent.",positive
"A great Bond movie with lots of action. The beginning was crazy just like they all are and even the opening credits always makes the movie great. The acting from everyone didn't feel cheap or anything I thought it was fantastic, quite surprised Craig wasn't nominated for Best Actor in this one. He's a great Bond and really fits the role well. I loved how crazy this movie got with the action almost every 20 minutes and the torture scene just keeps you on the edge of your seat. There is one scene during the long Casino game when they used such amazing shots and really makes your heart jump on how well they did it. I really enjoyed this movie, it didn't have one dull moment, glad I finally got to see it.",positive
"My favorite Bond film so far. Before Daniel Craig, I seriously never thought anybody could top Sean Connery as Bond. I've had to change my thinking..",positive
"Bond has become a more flawed character who can fail - which is a refreshing change. This movie also has great performances, sharp dialogue and it sustains the intrigue even when the action stops.",positive
"My personal favorite Bond film. Great set-pieces, drama, and surprising emotional resonance. Bond films have always been action-packed, exciting, and sexy; but this one really has an immense dramatic impact. Not only does it have all those elements that make a Bond film what it is, it is also a character study of a vulnerable and very flawed character, culminating in one of the saddest films I have seen in the past decade. Daniel Craig is tied for my favorite Bond alongside Connery.",positive
"Having not seen any other Bond movie in its entirety, I can't rate this in the context of the franchise; but it is certainly a top-notch spy thriller.",positive
three words BEST BOND EVER,positive
A giant rope knot thwapping Bond's undercarriage? Priceless.,positive
Its an OK movie just not a good Bond film. Just like Daniel Craig is a good actor but a terrible James Bond.,negative
"Pretty good new age James Bond movie, nice action sequences though there could've been more. Only thing i didn't like was the whole poker thing, it was classy but a little stupid.",positive
"Classy reintroduction to James Bond, ala Daniel Craig style where he strips the shit out of everybody and plays a mean game of poker on the side.. Not content with being alpha hes also elequent, charming and vicious on the side. A true MacDaddy",negative
Very good action movie. Acting is great and script is solid. Into the movie the entire time!,negative
Outstanding Bond Film! Real Good Action and Romance!,positive
"Double ""Oh, myyyyyyyyyy...""",positive
"Not since the Sean Connery era, has Bond been so vigorous. Daniel Craig is fantastic as 007.",positive
The best part of this movie was Eva Green except then she died.,negative
"great movie, I just watched all his Bond movies so I could see the last one more fresh.",positive
It's an astonishing new Bond. He couldn't have left any one alive.,positive
"Best overall bond movie in my opinion, from the story to the acting and action scenes its simply amazing.",positive
"Si parte dalla scena iniziale con il parkour e la lotta sulla gru, e gia' li si parte bene. Il film poi e' molto piu' cupo (come molti film degli anni 2000), ma secondo me non e' quello che premia il film, in primis c'e' una regia che si fa sentire ed e' di qualita'. Craig nei panni di Bond non mi ha mai convinto e continua a non convincermi, troppo muscoloso e freddo. Il personaggio di 007 invece e' piu' interessante, piu' vero, piu' ""sporco"". Questo film ha tirato su' una serie che stava andando spegnendosi, gli ultimi film parevano un qualsiasi film action degli anni '90. Forse un po' troppo lungo e secondo me perde l'autoironia, pero' torna ai fasti dei migliori Bond.",positive
"A true classic. Martin Campbell, a decade plus after doing a very good job on a soft reboot of Bond (Goldeneye) returns to the franchise for a true hard reboot. Daniel Craig fills the role brilliantly. Judi Dench, in her 5th outing as M, is finally given a role to sink her teeth into (outside that one brilliant speech, also back in Goldeneye) something worthy of her talents. And Eva Greene, as Vesper Lynd, is quite possibly my favorite of all the Bond girls. An excellent performance by quite possibly the most beautiful woman working in Hollywood today.",positive
Badass action movie my favorite James Bond is easily Daniel Craig.,positive
Craig not Bond. This movie is too long and doesn't even feel like a Bond movie.,negative
"An intense, classy, and full force 007 movie.",positive
A case of fixing what ain't broke that actually fixes what wasn't broke. Inspired and brilliant. Daniel Craig is a revelation.,positive
"Perfectly captures a rugged James Bond. He's arrogant and self awareness. Not solely a psychological agent, he'll get in there and dish out some hits. And he kicks ass in a finally tailored tux. Eva Green is a gorgeous and a perfect female counterpart to Bond.",positive
"Now, before I begin this review, let me stress that I am not a huge James Bond fan and probably wouldn't be, even if I gave the older films a chance. With that said, I adore Casino Royale! This film is smart, exciting, and well acted. Daniel Craig delivers a Bond that I'd never thought could exist, with a ruggedly charming look and a tough attitude that keeps him interesting and dangerous, at the same time. Does the film have some flaws? Probably. But, all those are overlooked by the fact that this film drives you through a plot where you're cheering on the hero all the way and being pleasantly surprised by the situations that go down, throughout. As I've said, I'm not a huge Bond fan, but I can spot a great movie when I see it and Casino Royale takes the cake. It'll be hard to envision anyone other than Craig, as this iconic character. I'd recommend it to just about anyone.",positive
"Finally ridding bond of the cheesy, bizarre espionage that dominated the Brosnan era, Daniel Craig revitalised Bond, back to his very best.",positive
"Casino Royale is a fresh perspective of the 007 series, by turning the iconic character into a serious human being (thanks to an outstanding portrayal by Mr. Craig) in this nicely crisp reboot of the newly welcomed Bond series.",positive
"A solid action thriller, nothing more, i thought.",negative
"A 2-dimensional Bond runs, runs, plays poker and then runs some more... A lot's of clichés and some inconsistency ruin an otherwise aestethically beautiful movie!",negative
"The best Bond movie of the 21st Century!!!!!! After too much abuse of Q gadgetry and silly and sometimes creepy senseless villains, that what they only care is to conquer the world on impossible ways, it was necessary to dispose everything we have seen of our hero recently and bring a new image but at the same time a real opposition, a threat that matters to everybody and is the real thing of moment..... How about terrorism!!!!!! Well, it seems after 9/11, nothing is going to be the same..... And talking about that nothing is going to be the same for this franchise, well is your doubting, well take a good look at it..... No more Q, no more gadgets, no more Moneypenny, and more important no more brunette Bond, yes..... We are talking about Daniel Craig. Craig, being the 6th incarnation of the international English spy, it is what we have been expecting all the time. Not only he is the man to do the job, but he is cold, arrogant, cocky and sometimes, too confident on what he does. This not the Bond that lays any woman on his bed and then goes for the mission or the Bond who smile while kicking ass, no, this is different...... Comparing with his predecessor, Daniel Craig is not only taking the job as Connery do for the first time in Dr. No, but he is credible on what he does. There is not foolish on himself or tip that he is not the right choice to be the new Bond of this century, no, he is what we the fans have being expecting since Brosnan left the series 10 years ago. Follow by the awesome and unforgettable dame Judi Dench as M, in her 5th Bond movie, Casino Royale, is the real deal we have being expecting since Connery left the series..... Based on the first novel Mr. Fleming wrote, CR adaptation follows close in of what happen in the novel, except with one thing..... Terrorism enters the void as the main plot point in the story, which works perfectly!!!!! Campbell (Goldeneye) makes a great comeback in this reboot, by not only disposing action every moment for more a thrilling and suspense, that was suppose to be in a Bond film. Examples of that you can see it when Bond is given his first mission for a 00 licence to kill promotion or the bombing of a plane in Miami International airport. Those moments including the game dueling card table and the final moments of the films, makes CR the best in the series and probably the only one to have a close approximation of what Ian Fleming novels should be. Highly recommendable for those who are fans of Connery's Bond and more important, those who want see a close adaptation of CR in the big screen!!!!!!",positive
Great movie. Daniel Craig is possibly the best Bond yet!,positive
"Double spies, fast cars, intense action, scotch whisky, beautiful women, Texas hold'em poker and dirty money. Doesn't get any better than this.",positive
"It's great action-wise, but it suckers you in to make you watch the most depressing romances I have ever seen in a bond film. So it's good, but I don't think I could make myself watch it more than once.",positive
"I remember when it was announced that Daniel Craig was taking on the role as James Bond a lot of people were nervous and/or upset. ""A Blond James Bond?"" ""He doesn't look the part!"" ""Worst. Choice. Ever."" I saw those three sayings a lot in the lead up to ""Casino Royale"". I'm proud to say I thought Craig was a good choice, and was more hopeful than anything. Then, I went to see the movie with my Dad, and knew that this movie was special. This is my favorite Bond movie(although ""Skyfall"" is very close now""). Daniel Craig is the perfect Bond, and in my opinion the Best Bond(sorry Connery supporters). He makes the role very realistic and has a real badass persona, mixed with charisma that most actors don't pull off at all. ""Casino Royale"" is kind of like the James Bond version of ""Batman Begins"". It's a reboot of the series, and sets it off in a very grounded way. This movie has everything a Bond movie should have. Hot women, crazy action, a weird villain, and one of the best on screen poker games ever. I love this movie and left the theater in absolute joy at where the franchise was heading. I rewatched this the other night(had to skip some Bond movies to watch the Craig movies before ""Skyfall"".) and it holds up very well, and I'm sure 20 years from now this will still be at the top(or very close to) of the list of Bond movies. If you haven't seen this, then jump on board and check it out. It's an absolute must watch!",positive
Most excellent reboot of the 007 series.,positive

the most destructive Bond ever. He breaks everything he touches. I like the fact that its a 007 learning what it means to be James Bond,negative
"Nearly gadget free, this installment was more about getting to know Bond than anything. More of the action you enjoy watching, fewer of the quirks that have always annoyed you in the past.",positive
"A more realistic and, to be honest, better Bond movie without quite as many of the laughs, but a lot of action and suspense.",positive
"Stunning brtual rebirth for Bond in the most unlike of Bond films, but fortunately it is a near masterpiece. Makes you realise how much we've probably all overrated Skyfall (as enjoyable as it is). Casino Royale is captivating from start to finish.",positive
My husband liked it alot but it did streach on forever and ever.,positive
"Casino Royale is a full-packed action film, a rebirth of the Bond series and to date the greatest Bond film ever created. Daniel Craig, has blew minds away after a long disappointing lousy series with Brosnan. Craig could probably be the best Bond ever, only surpassed by Sean Connery. The film itself consist of twists, never expected; mixed with an undeniable romance chemistry between Craig and Eva Green: who is as a matter of fact beautiful. Casino Royale is a different type of action film. The thrills and mysteries will leave it lingering in minds but most importantly hearts. The film also has a strong villain, with Mikkelsen; which I have to say is amazing. In summary, Casino Royale is appealing, smart, creative, and entertaining. This is the greatest action film of the year. Actually, it is the greatest film of the year; and possibly the decade.",positive
"Great reboot for James Bond. Daniel Craig may look too old for this, but he has the guts and charisma.",positive
"Casino Royale, James Bond film which stars Daniel Craig and his first entry as famous fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Film was directed by Martin Campbell and written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Paul Haggis. Essential film to come out and very delicately touched to adhere marvelous action-sequences filled with blasting entertainment. It banged the people in this part of the world, when it was released in 2006. NOTE: Never wrote the movie review before, thanks to Cesar who reminded me of this film.",positive
"Overall Grade: A+ Daniel Craig is Bond, James Bond. With great amounts of style and strength, and without seeming invulnerable, Craig creates a real-life Bond. ""Casino Royale"" is filled with implausible action sequences that I ended up believing are possible, because Craig believed they were possible. This is a well grounded, but not completely realistic, well crafted thrill ride. A nearly perfect, masterfully executed movie.",positive
"This movie is where the heart of the Bond franchise is. Casino Royale has set the bar that is almost impossible to reach. Also, Daniel Craig has proven himself to be one of the best, if not the best Bond yet.",positive
The greatest bond film ever,positive
"What's more thrilling than James Bond playing poker for 2 hours? James Bond stumbling over his own action scenes. Yeah, can't say I liked this very much.",negative
"Very action packed and enjoyable at some scenes I wasn't convinced the movie was ""amazing"" I was highly impressed with the ending!",negative

Best James Bond film!,positive
Casino Royale is too entertaining to go unappreciated and Daniel Craig is without a doubt the perfect fit for a new age Bond.,positive
one of the best bond,positive
"Why do people love this one so much? Is it just because it's dark and brooding? I don't feel like this is a James Bond film, it feels too much like something else, like Bourne or other spy films at the time. No Moneypenny, no Q, little of M, a Bond actor that doesn't act, no fun-it's a plot that makes little sense and a bunch of action scenes and one really uncomfortable torture scene. It went too far in the dark direction in my opinion and it was a long time before I felt we could still get real Bond films. Thanks Skyfall!",negative
"While Skyfall has its moments, this is by far the best Bond movie. This is a perfect three piece movie, it's as if you are watching three great films at once. Each major action sequence can easily be the finale of another action movie. Bond is awesome, the villain is awesome, the bond girl is awesome, the movie is awesome.",positive

"The James Bond series always had trouble staying relevant, and pushed the boundaries in both a gritty plot with Dalton entries and plausibility in general. Casino Royale is one of the most important entry in the long running James Bond series for it came in a time when the world was wondering if the series had run it course. Despite huge criticism for a blonde bond and some formulaic storytelling, Casino Royale proved that the series heydays were not behind it. Casino Royale follows James Bond on his first mission as he must stop Le Chiffre, a banker to the world's terrorist organizations, from winning a high-stakes poker tournament at Casino Royale in Montenegro. This entry in the Bond film series is a true depiction of the character from it novel counterpart. In the novels, James Bond is a ruthless, slightly amoral man who does whatever he needs to do to get the job done which is well represented here. Bond does not use any gadgets here and should please readers who have grown tire of the gadget dependent Bond. The plot here is a well crafted spy thriller, but underneath it lies a love story with heart. It explores Bond both emotionally and spiritually as it represent the effect of his lifestyle has on him. While this film is not realistic by any standards, it is more plausible than most iterations. The plot finds way to drive its story moving forward whether it's introducing a new piece of the puzzle for Bond to solve or having Bond face come close to death more than once. The formula here does do away with gadgets, but retains the other elements we are use to seeing which does make it predictable. One problem with the film is main villain Le Chiffre is not that memorable nor that intelligent in retrieving the money he loss. Le Chiffre after all did almost make Bond run over the only person who knew the Swiss bank account to get his money back. Aside from a forgettable villain, Casino Royale is what would you expect a good Bond film to be delivering thrills and a great viewing experience. Daniel Craig is an excellent actor to portray the iconic British spy. Craig simply owns the role retaining the character traits while adding more believability in his more emotional scenes, and still make you believe he is a cold blooded killer. Eva Green is by far the best Bond girl the series has ever had. Eva not only has the looks, but the talent to hold her own and the intelligence a rare trait for the typical Bond girls. Isaach De Bankol gives an excellent performance in his role despite his character not being memorable in any way. The rest of the cast is top as well and director Martin Campbell direction helped give the series new energy. The action sequences are both filmed and breathtaking to witness. Martin Campbell does not shy away from showing Bond vicious nature showing us each brutal kill. The direction works greatly in also making the story as interesting as the action itself. Casino Royale brought new energy in the long running series and presented a Bond true to it novel counterparts. Craig retains the characteristics in his portrayal and adding more depth to it than previous actors ever did. Casino Royale is as close to perfection as a James Bond film can be providing exhilaration for those who are familiar with the series and the average movie goer alike.",positive
THE WORST BOND MOVIE EVER MADE,negative
"Just bought this title in BluRay, possibly one of the greatest bond films ever created. Daniel Craig is the perfect Bond; his mixture of classiness and ruthlessness makes him the supreme character for a film. With the excitement and twists and turns that are abundant throughout the film, this Bond won't disappoint.",positive
"for 2006: finally! this is the James Bond that everyone wanted in the 1st place Daniel Craig steps into the ring in this reboot chronicling Bond getting his 00 status, and portraying himself as he should be: a womanizing, cold-blooded killer that doesn't give a crap, his ego overtakes everything and everyone around him even working for MI6 he has yet to prove himself to be a worthy British spy thank God that this movie reinvigorates the franchise by getting rid of the gadgets, the stupid scenarios, the clunky one-liners, and the absurdity that overshadowed many of the previous James Bond films the filmmakers go to new lengths by giving Bond some humanity this time around everything works: the direction, the acting, the scenery, the action and the characters Vesper Lynd played by Eva Green makes way for the future generation of Bond girls digging into 007's heart Judi Dench still rocks as M, LeChiffre is a good bad guy despite the fact that someone else is pulling all the strings in the background other that some minor flaws, 'Casino Royale' amazingly brings back James Bond in a whole new fashion with a much darker, mature and more serious attitude for fans and newcomers alike Im very glad that they started over from scratch :)",positive
"For a long time, I heard a great deal about Mr. Bond and his various portrayals and missions over the past fifty years. It's shocking enough to say that this was the first '007' feature I've watched in full, and sadly I cannot go on about how Daniel Craig is the best Bond, and why this is probably the best film in the franchise so far. I can say that the film by itself was an incredible experience, and will not soon be forgotten. Hats off to Craig for a brilliant performance (not to mention rocking that tux), and much praise for the heart-racing action sequences, which were some of the best I've seen. As the 'Batman Begins' of the franchise, 'Casino Royale' is a marvelously intense piece of the action genre, and one of the best films from 2006. Bring on 'Quantum of Solace' and 'Skyfall'.",positive
one of the best. Emil K- FUCK YOU and fuck you too Justin L,positive
"A thankfully revived 007; Casino Royale invents a new vision of 007's character, bringing one of the best Bond films we've ever seen.",positive
"Casino Royale is a fun, exciting and action packed thrill ride from start to finish with a captavting performance by Daniel Craig as the Legendary James Bond which could be the best protrayl of the chracater since Sean Conneray. Overall Casino Royale has the elements of a great orignal bond movie with plenty of action and an amzing story along with brillant performoances from the cast espically Daniel Craig, this bond has what it takes to be one the best bond films of the franchise.",positive
"I like this movie more than any other Bond films, Dan was just brilliant as 007... Aston Martin, martini, cool gadgets and beautiful Bond girls are back with a bang... Eva Green also deserves an applaud for her role as Vesper Lynd.",positive
"Royale 007 is about perfect and the best Bond i ever seen. Wonderful James, ass kickers villain and hot Bond girls",positive
martin cambell always seems to start every new bond with a bang. he kicked started pierce brosnan with golden and eye. and made daniel craig the best bond of them all. finally a bond character with an origin story. and not some sex obsessed ego maniac. bond finally has some real emotions and not some stupid gadgets.,positive
"As we're nearing the release of 'Skyfall', I feel it's appropriate to finally review the best Bond film in my opinion: 'Casino Royale'. James Bond is finally given the proper treatment when Daniel Craig takes on the role of the classic agent and shows his true self behind the cool, suave, and deadly exterior. Following his first mission as a double-0, Bond becomes more vulnerable physically and emotionally as he tries to stop global terrorist funding by competing in a poker match against the evil Le Chiffre. The way 'Casino Royale' is constructed is every action junkie's wet dream, because it constantly throws bare knuckle badassery at the screen so viewers never get bored. But better than that, you get a deeper Bond in Craig than Connery, Brosnan, or Dalton ever gave us; proving that Bond is more than just an indestructible being, but damaged in the aftermath of danger and frazzled when love becomes another betrayal. For director Martin Campbell, Bond is his bread and butter. But given any other kind of source material, and the picture drowns in a sea of tacky special fx and laughable dialogue. In 'Casino Royale' though, he has shown us the real deal James Bond and set the standard for future Bond films to come.",positive
"I have never see a Bond so serious and so rude, this movie gives what everybody was expecting, I think this movie erases the bad taste that Pierce Brosnan gave us with his movies.",positive
One of the best Bond films ever made. That's coming from someone who owns and has watched all 21 MGM Bond films numerous times.,positive
"I'm not a Bond aficionado--I've never seen any of the other films. So I can't compare this to other films, but as action flicks go, I thought this was too unrealistic to feel compelling.",negative

"Hard hitting action, gritty realism, excellent writing and slick, suave characters make ""Casino Royale"" an expertly crafted thrill ride packed with brains and brawn.",positive
"Pretty much everything I could have wanted in a spy movie. I was interested in the plot all the way through, the action is perfectly filmed, and I've felt more tension during the gambling scenes in the casino more than most spy movies out there.",positive
Amazing but a few ugly bitches who are whores.,positive
I love me some Daniel Craig.,positive
Great shoot'em up action as in every Bond film.,negative
This is bond. James Bond.,positive
"The franchise revises the style of the upcoming movies and does a daring thing by putting Daniel Craig behind the Walther PPK. Thankfully, the movies adds a thick layer of emotion which is topped off with Daniel's incredible performance. The film takes its time and places Bond into a more gritty, realistic and plot driven world.",positive
"This is finally a Bond Film again that's worth to be called a Bond Film, The movie was very good, nice action, plot, acting; Everything fell in place quite nicely. Obviously nothing shocking compared to other movies, but compare to the previous Bond films, this was diffrent. There was rarely any blood or disturbing scenes, Yes, Sean Connery remains the definitive James Bond, but Daniel Craig effortlessly (actually, it looks like it took a great DEAL of effort) supplants George Lazenby as the very *very* good second best, and hopefully a great Bond for the next decade or more. The charm and stylishness of ""Casino Royale"" cannot be denied, and neither can Craig's impact as 007. The film reminds action fans that, while there are many imitators, James Bond is still at the head of the pack. Overall: Perfect Bond Film.",positive
"A gritty, intense and ruthless Bond is what we get in this excellent instalment in the franchise, featuring the greatest Bond chase/opening scene to date and a fast-paced plot that is always keeping you on your toes.",positive

Best Bond to date (11/4/12).,positive
Una muy buena forma de empezar de nuevo la saga de james bond,positive
"I finally got around to seeing this 'reboot' of the James Bond franchise. I was thoroughly impressed overall. I was skeptical about Daniel Craig playing the iconic British spy,but he really pulled it off. He portrayed Bond as somewhat of a rookie, trying to find his niche and having a sense of trust with people who are working with him whereas his predecessor Pierce Brosnan had a cold calculated style and not letting his supporting cast interfere with his objectives. Great cinematography and a great supporting cast. Some people thought the poker scenes were too long, but I disagree. It really built the tension between Bond and the antagonist with both of them trying to figure each other out. And of course there were plenty of mouthwatering action scenes to keep you on the edge of your seat. I would have to say Casino Royale ranks up there among the best James Bond films in the series. Now I just need to find some time to watch Quantum of Solace before Skyfall comes out this Friday!",positive
Daniel Craig is awesome.,positive
"Casino Royale is a very serious, dark Bond film. One of the best action films ever made, featuring some of the best stunts ever put on film. Daniel Craig is the best actor to play James Bond. Great work from Eva Green and the rest of the cast as well. Martin Campbell made Goldeneye and a fun remake called The Mask of Zorro. Campbell makes some pretty good films. Well, he did make some bad films such as The Legend of Zorro and Green Lantern. However, Casino Royale is one of the best 007 movies ever made.",positive
I haven't seen that many bond movies so I don't have much to base it on but I thought it was pretty cool,negative
"A pretty good movie, but i would prefer a less macho man to keep the legacy on...",negative
"A great Bond movie and an even better action-thriller, Casino Royale is also Daniel Craig's debut as a stoic but troubled 007, and his performance is incredible to say the least. He is obviously more than talented enough to carry on the legacy of past Bond greats like Sean Connery and Roger Moore. Mads Mikkelson also makes a great villain, looking like a typically menacing villain with a glass eye and facial scars. The movie is thrilling from the monochromatic opening to the final action-packed moment, and you'd really be missing out by not watching this if you haven't already. Plus it's great prep for Skyfall, which as of now is released in a week!",positive
"Saw this in anticipation for Skyfall. Alot better than the previous James Bond films. It's a more realistic take on 007, little CGI, no submarine cars, no camouflage cars, no laser beams from sattelites or any of that crap! Daniel Craig does a great job. Great job casting, no weak acting at all. The action was fantastic!",positive
"Awesome movie. Great plot, great special effects, and great acting. An overall great movie. It is hard to sum up and come up with a list of good things for the Bond films because you would be going on for a while.",positive
"Grade: A+ This is probably my favourite Bond film; Daniel Craig is excellent as Bond, the best Bond in my opinion. Bond is nothing like we've seen before and a huge step up from the very wooden Pierce Brosnan. Bond is sexier and rougher than ever and has a huge chip on his shoulder. Craig is also adds more wit and charm to Bond than ever before. I think the film had some brilliant action sequences, Bond makes jumping from building sites look like an ordinary gym workout. The action really keeps you on the edge of your seat. There's just constant adrenaline; gosh does that man ever get to sit down and rest for five minutes? I also thought that the settings were visually stunning; exotic beaches and beautiful cities really make great settings for Bond films. The chemistry between Bond and Bond girl Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green) is great and I liked their love/hate banter. I think this is the first Bond film that ever shows us Bond's softer, more vulnerable and romantic side and I really liked that aspect about the film. It shows that Bond isnt just a careless and cold womaniser. There were some touching moments, which is rare for a Bond film; I thought the scene where Bond comforts Vesper in the shower is really touching. This is a fantastic Bond movie; definitely a big step up from a lot of the Bond films. This film also had some great twists to (I wont give it away). What a brilliant Bond film; I enjoyed every minute.",positive

"Casino Royale has reinvented the character of James Bond, going back to basics in this series reboot. Daniel Craig suits the role perfectly, presenting the character is a more rough-edged and gritty manner, whilst retaining the wit, contrasting a lot with previous incarnations. The dialogue is no longer laughable and clichéd like some of the previous films and instead we have a realistic and visually appealing up-to-date action thriller. The screenplay, Campbell's direction and Daniel Craig's Bond all combine together to create one of the best bond films of the franchise.",positive

"A great reboot to the James Bond 007 series. Daniel Craig owns the told as the new 007. It's a high action suspenseful Bond film. This is Bond's first mission as 00 Agent. Bond comes off as arrogant but has a human side. Also, the theme song of a 007 film is a trademark and ""You Know My Name"" is a great song. Last thought: SO glad Judi Dench reprises her role as M.",positive
"The oldies may be classics, but this reinvention makes Bond more vulnerable and human, which makes him shine all the more.",positive
"Now THIS is an action film. Nonstop two-and-a-half hours of batshit crazy awesomeness, and Mads Mikkelsen makes for a wonderful villain.",positive
"I've always liked this franchise; for me James Bond is one of the greatest characters in the cinema history. I've watched almost every movie of James Bond; until Daniel Craig appear as James Bond my favorites were the ones with Pierce Brosnan, but let me tell you Daniel is even better and that's to say a lot because Pierce Brosnan was great. Casino Royale is maybe the best 007 movie that I've seen so far; it's almost perfect; the story is really great, the characters are great and in this movie we could see a very different James Bond, you could say more vulnerable and human. I can' t wait to see Skyfall because according to the critics is the best Bond movie ever.....",positive
I really love Daniel Craig as the new Bond,positive
by far my favourite 007 flick and the contender for one of the best openings to a action movie. also i loved the way it showed the beginning of bonds 00 status and that it wasnt loaded with gadgets and humor like the previous bond films,positive
A fantastic introduction to Daniel Craig's Bond! Possibly one of the best and certainly the grittiest Bonds ever!,positive
A wonderful introduction to Daniel Craigs Bond definitely shows a different side to 007,positive
"Any doubts of the casting of Daniel Craig as Bond would be completely erased after the first three minutes. A vastly original, masterfully paced action film that completely re-invents and revives the very Genre Bond created. Full of intense action, witty dialogue, and very entertaining drama, Casion Royale is one of the most fun I've had in the movies in a long, long time.",positive
Daniel Craig is fantastic. I'm glad they took this franchise in another direction. The construction site chase has some jaw-dropping stunts.,positive
"One of the best and also the most personal Bond film in the whole series and probably one of the very few films in the series that follows the book's proper portrayal of the the James Bond character. Daniel Craig gives a hard edge performance as a more vulnerable and inexperienced James Bond as the film follows his first adventures as an agent. In contrast to previous Bond films which were full of fancy gadgets and over the top situations, Casino Royale provides a more grounded and realistic take on the story. Along with great action scenes and a very strong supporting cast, Casino Royale is a definitive bond film.",positive
Casino Royale isn't simply the best Bond film in years. It is one of the best Bond films ever.,negative
Bond lost his Love but it makes for a damn good story.One of the bet bond in recent history!You should watch it!,positive
My favorite movie of all of 2006 and easily into my top favs of all time!,positive
"this movie was so good. i liked it a lot. it was cool and very entertaining. i would def watch it again. def one of my favorite bond films ever. me and my bf christopher guerrini, made out during it :).",positive
"A better Bond, and about time.",positive
"Bond, snake called and he wants his CQC back",positive
"""The name's Bond, James Bond"" I am not a fan of all the Bond Movies, but this is enough to make me wanna watch the Next one, with Daniel Craig in it ofcourse. Such grace and sophistication, fits the role.",positive
007 como nunca antes,positive
Best bond film ever! Bond like you've never seen him! Perfection!,positive
A great reboot of the Bond franchise,positive
casino royale disposes of the silliness and gadgetry that plagued recent james bond outings and daniel craig delivers what fans and critics have been waiting for a causitic haunted reinvention of 007,positive
Easily the best Bond since Connery. Dark and moody this is one of the best films of the year.,positive
Daniel Craig has some of the bluest eyes...,positive
Best James Bond... Hands down!,positive
"Bond rebooted, after the disappointment of die another day, bond was on the ropes facing a threat from a new spy franchise featuring Jason Bourne. Would Bond be able to rival what Bourne had done, bond not only rivalled Bourne but smashed it out of the park. Most of the movie revolves around a poker game but the tension and the character plot are believable, this was the best entry in the franchise and ensured people were asking at the end Jason who???",positive
"Truth is after the mess of Skyfall I decided to go back to Daniel Craig's first film, which was considered the big hit! I must say I don't really quite know how they managed to screw up the bonds after Casino Royale. Casino Royale takes down the old gadgetry and science fiction of the previous James Bond providing an example with ""Die Another Day"" and turns into a human James Bond with emotion. This is where action turns phylosophical. Man in 6 years Daniel Craig went from jumping buildings to going old fashioned with shooting guns. Going through I realized how this was a true ""Bond film"", all the elements were in place, its a total re-invention from pierce brosnan. Character Development and plot were both very strong in the film. Damn if I could only be James Bond, except the part where they torture his balls of course.",positive
Daniel Craig and Martin Campbell breathe some much needed life back into the 007 series.,positive
"It's a great action film spectacular. Craig proves his ability to play bond and the supporting performances prove valuable as well throughout the course of the film. The plot is relatively simply but action packed, gritty, and interesting to the very core. You believe Craig is at times an agent in peril as well as at times the sauve agent bond reputation demands. All the interesting well shot and acted scenes lead to and extraordinarily captivating and thrilling climax that will leave any film fan very satisfied. The only problem is the lack of enough comedic material to let bond be bond, like many movies now, the film is too serious like A Bourne film and detracts from the fun comedic and charismatic bond that various generations know and love. Therefore great, engaging, action-packed thriller that I reccomend watching but I must warn any bond fans of possible disappointment as bond seems to have partly lost his roots.",positive
Watching again in anticipation of Skyfall. Great movie!,positive
This one lost me right off the bat with a ridiculous ten-minute opening action sequence but recovered with a decent enough story line afterwards.,negative
By far the best James Bond film I've seen in a long time. Such a refreshing take on Casino Royale. It's a shame David Niven had to ruin it by starring in his own stupid spoof of it.,positive
"Once again Bond was needed to be brought back to earth and back to reality after the absurdity of Die Another Day. Luckily thanks to Daniel Craig's interpretation this is one of the best Bond movies ever, and proved that Bond can still be relevant in the 21st century. The one Bond film which sticks pretty close to the source material, Craig's debut is a fine one and like Dalton did 2 decades earlier, playing a Bond much closer to the Fleming novels, but also refining it and still making the role his own. Fantastic action set pieces, a brilliant supporting cast with one of the most beautiful and well acted Bond girls in the series. Also has the greatest ending to a Bond film ever, with Craig saying those immortal words. Finally Bond was back at his absolute best!",positive
"Finally, a Bond film with BRILLIANT script writing and genuinely emotional performances... SPOILER ALERT!?!?!? - For some odd reason, many think Vesper was bad. WRONG! Here's what happened... While Bond is being tortured, Vesper is being held in a room near by. She's heard screamg. She does so when the guy who eventually bursts in and shoots Cheify gets to her first. let that sink in clearly okay That guy is probably about to kill Vesper but she's like, ""oh please no! I'll give you Bond's money (Poker winnings)later if you let us live."" He's probably like,""aight babe."" Bond and Vesper live as a result Vesper saves Bond She kills herself at the end because she was in deep water (haha) and guilty, as if to redeem her sin somewhat. If she would've lived, Bond and Vesper would've been tracked by the organization for the rest of their days. Now we've a hardened Bond Bitter Sweet.",positive
"In the midst of an underwhelming predecessor(Die Another Day), Casino Royale is possibly the most refreshing installment a franchise could ever have. Daniel Craig's performance as 007 is possibly the best, the character has been depicted with in recent years.",positive
"One of the best Bond films ever. Craig redefines the role of Bond into a less suave, but more believable spy. Throw in the beauty of Eva Green, stunningly creative action scenes, and the ever cool ability to be awesome at poker, and this film is a classic.",positive
"This movie saved the whole James Bond's series. Agent 007 survived from the old fashion gentleman, and returned to the real world. And Daniel is Mr. Right 007.",positive
Daniel Craig might just be my favorite James bond. With the creative plot and great acting. It's hard not to like this movie.,positive
"Awesome movie, Daniel Craig is the best bond yet!",positive
The best bond movie ever!!,positive
"As a life long Bond fan and willing to accept Daniel Craig taking the torch I was disappointed in this film as a 'Bond' movie. In and of it's self Casino Royale is a solid film with Martin Campbell behind the lens and the smart dialog of Wade, Paul & Haggis. That said very little is reminiscent of the Bond franchise here and more Bourne. Bond is now much more brawn than wit in Craig's adaptation in this film which as a fan of the Ian Fleming novels and film series clearly goes against character. Only in the final moments of this picture did it feel that there was a new Bond in town.",negative
Bond done right for the big screen finally.,positive
"Just got back from watching it. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! They start it over, but Daniel Craig makes an AMAZING James Bond. GO 007!!!",positive
"ovo mi je drugi puta da sam gledao film jer sam mu prvi puta dao uzasno nisku ocjenu i rekoh prije skyfalla dat cu craigu novu sansu i drago mi je da jesam... i dalje mislim da glumac nije za bonda, ali film nije uopce toliko los kao sto mi je bio na prvu.... rijec je o jednom vrlo dobrom bond filmu, sa nekim vrhunskim lineovima koji bi trebali zadovoljiti svakog bond fana i sa solidnom radnjom...",negative
great start to a franchise that long waited to see.,positive
"The best James Bond movie in my opinion. Gritty and less emphasis on the gadgets and more on Bond. Craig pulled it off perfectly, exuding so much charisma and G-ness. No I am not quiffing over a sweaty, dirty, muscular Daniel Craig... Anywaaaaayyyyyy, the first 10 minutes had me hooked.. Possibly the greatest chase scene in the history of cinema.",positive
"A good film with excellent action. The critics laud its departure from the silliness, rightly so, but the sheer brutality and a brilliant awareness of pacing is what makes the film excellent.",positive
"Com certeza o melhor filme do 007 com Daniel Graig, ouso dizer ainda, melhor filme da franquia 007!",positive
"Great reboot of the bond film franchise. Putting bond into a ""real world"" style of movie makes it that much better",negative
grounded serious approach to james bond the best so far,positive
"Craig brings a gritty, thuggish quality to the table but lacks charisma.",negative
"Bravo Mr. Craig, Bravo.",positive
My favorite Bond movie,positive
"Movie night with Iris. When i watched it on release i like the grittier edge. And i've been a fan of Craig since his dodgy wigs in 'Our Friends In The North'. However, on 2nd viewing its actually not that good. Its totally freaked out by the Bourne movies, when hey maybe it should just be a Bond film. No humour at all, and product placement, product placement and yes some more product placements. The tech has dated terribly in six years. The poker is dull, and a whole house falls into the Venice canals - yeah right.",negative
Finally got around to seeing this since I've heard good things about Skyfall. Lots of action and double and triple agent hijinks. Not as fun as the Bourne films but still a fun ride.,positive
"Everyone (fans or not) will be screaming ""Thank you God!!"". Casino Royale is a mass improvement over the campy and cheesy look Bond had developed since Sean Connery's time. Its stylishness and the gritty and tightly wound action and suspense make Daniel Craig look like the most haunted and twisted man that Bond really is at heart.",positive
This is one good bloody movie. Sit back and enjoy the best Bond in a long time:-),positive
"Casino Royale proves to be a relentless action flick with cool characters, an intense screenplay that is expertly designed, and an overall exhilarating presentation of the famous movie icon. Daniel Craig is an excellent James Bond, giving more seriousness and an attitude that pleases die-hard fans of the series greatly.",positive
The more I see this movie the more I like it. Classic.,positive
One of the best. Big surprise.,positive
"83% Great acting, average story. However I wouldn't consider it a favorite, but definitely a huge improvement over the original Bond franchise.",positive
"whatever, I just like to watch it",negative
one of the best Bonds.,positive
"2 and a half hour of James Bond reboot. That's bold, dude. And it paid off. I like it that it doesn't dwell too much in the background of James Bond, but as the action goes you can really see how he developed into such an awesome badass intelligent.",positive
"Daniel Craig breathes new life into the character of James Bond after suffering through Pierce Brosnan's last outing in Die Another Day. Not the greatest Bond movie ever, but certainly one of them.",positive
I really enjoyed this new take on Bond. Less reliance on crazy gadgets and a new focus on action.,positive
"like Mission Impossible : Ghost protocol , Disappointing",negative
I've almost given up my hopes on Bond. But finally someone stept in an took their responsibility.,positive
Daniel Craig...well...what more can I say?!,positive
"A great reworking, and Daniel Craig does look good in shorts",positive
"In my opinion, the Best of the Bond Films, period. It doesn't follow the old Bond Formula of previous Bond installments, instead it does something so fresh and exciting. Daniel Craig was incredible off the first bat as a raw, gritter Bond and this movie blew me away back in the theater in 2006; my first Bond movie I have seen in theaters too!",positive
"The action moments in Casino Royale (of which there are many) are unbelievably big, and each one would likely settle for the grand finale in any other movie, but is just one in a series of parts for Daniel Craig's first Bond adventure. Giving James Bond emotional depth doesn't always work (he doesn't seem to learn much despite being told he has near the end), but besides for 2012's Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, I can't think of a over-the-top adventure more fun than Casino Royale.",positive
This is one of those movies that I like.,positive
"Pretty bad film, way over hyped, horribly disapointing shift in bond, and the ""Sillyness and Gadgetry, that plauged the recent films, was A) All of them B) purpose, and it was what made us fall in love with the series. Craig is a good actor, but the writing in this film is awful, it's clearly not intended to be a serious bond film but rather to just cash in on the name. Most disapointing.",negative
"This is one of the best adaptations of Bond in the series. Daniel Craig's performance of Bond is in line with the world as we know of today and he realistically reinvented the character. The film itself also reinvented the series, also being in line with the real world. But the film cannot be complete without its breakneck action and visceral prowess. Two thumbs up to this one.",positive
Now this is a Bond movie!,positive
awsome action scenes,positive
Danial Craig dominates the stage as New M-16 recruit James Bond enters a high stakes poker game.,positive
"Stands as my favorite James Bond movie to date. It has everything. A great bond girl, an awesome car, great action sequences, and quite possibly the best James Bond to date.",positive
Daniel Craig does a damn fine job as Bond,positive
The best James Bond movie in years.,positive
"James Bond does away with the silly gadgets in exchange for a strongplot, script, and characters. Ask his name, and ""You'll Know My Name"" I was a bit bored when they were playing Texas Hold Em, but the film picks up. Casino Royale is fast and exciting!",positive
"Classy, Gritty, Badass Bond.",positive
"Well crafted, this Bond flick is one surprising delight to many. Though the film isn't all action-packed like the previous ones, the story and Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond is something very intriguing.",positive
An absolutely marvelous Bond adventure! Daniel Craig is the best 007 since Sean Connery. This thorough and original adventure turns this incredible franchise from a humorous and family-friendly saga to a hard boiled assassin. Beautifully acted and visually extraordinary!,positive
"It isn't my favorite Bond film, but Casino Royale has some great action scenes and a good debut performance from Daniel Craig, which makes it well worth a watch.",negative
"Some of the best action in blockbusters, and some of the most thrilling moments you may ever find, EVER.",positive
Daniel CRAIG IS A SEXY THUG!! lol,positive
"""Casino Royale"" throws up in the air just about every cool cliche you could name, twists spotted from miles away, multiple endings -- and it's still the best ""Bond"" ever made. I haven't been able to get it out of my head. A visceral blockbuster of a looks-to-kill whammy, ""Royale"" also has the most soulful Bond yet in Daniel Craig, steely eyes putting the character's every stare on either side of a killer and a man about to break. Cheers to Martin Campbell for pulling all stops and reinventing the franchise in a movie that shoots nowhere but up. He just made shit cool again. Fingers crossed ""Skyfall"" is this unforgettable.",positive
Connery may be the best James Bond... but this is the best James Bond FILM thus far,positive
Daniel Craig id definetly the best James Bond to date!,positive
"Great Bond film, best since goldeneye",positive
"Great Bond film, best since goldeneye",positive
One of my fav films with Daneil Craig.,positive
best james bond reboot ever i believe,positive
How could anyone justify saying that anything was wrong with this movie. By far the best Bond to date.,positive
"Good direction for the 007 films to go in, and Daniel Craig was great!",positive
One of the best bond films. Great acting and great story but a little long.,positive
One of the best bond films,positive
"With all the talk of Skyfall, I decided to finally start catch up on these. And I must say, Daniel Craig plays a fantastic James Bond.",positive
"With a powerful performance from Daniel Craig, Casino Royale delivers with brutality, an excellent script and plot, and a particularly memorable ending--this is the Bond film we've all been looking for.",positive
"Rock an roll, Daniel!",positive
The best Bond film. Explains everything about why Bond is Bond. The grittiest bond since Connery and even more so. One of the best re-boots of all time.,positive
"Great film. Some parts were hard to follow and some of the character's accents were hard to understand but the acting is great, the action is great, and the drama is great. It's all great. :)",positive
"In anticipation of the new Bond film â~Skyfallâ(TM), out in a couple of weeks, I thought Iâ(TM)d take a look at the last two in the series, starting (of course) with Daniel Craigâ(TM)s debut; Casino Royale. For the record, yes, I have seen it before and very much enjoyed it. Itâ(TM)s been quite a while since my first look so it will be interesting to see how it fairs. Hereâ(TM)s a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts. Having lost his clientsâ(TM) money in a scheme foiled by James Bond; financier to the criminal underworld, Le Chiffre, arranges a high-stakes poker game at the Casino Royale in Montenegro (not Monte Carlo as many mistakenly think). Of course Bond has a seat and he has a beautiful woman on his arm; Vesper Lynd, who represents the treasury who are staking Bond. His aim; to prevent Le Chiffre from wining and gaining back his reputation. There are many bluffs and counter bluffs but you know Bond will win out in the endâ¦ But at what cost? Iâ(TM)ll leave it there, the Spoiler Police will be pleased with me today as Iâ(TM)ve kept it particularly vague. Very well made with, as ever, some great music supplied by David Arnold. There are also some great locations (as expected) and some quite breathtaking stunt work (hats off to those guys). I thought Daniel Craig was excellent as Bond; he really brings the character up to date and gives him a lot more edge; something that had been lacking in his more recent predecessors. Eva Green did an excellent job as Vesper Lynd; vulnerable when needed but also quite sassy at times. And now the bad guy; Mads Mikkelsen plays Le Chiffre with just the right amount of menace, nicely done! I will also give a mention to; Judi Dench as M, she was excellent as ever, Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter and Giancarlo Giannini as Rene Mathis. There is quite a lot of action before things focus on the Casino; all of this is well done and features much of the stunt work in the film. I have to say it does appear to get a little lost once the main focus of the film is established. Once we do get there the scenes in and around the Casino are quite compelling and it is here that we actually get a feeling for how Daniel Craig portrays Bond. He has vulnerabilities that make him appear more human and this in turn gives the audience a chance to understand his motivations. I must admit I really enjoyed Craigâ(TM)s portrayal and am looking forward to more of the same. As for the film as a whole; I very much enjoyed it. Very entertaining with everything weâ(TM)ve come to expect from a Bond film, and more. SteelMonsterâ(TM)s verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.5/10",positive
"The creators have eliminated so many of the great things that made Bond, Bond. But, Casino Royale succeeds without them. It's still difficult for me to consider it a true 007 film, instead of a complete franchise reboot.",positive
"Awesome Bond movie! Daniel Craig is awesome! So, how did James Bond become 007? This movie answers that question. Action, drama, & suspense done Bond style. This movie is tied for my favorite Bond movie of all time with Thunderball. Only 1 James Bond movie for Daniel Craig so far, and already he's my second favorite Bond behind Sean Connery. It's hard to beat an original classic like Sean Connery, but Daniel Craig comes very close. No wonder Daniel Craig played James Bond in the 2012 summer olympic opening ceremony. Highly recommended Bond flick! =)",positive
"Uma Ã³tima renovaÃ§Ã£o para a franquia em tempos pÃ³s-11 de Setembro. Apesar de um rÃ¡pido momento confuso de ediÃ§Ã£o no fim (protagonizada por Eva Green, como Vesper Lynn), este beira a perfeiÃ§Ã£o. http://santuariodomestreryu.blogspot.com",positive
"combines actin wih laughs with ease, the bollock scene is quality (sounds wrong but actually isnt)",positive
Why did the director of Green Lantern do so good with this movie but he did so bad with Green Lantern (2011)?,positive
Best BOND movie so far! Looking forward to SkyFall.,positive
The word 'Perfect' is just not enough.,positive
"Ever though how James Bond got his start? Was he ever vulnerable to women? Was he always the perfect British Intelligence Agent? Was Daniel Craig a worthy enough Bond? All these questions are explored in this film, and boy does Daniel Craig make every other Bond look bad, when you see his take on the character. With the previous Bond film 'Die Another Day' in 2002 was ridiculed by audiences and critics alike, criticized for it's ridiculously stupid gadgets and over-the-top storyline. In realm of audiences wanting realism and gritty, Casino Royale delivers on all ends. James Bond doesn't drive an Aston Martin, until the 3rd act, he drives around a Ford to begin with. The film shows, how he became Bond and follows him through his 1st mission, which involves taking out criminal banker 'Le Chiffre' in a high stakes poker game. Now, as a novice in poker and having had no previous knowledge, the cardplay does give a little knowledge to people unfamiliar with the game and it's hell of entertaining too, because of the choice of music and shot sizes, close-ups galore. Another point in every James Bond review always has to be the critique of the Bond Girl. Eva Green plays Vesper Lynd, and unlike most Bond girls, this one actually has a brain, no offense to any other Bond girl, but they just felt like a throwaway character put in the film for the hell of it, don't believe me? Watch Diamonds are Forever, beautiful Bond girl, completely pointless character. In Casino Royale, Vesper Lynd, is actually taking part of the risk Bond is, she is giving him the money for the poker game. Le Chiffre portrayed by Mads Mikkelsen, is menacing but also controllable, something new for the Bond villains too, the rest seem unstoppable. See, every character has very noticeable strong trait and then they have a very noticeable weakness. Something the previous Bond films didn't have, James Bond always looked unstoppable, like the villains. A fresh revamp for the James Bond franchise. A truly great character piece and the Best James Bond Film ever made!",positive
"The ridicolous gadgets that previous entries overused is gone. Instead we've received the reboot 007 needed that is intense, well acted and has very entertaining action sequences that all come together to make an unforgettable Bond experience.",positive
"Daniel Craig is great, the pace is tense, the action is amazing, and the plot/script is awesome. Oh, and the Poker is highly entertaining.",positive
"it goes right back to the basics, even to when brosnan first started out and focuses on the story and then gives the action an extra kick, and then some, it brings back the brutality and grit of the dalton years, the suave charm of moore and the true awe of connery while retaining the immense thrills of the brosnan years, this is truly one of the definitive bond films",positive
"The only good part in this is when he is being tortured and starts laughing. He said ""Now people will know the last thing you did before you died was scratch my balls.""",negative
The poker scenes are just awful.,negative
Unstoppable and action packed.,positive
One of the best chase scenes I've ever seen at the beginning. Goes downhill from there.,positive
"Love Daniel Craig as Bond, I found the poker games all while fairly intense, just boring. Still my favorite Bond film to date. Thank god there aren't any of those horrrrrrriiiibbbbbblllleeee punchlines.",positive
"Daniel Craig is badass. Favorite moment: As Bond comes to after being defibrillated, first words he says in his bewilderedness is, ""you ok?""",positive
"Casino Royale is proof that character development pays off, even in 007 films.",positive
"I have found it very hard to compare Bond movies, because I love the action that they consist of, but this one is one of my favorites. Daniel Craig will be a great new Bond!",positive
Best James Bond film.,positive
"Craig does an amazing job as Bond, managing to present a troubled and flawed rendition of the character.",positive
I hate it that the Corvette didn't make it. :(,positive
I'm going to try watch and rate all of these before Skyfall. That'll be a lot easier with the new Blu ray box set. This movie gets everything right.,positive
In this Bond movie Craig adds intensity and a newer look to our favorite MI-6 agent.,positive
"While I haven't seen many of the films in the Bond franchise I have to admit Casino Royale is pretty bad ass! The opening chase sequence is probably the highlight of the film but the usual gadgets, cars and fashion keep the viewer engaged from start to finish.",positive
thrilling in every way,positive
"As ever, I'm a bit behind the times and have only just seen this but I was impressed. Craig plays a tougher Bond after the suave gloss of Brosnan. It works really well and I hope its the beginning of a strong series",positive
maybe the best Bond that i have ever seen,positive
"The Bond franchise was becoming stale, this Bond hits the spot.",positive
blah I was a little bored...,negative
In my opinion the best Bond so far.,positive
James Bond-rough & realistic The card game-suspense to the max! Action scenes-unbelievable but great,positive
"One of the best, if not THE best Bond film ever, and one of the best action adventure thrillers ever made. Brutal, thrilling, glamorous and massively entertaining, this is a complete revision of the character, bringing Bond not only back to basics but giving us a more gritty, shockingly bloody, suspenseful and hard edged take on the series that harks back to Ian Flemings original creation, whilst still delivering fantastic, beautiful location hopping escapism of the highest order.",positive
This ain't your daddy's Bond! Daniel Craig has finally captured the Bond that Fleming wrote! Great movie! Can't wait for the next one!,positive
"Really enjoyed this movie, Daniel Craig is awesome as the new bond. this movie takes away the chessieness that brosnan had",positive
a completely new direction for the bond franchise which works! Craig creates a bond that is actually human!,positive
"was wiked loved it, love the song at the begining",positive
"1/5/07 - Casino Royale is the best Bond film to date. It had lots of good action and intrigue. The plot keeps you guessing, but slows down a bit at the end. It's pretty dark for a Bond film. If you look really close, you can catch a glimpse of Compass Point in the background as Bond is driving!",positive
"Without any doubt the best Bond so far. Yes, i said it.",positive
"not so good for a bond movie, maybe i just don't like daniel craig that much. =)",negative
after all of the hype that Daniel Craig does not deserve to be James Bond (I'm one of them... rooting for Clive Owen to be the next bond)... I think Craig did his job to humanize James Bond and Eva green is just jaw-dropping gorgeous.... nicely done... all of the James Bond elelments are really for Craig...,positive
and the credits r the best,positive
My favourite Bond film,positive
"A new Bond for a new era, Craig is the most relentless Bond yet, but also the most human. Long gone are the ridiculous gadgets and outlandish plots and villains, which have been replaced by beautiful locales, fantastic action set pieces, excellent performances and a smart and very thrilling plot.",positive
Absolutely loved it...and I am SO going to buy it when it's out on DVD!!,positive
Best James Bond yet!,positive
"The best Bond movie in a looooong time. And yeas, Daniel Craig is as good a Bond as Connery was. There. I said it.",positive
BuenÃ­sima pelÃ­cula. Por fin un James Bond Sangrante...,positive
"In comparison to the last Bond It's one wild ride, with Craig doing well as the new Bond, and is the best since Sean Connery's days as 007. When watching Casino Royale, be weary that there are 3 different places where it is expected to finish. It seems that even things that will happen are never as they seem in the rebirth of the hit franchise.",positive
LOVe it!!!!!!!!! Saw it 11 times in the theater! plus daniel craig is sexy!,positive
"Much better than I originally remembered. I think I was paying more attention, as I picked up things in the story I hadn't realised previously. Definitely a good start for Daniel Craig's 007 career, IMO.",positive
"La pelicula con menos accion de James Bond ha resultado ser sin duda la mejor, paradojico?, no, simplemente es lo que hay que hacer: resucitar a Bond no como un heroe imposible si no como un implacable hijo de puta en un entorno de espionaje mas creible, menos fantasioso y espectacular, renunciando al Bond clasico, pero creando de cero un personaje mucho mas interesante, implacable y amoral, mucho mas cercano al Bond de Flemming.",positive
"As I get older I seem to be growing tired of James Bond and his shenanigans. The movie had some good intrigue and suspense, but after the main dramatic arc is finished, the movie keeps going and takes a rather odd turn. The ultimate goal of this drawn out ending may be to show why Bond never treats women as anything other than sex objects throughout his career, but it was a long trip to get to that little piece of character development.",negative
"This, to me, is one of the better Bond movies",positive
The perfect Bond film.,positive
Perhaps the best 'Bond'. Nearly perfect.,positive
"Like this kind of Bond film, no to campy and gadgets, yes to more character development of James Bond and the action scenes feel realistic as possible, more grittier that most of the Bond movies, the only flaw in this film is the torture scene, if that scene was cut from the film in my opinion, the running time of the film would be 137 mins",positive
"With Daniel Craig playing James Bond (taking over from Pierce Brosnan), a whole new story and beginning, great directing by Martin Campbell (who also directed GoldenEye, another James Bond film), and exciting sequences and stunts, which includes an amazing opening chase sequence, Casino Royale is the James Bond film we've been waiting for and it delivers on every level.",positive
Daniel Craig brings the 007 franchise roaring back to life as possibly the greatest and most convincing James Bond's to date.,positive
"I've only seen a few Bond movies, and this is definitely the best one. It might change after I see Skyfall, but for now, Grade: A-",positive
Better the 2nd time.,positive
This James Bond is definitely shaken and not stirred.,positive
"They called it the rebirth of Bond, and they were right. I grew up with Pierce Brosnan as my James Bond and Goldeneye was my godly spy film. When I saw Casino Royale with Daniel Craig, I had the exact same feeling. It was that good. If you ever even liked Bond films just a little bit, this is the one to see. Such a good film.",negative
How bond became Bond. Daniel craig and Sean Connery are the best Bonds.,positive
Daniel c... Is the best bond after Sean c.. I said it!,positive
It took a lot of balls to turn the campness of Bond into balls-to-the-wall action. And it paid off.,positive
best bond yet. Daniel Craig made a big impact with this movie,positive
"Easily the best Bond and strictly because it totally ignored its predecessors; a bold and risky move. Also, clearly genius because of the lack of gadgetry and raw stylish feel. Can't say enough good.",positive
I dont care that he is blond. It a very good movie. Has you at the edge of your seat the whole time..,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond in decades.,positive
"Daniel Craig shines in his first major starring role playing an inexperienced and very vulnerable Bond. This film restarts the franchise apparently, and if it does, then we can forget about future garbage such as Tomorrow Never Dies and Hugo Drax.",positive
This is a brilliant film. Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond. Action Tension Drama Comedy all in. Another film I watch all the time. 10/10,positive
It was good to see how James became 007 & there was a lot of action i think Daniel Craig should be Bond from now on,positive
Better then I expected. I look forward to seeing more of this James Bond. No pun intended.,positive
Basic Bond... Back to classic,positive
"Daniel Craig is not only good to look at, he makes a great Bond - next to Sean Connery",positive
I just can't seem to get into the 007 movies. I was bored by this one.,negative
"Watching this film again, there is absolutely nothing I don't like about it and it is my favorite bond film right next to Skyfall. Casino Royale did for James Bond what Batman Begins did for Batman. Take a character we really love and make a deep, thought provoking, character driven, and gritty reinvention of it. After the dud that was Die Another Day, Bond comes back better than ever to show people that he is a real human being and not just some spy out to save the world from some maniacal genius. Daniel Craig was literally a perfect casting choice for the role of James Bond. He shows perfectly that he is a badass, can please the ladies, some more wide range of emotions, and have a little sense of humor too. I like to go back and forth to myself on who is the better James Bond, Daniel Craig, Pierce Brosnan, or Sean Connery The villain here is a realistic one and one of the most captivating of the entire series. Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre played such a great menacing foe for James Bond and far better than some of the previous Bond villains. He is not a villain out to rule the world but to try to win money for people that he owes and are more dangerous than he is because his life is on the line and it is more intriguing to watch than some british idiot trying to use a giant laser to destroy army bases like on Die Another Day. One of the most highly praised aspects of this film are the action scenes. They are truly mind blowing. They are all tense, realistic, fast-paced, and most of all exciting as hell. The action here is practical and all brilliant stunt work. The foot chase in Madagascar, the truck chase in the airport, the stairwell fight at Casino Royale, and the action sequence towards the finale. They all stand out so well and all those action scenes I can watch over a thousand times and still be wowed every time. Beside the action, the story and characters are just as great here. The story is actually interesting here and you feel that the stakes are really high as the film goes on. The team of writers come up with such amazing dialogue for these characters to say and not once does the dialogue ever fall flat. James Bond has to stop Le Chiffre from winning a high stakes poker game to help the funding of terrorism stop and he has the help of Vesper Lynd played by Eva Green. Vesper Lynd is one of the best bond girls of all time right next to Natalia from Goldeneye. Not only was she sexy, she was also an interesting character to watch, wasn't just some throwaway sex object to look at, and her chemistry with James Bond was dynamic to watch giving out the most versatile relationship I have ever seen in a James Bond movie. They even shared a really tender moment together that I even shed a tear on and that has never ever happened to me when watching a 007 film. Martin Campbell shows us when he is behind a bond film, it is engaging as ever and he knows exactly how to thrill and wow movie fans around the world. He successfully launches the bond careers of Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig and he brings the character right into the 21st century and makes the James Bond franchise more intriguing than ever. Overall, needless to say I love every single thing about this film and it is now my current favorite James Bond film right next to Skyfall, highly deserving of my highest rating that I can give on this website.",positive
"long overdue re-launch. As a huge Bond fan, great to see reality and belief return to the franchise.",negative
LOVED IT! Daniel Craig is the best James Bond!,positive
Daniel craig is the best bond. Ever.,positive
One of my favorite action movies and my favorite Bond film.,positive
"One of the best Bond films so far, and perhaps the most down - to - earth.",positive
"Bond is reborn, new and ready for action. Craig plays the character well and gives Bond an edge of killing without care I feel the other bonds lacked. Casino Royale is an interesting story, action-packed, and full of beautiful women, as usual.",positive
Daniel Craig i think will be an awesome new bond,positive
"Bon, ai du mal avec Daniel Craig catalogué ""méchant vilain"" depuis les Sentiers de la Perdition (Road to Perdition). Mais Eva Green (envoutante) relève le niveau, même si on a un peu perdu la classe british au profit de mêlées explosives de partout.",negative
"not what I expected, but good",positive
"So he's blond..I still like Mr. Connery, don't get me wrong..but after that swimsuit scene (sexy grrr ) can you blame me for being a fan..? Besides, it's a good movie..or so I hear..my mind kinda went blank after that blue..tight..",positive
"It differs itself as a Bond movie because it works as a fantastic standalone film. The association with the James Bond license only makes it stand out more amongst the other, weaker films. Fantastically paced and set in a more ""real"" universe, the movie is only aided by Craig.",positive
"Full of action and with an enseble cast, Casino Royale is a great maybe the best James Bond movie with Daniel Craig as top perform.",positive
"There's always been something wrong with the 007 franchise that I could never quite put my finger on. Last year I went ahead and bought the entire 20 film saga on dvd and sudddenly it hit me. Those movies were all retarded. Now I'm a HUGE Bond fan and have been since I could barely walk, but for me, like so many others, the appeal to these movies is nostalgia, the warm feelings we appreciate for seeing these movies that we, like our parents or even grandparents appreciated in their youth. There's a mystique and a certain charm to these movies, but they're absolutely ridiculous. But as fans, we take them with a grain of salt and look past the sillyness to appreciate what makes Bond, well, Bond. So here comes Casino Royale, and entirely new approach at the Bond schema. Essentially, it takes Bond and turns him into a real person, with genuine emotion and flaws. He isn't a superhero yet, but someone with talent who's prone to mistakes. It does something none of the 007 films have done to date, it makes Bond believable. It gives him humanity, yet all the while sets in place the foundation for the old pro we all know and love. Not only that, but it gives us some of the best action sequences in Bond history, sans ridiculous gimmicky gadgets and laugh-out-loud funny jitsu chops. By the end, you'll see Bond beaten and drenched in his own, and others', blood. There's humor here too, but not in the form of cheesy one-liners, but rather genuine wit and banter. In all honesty, I was skeptical of Craig as the new Bond, but he has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is easily the best Bond of them all. He has a classical handsomeness that matches Connery, but with a seriousness and wit that doesn't come off as creepy or ridiculous. All in all, the movie is riveting and a major triumph.",positive
Daniel Craig made me a Bond fan! Wow!!,positive
"nice straight flush, followed by amazing recovery from torture at the hands of the evil terrorist, then the death of the only woman he could ever love ... a bit over the top, but hey, its 007",negative
I've never really got into the JAmes Bond 007 movies but this was a great start to getting into it.,positive
"Daniel Craig is a welcome new face for the Bond franchise, but it goes on and on and on. And Eva Green isn't all that convincing or exciting as the love interest.",negative
"Casino Royale nos entrega a un James Bond muy diferente a todos los demas, Un Bond frio aparentemente sin sentimientos. Pero fue un gran acierto el personaje, que logra conectar con el espectador. La trama es muy buena, con buenas escenas de accion y personalmente agradezco que no se abusara de los super gadgets que hacian a las peliculas de 007 un poco fuera de la realidad.",positive
"With a fresh start and a darker turn for the series, Casino Royale harkens back to the Ian Flemming novels, with Daniel Craig playing the most authentic version of Bond to date--an aggressive, tortured character who is haunted by the monster he has become.",positive
Superb script and characterization. My favs Bond.,positive
7.5/10 good movie I think Daniel Craig takes James bond character to another level It's more gritty and still has the James bond appeal cannno wait to see the second one and then see the third in November!!!! but this is a great kickoff to start Daniel's tenure as James bond,positive
A great reboot of the franchise with a fresh new look at 007,positive
One of the best Bond films ever.,positive
"One of the greatest spy/action movies ever. Daniel Craig gives a powerhouse performance and manages to really humanize the Bond character, which is a pretty refreshing change from the clean cut superhero-esque nature of Pierce Brosnans Bond.",positive
Daniel Craig is HOT!,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond yet.,positive
"Greatly acted, amazingly written, some cool fight scenes, and a fantastic performance from Daniel Craig. Casino Royale will delight 007 fans and win new fans as well. Rating: 95%/ Overall: Fantastic",positive
A nice breath of fresh air from the gadget and flair-focused Bond films of recent years.,positive
"89% = ***1/2 = Amazing""",positive
"Completely revolutionized my view of 007, the MI6 Agent who has the license to kill. Bond in here now portrayed a cold blooded killer and a loose cannon his Handler M has to put on a leash. This really creates interesting tension between Bond and his superiors, often depicting him as a rouge agent. What other amazing cast pick as Daniel Craig to play as 007? I persoanlly love his pick! The movie strips the genre of espionage back to old fashion, minus the fancy and almost unrealistic gagetry and gives a pretty well written story to go to.",positive
"My favorite Bond film that bests even Goldfinger. The franchise receives an excellent reboot thanks to the excellent story and its new Bond, Daniel Craig. A blonde James Bond with piercing blue yes, Craig is as deadly as all his other screen predecessors, if not more so. Containing multiple highly intense action set pieces, it is a film that almost everyone will enjoy. A magnificent achievement.",positive
I love the James Bond dude he is cool !!!!!!,positive
"I like the new take on the series. This particular film was a bit slow at times, and it was hard to follow at certain points. It was a good film overall, though.",positive
the best bond film with the best bond. only makes sense,positive
Definitely the best James Bond film and easily one of the best action films ever.,positive
"Absolutely fantastic! This will certainly be the best James Bond film in my books. It has such patience when it comes to the poker table scenes and builds tension between the two main characters, that being James Bond and La Chiffre. The action scenes are well done and makes you want to see the last move James has to pull off to wipe that evil face off his opponent!",positive
"This is the first of the Bond films that stars Daniel Craig and is the first Bond film that has been made for a few years and luckily they have not forgotten how to make a good film. I think people were a bit sceptical about Daniel Craig playing the role but I think he did a very good job and I think he is actually one of the best Bonds. This film is done in the usual bond style with a great story, excellent action (with some epic chase scenes) and some witty one liners that add a good comedic element to the film. Overall this is a brilliant film that follows the tried and tested formula. (you can tell Daniel Craig is a successful Bond because at the time of writing this he is about to finish his third bond film Skyfall, which would not have happened if people di not think he was any good)",positive
Action super director Martin Campbell returns to the James Bond series and brings with him the reinvigoration the world's number one spy so desperately needed and deserved. With Daniel Craig as 007 Casino Royale proved that James Bond is at his best not when surrounded by ludicrous villains and gadgets but when he is given the chance to be realistic.,positive
"Before this one, i thought james bond was a sex symbol; but after this one, i realized he kicks ass as well..",positive
Craig mixes the modern and old-style Bonds perfectly to create a fresh 007. The casting for the villians and a Bond girl were great. The plot adds to the reinvigorated James Bond.,positive
"Great Bond movie. Daniel Craig brings a darker, more violent edge to the Bond series. This film has a great story and stays true to all the elements that make up a good 007 movie. The only part I didn't like was when Bond drove up to a resort in a Ford Fusion. That just didn't seem right.",positive
daniel craig is the best bond ever !,positive
Who don't like a little bond once in awhile?,negative
"The name's bond. James Bond. ""Casino Royal"" is the best adaptation of the James Bond legacy yet, and Daniel Craig sizzles as the lead, bolstering a strong, in depth performace, and portraying one of the most iconic characters in film history with perfection. This is the best Bond film ever made, and I can hardly wait for ""Skyfall.""",positive
"Awesome. One of, if not the best James Bond movie ever.",positive
100% thrilling and classy!,positive
This is just marvellous,negative
"The atrociousness of Die Another Day resulted in Pierce Brosnan's departure from the series and a 4-year hiatus. However, the wait is well worth it as Casino Royale (based on the first novel by James Bond creator Ian Fleming) effectively takes 007 back to his darker, more grounded roots as a haunted and vulnerable assassin for Her Majesty's Secret Service. The campy, self-parody style of the more recent Bond films called for a complete series makeover, to the point that everything is completely rebooted for the first time in 007's 44 year cinematic history. Daniel Craig plays James Bond perfectly, and is by far the most faithful interpretation of the original character that we have ever seen (looks aside). He brings a sense of realism and intensity to the role that makes him the most interesting James Bond since Sean Connery. The movie itself is beautifully filmed, with the most stunning cinematography since You Only Live Twice, and the action sequences are much more intense and exciting than ever before. Eva Green's Vesper Lynd is a perfect for for this interpretation of Bond, and her role is both relevant and necessary to the story. Mads Mikkelsen plays a subtly intense Le Chiffre, and truly comes across as threatening. The torture sequence is well-adapted and intense, and the final sequence is among the best Bond scenes ever. The film as a whole is very respectful to its source material, and the additions/updates to the story are done with reverence and skill. This film revolutionizes the series in every way.",positive
Just another Bond movie.,negative
Daniel Craig oozes sex appeal and charisma as the newest actor to take on 007! His steely interpretation of the character propels this kinetic and swiftly paced film forward at a breathless and invigorating pace!,positive
This is without a doubt the best Bond film ever.,positive
"Daniel Craig has to be the WORST James Bond ever to have been spawned from the diluded minds of Hollywood. Maybe its just me? The revempt and slaughtered new version of James Bonds is at time pretentious and pining to be ""Sophisticatedly clever"" instead comes off as fumbled and misconstruted. Sure its stylish with Armani Tailers, and gritty action.",negative
"I'm a die-hard Bond fan, and I'll go against tradition and admit that this is the best Bond movie and Daniel Craig is the best James Bond",positive
"Awesome old school Bond action-adventure! Daniel Craig is the best 007 since Sean Connery. The action is great, the acting is realistic, and the plot is just as engrossing as the classics.",positive
A breath of fresh air from a series that started to go downhill with Brosnan's last film. Daniel Craig was pure beefcake in the film.,positive
"Easily the best bond movie. And its also the one that follows the books the closest as well. Bond isnt about the gadgets and stupid one liners. No, he is an assassin that carries out his missions in a very brutal manner!",positive
"I have to admit that I wasn't a James Bond fan prior to seeing this film, but this film inspired me to check out the rest of the films. Can't tell you how it stands up as a Bond film, but I can say it is a brilliant action film!",positive
"For an action movie, Casino Royale is surprisingly dull",negative
"i wasnt sure how i would feel about a new James Bond, of which i was sad because they replaced Pierce Brosnan, but this movie you will simply LOVE, the action is amazing.",positive
"Lots of action, good plot, great eye candy per usual for a 007 flick",positive
One of thy best Bond films,positive
I thought there could never be another James bond but this one is sooooooooooo differant he like to kill and not be with the ladys,positive
"snows flying, popcorns cooking, going to spend some time with James Bond on this snow evening..bring its on :)",positive
The best Bond film to date.,positive
"The best Bond film of them all, and dangerously close to being one of the best action movies of all time. and that's saying something.",positive
"Taking a cue from ""Batman Begins,"" this brings the world's most famous secret agent back to his roots and for the first time, we see how he goes from being James Bond to 007. With all due respect to his predecessors, Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery (yeah, I said it!) and the film is absolutely riveting and never stops. The script is tight, the pacing is fast, furious, but not confusing and the performances are great, making this, in my opinion, the best Bond movie ever. And the pay-off - Craig uttering the immortal ""Bond. James Bond,"" as the last lines as the 007 theme plays for the first time in the film - is one of the best in cinema history.",positive
wow i love tese kinds of movies!,negative
"I liked this newer grittier more rugged James Bond. As usual in James Bond movies, excellent opening action sequence. History dictates that this is always my favorite part of James Bond movies. Prior to Daniel Craig, Pierce was my favorite Bond,and that remains, purely because i got fed up up with Craig's pouting.Half a point lost for that.",positive
"James Bond: Why is it that people who can't take advice always insist on giving it?  ""The Pawn. The Con. The Bond."" Casino Royale eclipsed, in my mind, any James Bond movie ever. That's including the Sean Connery ones. When I think of Bond now, I think of Daniel Craig and this movie. Ditching all the silliness that many of the older Bond movies incorporated; Casino Royale is an absolutely pulse pounding auctioneer from start to finish. It also is a film with a brain to go along with its balls. The chases are spectacular, the camera work is spot on, and the acting is cool. It's a good old fashioned thrill ride and the 144 minute runtime couldn't have felt shorter. That's always a good sign.  Casino Royale is a great introduction to James Bond virgins. We get to see how James Bond got his start, with his first mission. Bond has just been made a secret agent and is put to the test when he is asked to make sure a financier of terrorism doesn't win a high stakes poker game. That synopsis doesn't exactly go into detail, but that's the perfect amount of knowledge to go into the movie with. Let me just tell you, there's a lot more action than just card playing. Bond jumps from buildings, climbs walls; just about anything action related you can think of, he does. This movie works so well because of a variety of reasons, but most importantly it is Daniel Craig as Bond. He's absolutely perfect. He has the look and the talk of Bond. He looks classy, but also physical. He is athletic, but also has that sense of intelligence. And his screen presence with the ladies is also perfect. All these things are vital when looking at what makes a good 007. Craig has all the traits, just as Connery did.  I'll admit, I was never the biggest Bond fan. I've never been all that thrilled with a Bond movie, and I've seen many of the classics. I was thrilled by this one. Casino Royale is everything a smart, action movie should be. It's thrilling, sexy, and fast. I'm sure there are some huge Bond fans out there that look to one of the Connery movies as the defining film in this long, long franchise. I think I'll always look to this one though. That is unless the Christopher Nolan rumor is true, and he gets to make a Bond film. You know that would be fucking awesome. James Bond: The name's Bond... James Bond. ",positive
"I don't want to say I was skeptical when I heard that the reset button was pressed on the James Bond adventure that was 40 years in the making. But if you had to reboot it all, why not begin Ian Fleming's first Bond adventure? Even though Daniel Craig proved everyone wrong, the story legitimized him as an official Bond & everything else was history. Mads Mikkelson was a great ""Le Chiffre"" & Eva Green brought ""Vesper Lynd"" to life. Jeffrey Wright also gave ""Felix Leiter"" a great intro & I hope he isn't eaten by a shark like in ""Licence To Kill"". And did this Bond bite off of Jason Bourne's swag. NO, but I'll bet it inspired the writers to bring us the best James Bond story, ever told.",positive
Very impressed considering the last Bond series was a few years before this.,positive
Brilliant reboot but the plot is quite complicated.,positive
Okay. Not the best Bond movie.,positive
It was actually a good movie.,positive
"A return of the serious Bond that was in the 2nd outing and it's even more serious than Russia, a great example on how to do a reboot",positive
"Combining a deconstructionist approach with one of the most famous characters in spy fiction, Casino Royale show cases some of Campbell's finest direction and a standout performance from Craig.",positive
"Craig is Bond. Bringing more depth and intensity to the role than anyone before him, Daniel rivals even Sean Connery as the best double-oh in movie history.",positive
"If there's one thing we don't need, it's another reboot, especially if it's a Bond reboot. James Bond is a character that is now synonymous with fads that have long since overstayed their welcome. The original Bond films started off as really good, but then became tedious as the years went by and as they kept making so many. The Pierce Brosnan films tried making the franchise edgy again, but ultimately fell prey to the much of the same old clichés, to the point that the franchise would once again collapse under the weight of its own silliness. This film tried to change all that by reinventing the character as a gritty, post-Bourne action hero, and it's all too apparent that the producers have missed the point of the character entirely. This new Bond is ugly and fights like a street thug, and with all the charm of a poor man's Mark Harmon. Considering the film itself, saying that about the guy is extremely generous. I know that much of the plot in a Bond film is mainly just a giant excuse to parade around a handsome actor, but in the case of this film, the plot is really boring and thin. The producers stretch it out for as long as possible, seemingly oblivious to the fact that the guy they're showing off for two hours is a total bore, and that whole scene where he gets tortured just seems like a pointless attempt to give depth to a character that has is incapable of such in a modern context. For me, that's the entire problem with this film. It attempts to put an embarrassingly dated character and franchise into a modern context, and yet Bond simply doesn't work in a modern context at all. Without the suave Bond just seems like a neutered spy trying to be Jason Bourne just because that was the next big thing at the time. Of course, one argue that the Bond franchise is a lot better without the silliness and gadgetry that plagued the older films, but what we get instead is arguably much worse, and even more repetitive in the films to come. The film may have been competently produced, as can be seen from the visuals and the realistic action scenes, but it's worth nothing if the film as a whole cannot entertain. By this point, Bond is deader than disco, so why can't we just accept it?",negative
Best Bond movie yet!,positive
A great turn for Mr.Bond,positive
One if the best action films ever made and the best Bond film to date!,positive
"Intense, fun, and charming, Casino Royale is the new direction and breath of fresh air that the series so badly needs.",positive

Best Bond film made. Great action and story.,positive
Daniel Craig is awesome as Bond,positive
"After watching all of them, no disrespect to Sean Connery but this is the best bond movie to date. Bond as a human without any gadgets! Can't get enough of it!",positive
"Liking Daniel Craig's Bond. Not as cute as Pierce, but I like him.",positive
Just watched it for the second time...blown away by the Innuendos! (no pun intended),positive
"Simply superb. A thrilling, exciting and engaging Bond flick. The best bond film ever made.",positive
A complete reboot of the franchise. Craig has got to be the best since Lazenby due to the fact that his role is witty and action-packed. Please try not to laugh at the torture scene though. Thank you.,positive
Best Bond movie ever,positive
"I've come to realize in recent years that I am just not a fan of James Bond films. The franchise is weak, repetitive and ultimately unsatisfying, relying on the same mechanics film after film. Casino Royale happens to be an exception. The film takes Bond back to it's roots allowing a more inexperienced and flawed character to be displayed, which therefore finally makes him human. By technically rebooting the series, we get a new actor and Daniel Craig truly owns this role. He is by far the best and most talented actor to take on thia infamous role. It is his humane charismatic charm that makes this film more than flashy craftsmanship. I was very impressed with this installment and the cast and crew involved.",positive
I never thought watching a poker game would be so suspenseful. Overall a great movie.,positive
"It has all the guns, girls, and gadgets you would expect but never feels too cliche. Daniel Craig is a perfect Bond. He has the suave that you'd expect from the character, but adds a edginess that feels like should have always been there. What he takes away though is some of the fun.",negative
"Una pelicula casi perfecta , sino fuera por unos detalles le daria el 5 de 5 , pero aun asi Casino Royale es mi pelicula preferida del 007 , pero Craig no es mi Bond favorito , pero aun asi hace una excelente interpretaciÃ²n.",positive
"Daniel Craig is a great Bond! I was very skeptical about having a blonde haired Bond, but he really pulls it off good. Also great Bond movie, much better than any Peirce Brosman movie.",positive
"It is brilliant, slick and believable, at last! This opening to the Craig dynasty is for me as successful as the initial Dr. No",positive
movie seems too stretched ... though action is good .... but romance pulls the movie down... plain average,negative
"The first James Bond movie I watched, because of... Daniel Craig!",positive
"For me this is the be all and end all when it comes to Bond Films. Yeah it didn't have any gadgets but at last I felt that Bond had real character. A straight up flawed man, who happens to be a cold killer but yet somehow still has charm. That's what really surprised me about Craig. He has no problem with the emotions, and the cold killer stuff, for me he is the most believable bond yet, mind you he does have help from a killer script & yes, the director killed it with this one Martin Campbell is the man. The story in this takes so many turns and double takes its impressive that it keeps it all together and on top it gives us a love story that has all the highs and lows expected with the fragility experienced with falling in love. I love the way Bond was portrayed in this, an unstoppable force that has intelligence to work past his mistakes and covers his butt as he moves quickly and recklessly after the bad guy. Oh yeah, I also loved what they did with the relationship with Bond and M, Judi Dench killed it too, she was awesome.",positive
The best part about this movie was how quickly Daniel Craig managed to silence haters with his awesome portrayal of James Bond.,negative
The best one out there,positive
My favorite Bond movie to date.,positive
"Loved re-watching this, the dry humour daniel Craig has suits the modern bond and Eva Green has amazing eye makeup throughout the movie ;-)",positive
"This is a great movie by far the best Bond film ever made. Fantastic action sequences done very well, engaging story narrated almost flawless in my opinion. One of the new things here is you really care what happens to Bond and the others as well. Highly recommended this to anyone even if your not a fan of the other Bond films.",positive
Intense love poker and awesome Daniel Craig in my opinion best James Bond actor!,positive
"Haven't seen a bad a James Bond actor yet! Daniel Craig definitely pulls off the sexy, smooth, whitty, cool and loyal secret agent...besides my nephew's name is James Bond! :)",positive
3 words - Daniel Craig's Torso.....,positive
Best bond. Greene is wonderful. Craig plays it real.,positive
Left an openning for another movie!,positive
Bond.......James Bond,positive
After re-watching Casino Royale I have to uphold my statement that it is the best film in the Bond franchise. It goes beyond the scope of being an action movie by incorporating elements of suspense and romance. The acting is powerful and the tragedy with Vesper is as emotional if not more than M's tragedy in Skyfall. For the first time ever you witness James Bond's poker face fade both literally and figuratively. I applaud Campbell's direction in bringing Fleming's first Bond novel to life and Craig's ability to enthrall viewers through portraying Bond as someone that is actually human.,positive
one of the best movies,positive
"Casino Royale breathes new life into a series that was slowly falling into a downward spiral. With a compelling story and one of the most interesting Bond girls to date - Eva Green is fantastic in her role - Casino Royale is a tour de force from start to finish, and one of the best action movies of 2006.",positive
"A very neat plot with neat use of the 007 franchise - out of this world gadgets, guns, women and booze plus the alpha male look of Daniel Craig. A few surprises here and there, though a little bit predictable. Campbell played a few cards that will surely have your heart thumping with excellently choreographed action scenes.",positive
Casino Royale is easily the best James Bond film in years and my personal favourite.,positive
"Most likely the best Bond film since From Russia With Love. Gone are the gimmicks of the Brosnan era, returning 007 to his roots without forgetting who he is and where he came from. This is Bond at his best.",positive
Best Bond movie ever... Craig is great... storyline is deep yet simple and full of good ole Bond action... deal em I'm all in...,positive
"Guess I have to take a deep breath to describe what this movie tells by the awesome prodigies a human being like 007 british agent can reach through technology. Thus catching the bad guys' a matter of ""eating a piece of cake"".",negative
"""Casino Royale"" was a very good movie all in all and since a James Bond Movies is mostly about who plays as Agent 007,I gotta say Daniel Craig performed flawlessly as the coolest and most reckless James Bond ever!A short,blonde,colored-eye Man with everything a James Bond Character craves!",positive
Daniel Craig is one of the best Bond,positive
A much needed fresh breath to the franchise. Not that Brosnan was not good enough. But I'm glad the producers decided to break some cliches.,positive
Such a good bond movie. Lots of action and fantastic characters.,positive
great movie and greater book.,negative
The best Bond I have seen as of yet. (I've only seen 2),negative
Bond has been modernized and the result is an epic adventure full of twists and surprises. Craig makes a brilliant Bond.,positive
"Well with the 3rd 007 movie with Daniel Craig coming out soon I figured i should see the others. I have to admit that I lost interest in the Bond films a long time ago. I wasn't even really a fan of the classic ones either. So naturally I have been avoiding even these latest ones. I am glad I took a chance and watched this one because I see now that Martin Campbell has really created a good film with out all of the old 007 gimmicks I feel the previous movies felt obligated to follow. This is a great start to a new series and a fresh breath of air to the series. I am hooked. Outstanding performance by Daniel Craig, Eva Green and Mads Mikkelsen. The look and feel of this movie really kept my attention and was not sacrificed for the story telling. Looking forward to the next one",positive
"One of the best James Bond films (if not the best) since the beginning of Ian Flemming's 007. Daniel Craig brings back the old James Bond from the Sean Connery and Roger Moore years with effective style and mysterious grace. A phenomenal final act concludes Martin Campbell's Casino Royale starring Daniel Craig, Judi Dench, Eva Green and Mads Mikkelsen.",positive
Pretty good reboot of the Bond series.,negative
A classic bond film if not the best of the series longstanding saga.,positive
"It is different from the older 007 movies. This one is like a reborn. But I like quantum of solace just a bit more, maybe cause I seen quantum of solace first.",negative
"An exciting 007 adventure, this movie shows the more mature, gritty, dark, Bond. Where at times it can get pretty intense and graphic, it expresses a strong moral. It is not as rememberable as the classics, it is a great chapter in the James Bond legend.",negative
"You know the James Bond franchise has definitely been re-invented when our hero faces torture not by a slow moving laser beam, or a pool of sharks, but... fast, hard blows from a piece of rope to his testicles. Based on the first novel written by Ian Flemming about James Bond, this latest instalment in the longest running movie franchise ever, with a new hero in the form of one Daniel Craig, is a very successful and entertaining piece of cinema. Forget Pierce Brosnan, forget Timothy Dalton, and lets please forget about Roger Moore; this new Bond is the best since Connery, if not better in some ways. Our story begins at the beginning of Bonds career. He needs two kills to become a 00 agent and in a very film noir, black 'n' white style, we are exposed to that and the film kicks off from there. There are no fancy gadgets, no Q to dispense them, and no corny one liners. This is a totally new Bond, and the filmmakers have played a good move in this re- creation and in their casting of Daniel Craig. He brings a raw, edgy and ""human"" side to the character never seen before. He shows massive depth and range in his performance and we see what really lies behind the eyes of the character. He doesn't have the smoothness of Connery or the pretty boy looks of Brosnan - he's rugged, world weary and scarred and that is an example of what a real life secret agent might look like, and an element that makes Casino Royale so fresh and thrilling. In one scene Bond asks for his favourite drink, a Vodka Martini, and the barman asks him if he would like that shaken or stirred. Bonds answer ""Do I look like I give a dam?"" The story this time around focuses on your typical terrorist, specialising in laundering money and shady deals, but one who also has a knack for poker. This is where the second and middle act of the film kicks in. It spends a good amount of time at the Casino and on the game itself, which in previous Bond films may have been seen as a low, slow and boring point. But in today's world, where every man and his dog plays poker, it made for educational viewing. The actions scenes are first class and inspiring to watch. They are believable too and don't seem structured, rather coming together as if the characters are reacting to what's around them. This brings me back to the point of how the whole film has a very real substance to it. No implausible stunts or invisible cars. Just fair dinkum, honest to God action and violence. I loved this new film, and I loved the new Bond. Daniel Craig will take the new franchise into the 21st century and up to all new heights with no problems what so ever. Stick around for a while mate!",positive
"Just awesome, talk about breathing life back into Bond.",positive
yes yes yes its fukin wicked probs 1 ov the best bonds yet n da second best bond film yet,positive
A James Bond film that never shifts out of high gear.,positive
"From opening sequence to finale this Bond is the best. Real world stunts are by far incredible. Urban ""free running"" was the way to open this more ""realistic"" Bond ""first"" film. And of course the world record setting rolls of the Bond classic car was yet another of the real world stunts. Like the old Bonds? Try this one out. What the Bond character was meant to be! An interesting touch was the switch from B&W to color when Bond qualifies for double O status (AKA Wizard of Oz moment) My only issue is with the time line blendings, but who cares, this was the best Bond film, IMHO",positive
This one gets fours stars!,positive
"One of the very few movies I saw in the theaters more than once, and on purpose.",positive
A necessary turn for Bond films. It is certainly a treat with wonderful action sequences and well paced scenes as well as a good score. Its one of the better action films of the decade.,positive
Best bond movie yet...,positive
fantastic!!! best bond film thus far !!!,positive
"most definitely the best bond movie i have ever seen. Talk about the thrills, chills, action that can drive u to the edge of your seat or vulnerability, haven't seen a bond film that can match this one's standard in terms of pace, intrigue, style or cheekiness. Well done Martin Campbell. Bond at his best.",positive
"A great reboot, with an excellent performance from Craig",positive
Finally ! Sorry but brosnan had to stop before he killed the whole serie. Craig really is fleming's Bond. This movie left me speechless.,positive
"Holy crap this movie's awesome. Bond gets worked big time and we see why he never allows women to get too close. Awesome action, great story, and they play poker too! Sweet!!",positive
"Salir de acción intensa para caer en escenas lentas es un tanto brusco y creo que en parte es lo que hace que la película falle, pero Casino Royale se sustenta por si sola como una interesante, bien escrita, fuerte y emocional película de espionaje. Pues no solo depende de las escenas de acción, sino que además podemos apreciar el lado humano de Bond.",positive
"Casino Royale is a thrilling and welcome reboot to a series that's been around for almost 50 years, and a terrific addition to the Bond catalogue. There's no question that Craig has the chops to play Bond; the looks, the stunts, the quips, the charm...it's all here. Bond is actually portrayed as a human being struggling with some issues, instead of a ""superhero with gadgets"" that some people have come to see the character as in recent movies. His performance is top notch and here's to hoping he'll continue to play the character in future installments.",positive
He is the NEW bond I predict he might even relace Connery as the best bond!,positive
"best james bond yet. he doesn't have invisible cars, watches that shoot lasers, or any other rediculous gadgets.",positive
"should not have the name james bond in it because it is unlike any other. but if it didnt this movie would get 5 stars, overall... best one yet.",positive
One of the best Bond movies ever made. I read the novel and the movie and both blew my mind. It presents Bond as a human being capable of failure rather than that smug face which had gotten too boring.,positive
Daniel Craig did a damn good job on this one!!!,positive
"This is among the best bond movies! even storyline of quantum solace will not beat that.This movie is pack of nice view location, love scene, great action.Daniel Craig is superb as James Bond and parting from that point everything in it is enjoyable, frightening, thrilling just because we're with him.After all the controversy and comments on Daniel Craig's potential as an actor and doubts over him playing Bond...i'd say forget it and be enthralled by the new BOND! He's here to stay.The film is class, from the cinematography, to the three dimensional villains, and Bond's rapid learning curve.Also Eva Green is so hot in this movie and not to mention I love the scene of great playing poker.",positive
could of been gooder.,negative
Best Bond film in my opinion. N that's saying something compared to ALL other older classics.,positive
"""Casino Royale"" is one of the best entries into the Bond series not just because the action is good, or because of the fantastic stunt work and ridiculous plot, but also because it allows us to see an aspect of the Bond character that had never really been explored before. Daniel Craig as 007 himself is a great presence on the screen and, like a good action movie should, the film keeps the thrills going at a great pace, allowing for rest, and having character development to make their efforts more meaningful so that we become more invested. This ranks up with ""Die Hard"" as one of the best action films I have seen in quite awhile.",positive
"a different type of bond, more intense. Great action!",positive
Among the best of 007's adventures. See what happens when you stay close to the books?,positive
"i'm not sure if it really felt like a james bond movie, but it was good nonetheless.",positive
"Sean Connery, to date the best James Bond there is. That being said, Daniel Craig is James Bond, but not the super hero never gets hurt James Bond, this is the human, fallible, James Bond. Oh yeah and he also kicks some serious ass in this movie. I was unsure I would like him as Bond, but he proved me wrong. Add Judi Dench to the mix and you have a great James Bond film. One of many I hope.",positive
"i truly loved this movie , best bond movie ever, i actually understood it ;-) , + its funny",negative
Best Bond Movie Ever,positive
eva green was rel hott,positive
The best and most down to earth Bond film of all time.,positive
"Hands-down the best Bond movie ever. The story of how 007 became 007. In my personal opinion Daniel Craig is the best James Bond of all time. He brings a realism to the character that never existed before. You can really identify with him as an ordinary man with an extraordinary job. Not to mention that Bond is just a badass in this movie. He's ruthless in his pursuit of the cause, not letting anything get in his way. Eva Green is... well, Eva Green. She excels at being a match for Bond in every way. Smart, sexy, and charming, she definitely holds her own as one of the top Bond girls. There's much more action than in some of the previous Bond films, and it's alot more gritty and realistic. It's alot more than just gun battles with a huge number of badguys with fully automatics that can't aim. There's alot more up-close, in-your-face action scenes. I just think this movie shines where the last 3 films have failed. And let's just face it, Daniel Craig can kick Pierce Brosnan's ass anyday.",positive
"Bond re-invented. Best Bond movie in a VERY long time. Daniel Craig made me nervous, but he really owns the role. Can't wait till the next one!",positive
The best movie ever made. This is my all-time favorite movie.,positive
"Craig give Connery a run for his money as the best James Bond, o and it's his first go around.. Nothing but a bright future for James Bond lovers like myself.",positive
too many violence... lol sike,negative
Amazing. Craig made a fantastic Bond. The first one in a while to have a good blend of plot and action. Can't wait to see the sequel.,positive
Daniel Craig turns James Bond into what he always had the potential to be...,positive
"This movie was awesome and well written. Introducing Daniel Craig as James Bond, this film takes us back and shows how Bond became 007 status. That is very interesting to see. The action and story are great, and Craig made a good Bond. I thought the end of the movie was really cool, however this is the first Bond film that doesn't have the classic lines from every other Bond film (shaken not stirred & Bond Jame Bond), doesn't have the dots across the screen at beginning or end and doesn't play the Bond theme until the end of the movie. That doesn't bother me so much nut I think they should have kept it in because it is classic James Bond.",positive
Not much to say except an exceptional nearly flawless movie and the best James Bond Movie ever made. Daniel Craig is by far the best James Bond and there is no comparison.,positive
i was like totally out of it during most of this cuz i was exhausted at coles house...but it was alright...,negative
"Stylish, action packed, superbly acted, and a solid script and plot make this not only (one) of the best Bond films, but a great film period.",positive
kick ass action. i came out of the theater wanting to be a secret agent.,positive
Best Bond movie....... EVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!,positive
Possibly the very best James Bond movie of all time!,positive
"The best James Bond film hands down. It succeeds in practically every way that the others didn't. It has a classy, realistic, and relate-able character that doesn't get too caught up in the moment.",positive
Daniel Craig is 007 he is going to do a good job really want to see the next film now,positive
"Casino Royale est un film intelligent qui, lors de maintes scènes, se passe d'explosions pour exprimer son propos. Largement fidèle au roman du même nom de Ian Fleming, James Bond fait un retour sur le sentier de la conformité et, enfin, les scripteurs se plient à la loquacité ingénieuse de Fleming pour pondre un scénario digne de son nom. Surprenament, Daniel Craig se démarque de la majorité des autres James Bond en ce sens où il est l'un des seuls dont le talent d'acteur soit rudement mis à l'épreuve par plusieurs scènes où il frise l'échec et le percute même de plein fouet à certains moments, ce que peu de James Bond ont eu l'occasion de faire depuis le tout début de la série. Ce qui me grise un peu toutefois, c'est ce fameux phénomène typique du cinéma d'aujourd'hui, soit celui de ne jamais vouloir clore la boucle d'un ''blockbuster'', de toujours laisser une porte entrouverte pour prévoir une suite. Au lieu de faire de Casino Royale un épisode de la vie de Bond, on en a fait une prémisse à Quantum of Solace, misant sur cet effet de ''suite'' pour maximiser les revenus au box-office de ce prochain volet qui sera bientôt sur nos écrans.",positive
"good, one of the few Bond movies Ive seen, enjoyed it",positive
Great movie. I just rewatched it in preparation for the sequel. This Bond is really a cross between Sean Connery and Matt Damon in the Bourne series. Awesome!,positive
"The best James Bond movie I've ever seen,... and the only James Bond movie I've ever seen.",positive
"An amazing movie, combines all of the good bond attributes and combine them into one movie.",positive
Great James Bond movie! Daniel Craig is great in the first of his 007 installment!,positive
Essentially; Bond Man Begins and that's not a bad thing. Bond needed to hold down on the reset button and never let go after Die Another Day. I love this film's grit and energy and its uncanny ability to make poker as exciting as a chase through a construction site.,positive
"This had the most action out of all the Bond movies. PERFECT action. A perfect start for Daniel Craig, a great movie.",positive
best bond film yet in my opinion...,positive
Daniel Craig revitalizes the Bond franchise the same way Bale saved Batman. This was a throwback to the good ol days of Connery Bond.,positive
"This is my first Bond movie. I know some iconic lines and scenes from some of the classic Bond films, but otherwise, I have very little knowledge about the Bond franchise. I went into this movie with very high expectations, and I was somewhat disappointed. Casino Royale is really good; the acting is solid, Eva Green and Daniel Craig have amazing chemistry, the casino scenes are intense, and Bond is able to be serious yet charismatic. The problem is that a lot of the movie is just forgettable. The plot is forgettable, all of the antagonists are forgettable, almost the entire first hour and a half or so are forgettable, and excluding the final action sequence, the action is forgettable. There is also a quick transition from an action movie to a romance within the course of a few minutes, and though Green and Craig are a pleasure to watch together, the abrupt change of pace is still surprising and odd. Luckily, the good outweighs the bad, but not enough to excuse the mediocrity of much of the film; Casino Royale is only an 8/10. It's really good, but not the involving, unforgettable, action masterpiece that I expected after hearing about how great it was for almost 6 years.",positive
"A fresh take on an old franchise, this movie raises the bar for all future bond films and sets a new standard for all spy flicks.",positive
"This movie is really good. Daniel Craig makes a fantastic Bond in a movie that doesn't need full on action to entertain. I think the best parts of the movie are the poker scenes. The story was very good and the villain was pretty cool, except he didn't really have much of a scheme from what I could see and wasn't very complex. This movie is great.",positive
"The quintessential man - every woman wants him, every man wants to be him. Sounds like the Dos Equis guy right? Nope, it's Bond, James Bond. Oh yeah, my review - well what more can I say? It's James Bond we're talkin about here. We get to see where his passion for fast cars & even faster women came from... & yes, even a bit of a human side as well. We get to see what fuels his anger. Not to mention the stunts are well done & Bond's innuendos & one-liners are top notch, it makes the movie flow. & of course you also got the villain that weeps blood. What more could you ask for? All in all, a very nice reboot to the franchise :-)",positive
i am not a 007 fan but this one was not bad,positive
I haven't seen a good Bond flick in ages! I really like this guy!,negative
"After re watching this i can safely say that this movie is my favorite james bond movie of all time. Daniel craig is brilliant as bond having a share of serious scenario's and loads of charming and funny ones too. From the very impressive first chase of the movie till the end this movie never stopped impressing. Good villian, slick action, a very good plot that filled in many unexplained gaps of the old movies and the movie is just badass.",positive
"Now this is what im talking about. A Bond movie with a good story and very fun action. The first half hour or so was very fun, filled with cool chases and shootouts. But later in the movie I thought it took a little dip when they spent a little too much time at the casino. But its made up for its fun and cool twist at the end. Daniel Craig is an awesome James Bond as well as the rest of the cast. I also liked Le Chiffre. He was a really fun bad guy. Overall this was much better than that hunk of garbage known as Skyfail and next im definitly watching Quantom of Solace. 8/10",positive
Daniel Craig is excellent as Bond,positive
possibly the best Bond ever... definitely one of the best chase scenes ever.,positive
A great fun action movie that will please die hard James Bond fans and even those who aren't familiar with the legendary action hero.,positive
"With an amazing script that delves deep into Bond's humanity, Casino Royale is a fantastically beautiful film with a stunning performance from Daniel Craig.",positive
"Can very well be considered the best Bond movie thus far, and is definitely comparable to the early Bond. Daniel Craig is a natural! 5-Stars!!!",positive
One of the best man movies of all time!,positive
Now this is how to make a James Bond film.,positive
posibly best bond movie made.,positive
"this movie made me a daniel craig fan and a james bond fan, could watch it a lot and not get borded. i absalutly love the opening song.",positive
"The Best Bond I've seen in years, the best Bond Movie I've seen EVER.",positive
"Strongest of the Bond films I have seen. The brooding Bond makes for a more compelling character, and the darker ""reboot"" works here.",positive
I like the humour they have kept in it as well as some awesome action.,negative
Best Bond since Goldfinger...actually...it's the best Bond movie yet,positive
Perfection. Craig is the best Bond ever. Watch!,positive
excelent movie Daniel Craig ..the best JB of our time.,positive
This is by far the best Bond film and Daniel Craig is by far the best Bond!! My only complaint - where the freak was Q?,positive
I thought Daniel Craig was fantastic as James Bond! I loved this movie. It has re-energized the whole franchise. Great story!,positive
"Very different from the original bond series, by focusing more on Bond as a physical man rather than relying heavily on fancy non-existent gadgets.",positive
"Surprisingly complex entry into the Bond series, and we're not necessarily talking about the plot as much as the characters.",positive
Injects a new lease of life into the bond franchise. The new gritty and real bond and outstanding cast (especially Eva Green) makes james bond cool again after last silly and gadget crazy film. The James Bond franchise just of its license to kill back,positive
Paisa wasool movie... can watch it over and over again,positive
"Very violent and dark, but it's excellent. Craig is the best bond since Connery, I'm looking forward to the next in his line of 007 movies.",positive
"seen it already, good movie",negative
Brutal scenes! True James Bond stuff,positive
At last a cold bond. Very good film apart from it was just a little bit too long !,negative
"As far as Bond movies, the best with Goldeneye.",negative
best bond in my opinion.,positive
better than I expected,negative
Is impressive. It is invigorating. Is smooth. fresh. James Bond!,negative
I was never a bond guy before. I look forward to the next one.,positive
"Good Bond flick, Daniel Craig makes a much tougher bond than Pierce Brosnan.",positive
"This. Movie. Is. Awesome!! All of my fears about Craig and the revamp have been totally erased. Killer story, great acting, pretty great ending. Even the fat obnoxious couple and their two kids behind us couldn't ruin it.",positive
"Manages to beat two full houses and a lesser straight flush, and then gets hit in the nuts over and over. Man, I hate it when that happens.",positive
"Tensely plotted, well acted, and suspenseful, Casino Royale removes the Mission Impossible tech and cheesy dialogue and goes in as a balls-to-the-wall Bourne-like action thriller",positive
The best Bond flick ever! Craig is the most realistic and entertaining Bond yet.,positive
The Best bond film i have seen!,positive
"It is great to see the action genre show its star's humanity. The first in the latest Bond reboot is so well executed that it stands apart from it's predecessors, ushering in a new era, and idea, of Bond.",positive
"Probably we've never seen a James Bond movie like this one. The new ways of this new Bond seems to agree with what the audience was asking for, but how good is this movie actually? In my opinion, the film is less comercial than the latest James Bonds, and the story has its wise moves. But despite all that, the film is boring most of the time and I really disagree about Daniel Craig's good performances. He is not the right one for this character, James Bond deserves a better actor.",negative
"One of the greatest Bond films of all time. No one can touch Connery, but I believe Daniel Craig was the closest to match Connery's level since Roger Moore.",positive
Best Bond movie ever!!!,positive
The new james bond is a real action hero,positive
i absolutly luved it. and daniel craig - so so hot!,positive
"Best bond so far in my opinion, they took a step to the left of a step to the right *im not quite sure* from the old films, different face on the ""bond girl"" and no silly gagets that seem to tie perfectly in with the script. Just inteligent action, bond style but as i said, a step in a different direction for sure. I def. hope to see more~ INK Black.",positive
James Bond finally gets the gritty reboot.,positive
All i can say is that its a good movie,positive
"The best bond since GoldenEye. Definitely in my top 5 favorite bonds. Craig did a fantastic job at making the new bond more of a badass, while still remaining somewhat suave. Plot was somewhat simple, but overall extremely entertaining.",positive
"It starts off with a mind-blowing and death-defying (literally, for those incredible stuntmen) foot chase, and never lets up. The climactic poker game is as thrilling as any chase, and the whole thing ends with a satisfying bang. This ain't your parent's Bond.",positive
The best Bond flick yet.........they could not have chosen a better actor to play the part.,positive
"Campbell avait deja ressuciter James Bond avec Pierce Brosnan dans Goldeneye. Il recidive avec Daniel Craig dans Casino Royale. Deux films, deux chefs d'oeuvres.",positive
Rightfully named to be the best James Bond Film next to casino royale,positive
"this new james bond is so weird looking, like a bushbaby thing",negative
Craig defies everyone's cynicism and Bond is back to being beautiful.,positive
Absolutely great bond movie. I hated the idea of Daniel Craig being the new Bond but after seeing him in action...hell yeah this was a great movie. I look forward to more of his Bond movies. Action was intense...loved it.,positive
"James Bond is a horn dog and needs to keep his junk in his pants. Also Daniel Craig needs to stop puckering his lips, he is not that good looking.",negative
"A darker Bond, this is boasted with amazing action sequences, gorgeous locations, and a more cynical Bond by Daniel Craig. This film provides thrills on all levels, even as something as slow as a poker game is presented in a well and thrilling manner!",positive
"It was worth it just to watch the new bond, espcially when he came out of the water.lol",positive
"Fast paced, gripping, and undeniably smart, Casino is an incredible pick up of 007.",positive
This is the best James Bond film ever made. Period. I was blown away.,positive
"Love it, Daniel Craig is a kickass Bond",positive
Didn't think I would dig Daniel Craig. I was wrong and I was delighted TO BE WRONG. Best BOND script in years. Griity action. Fun film,negative
Bond just not the same without all of his cool gadgets.,negative
It could be better. His insanity was incredible.,negative
"daniel craig, the best bond actor. he played well and emotionally",positive
"A compelling cinematic tour de force that is immediately gripping and in turn cool, exhilarating, funny and tear-jerking. Like the best reboots Casino Royale distils what is great and timeless about a beloved character while throwing out what is archaic or unnecessary, resulting in a believable reimagining with no small part of the success coming from an outstanding performance from Craig. He nails the balance needed for Bond; someone the audience really shouldn't like and yet a man we completely root for. Through him and a wealth of other great preformances the film is able to pull off a deeper exploration of the character than ever before. And so we get to see the weaknesses of a man like Bond as well as the strength needed to be the best of the best. Among the film's other delights are the most tense card game on celluloid, perfect matches for our hero in both an extremely sinister villain and perfect Bond girl chemistry, and one of the greatest closing lines in film history.",positive
"i love bond but, but it could of been better.",positive
"The best Bond movie yet. Even though, the rest weren't that great. Daniel Craig is wonderful, and is very surprising as this is the first time I've seen him. Very necessarily dramatic (unlike it's sequel). Everything about this movie works, including the poker, the romance, and the action.",positive
This was a very good one Bond wins again.,positive
jamesbound is the best spy,positive
"Finally, the James Bond series has replaced the bad jokes, pick-up lines, and gadgets for a real, gritty feel. Daniel Craig breathes fresh air into the stale franchise adding a necessary human element. Casino Royale is a fantastic film from start to finish. Craig and Green's chemistry is off the charts.",positive
One of the best bonds yet,positive
One of the best Bond movies,positive
Great reboot of a classic series!,positive
Daniel Craig...what's not to love?!? HOTNESS!!!,positive
"Casino Royale, es una historia de espionaje con emociones, una historia en la cual no se necesita accion para mantenerte al borde del asiento, contando con un misterio que de por si es espectacular, pero que falla al momento de pasar de escenas de accion al desarrollo de la trama lo cual hace que la pelicula se torne un poco lenta.",positive
What a FANTASTIC 007! Daniel Craig did a fantastic job!,positive
ugggggggh booooooooooring fell asleep in the theatre,negative
Will not say its the best. But its one of them.,positive
"finally, they went back to the books for this one. taking on the first 007 book, daniel craig brings a new chemistry to the bond franchise, and is much needed! he pulls of a whole new kind of bond and puts everyone, except sean connery, to shame. great movie with a whole new take on bond: believable, personal, and still packed with action.",positive
Your not my type. what? smart? no...Single.,positive
Craig is an excellent Bond imo. Fits the grittiness they were going for in this movie.,positive
"Easily the best Bond film made. The whole opening is great and when they get into the chase scene, that is how an action movie chase scene is meant to be done. The action is well timed, placed and is blended so well with a clever script that carries many good subplots into the next creating a masterful main plot that also keeps throwing little curve balls into the story just when you think you are figuring it out. Craig is the perfect Bond, and carries the right serious tone along with a blend of humor that is dry and witty which brings the classic Bond quips some relative humor. The movie carried the perfect serious tone that even the card game was exciting, and I think it is too hard to find a problem with this film as it is damn near perfect to the 007 name especially considering and comparing the recent 20 films.",positive
"I'm probably alone on this one but for me this movie was disappointing and so totally Overrated. The plot makes no sense, it's too long for the ""story"" it wants to tell and that end it's one of the worst i've seen in a while! Very poor dialogue too... A Bond movie with no soul.",negative
Daniel Craig was a good 007.,positive
"A GREAT bond movie! Absolutely loved it, action packed yet not over the top. I especially love the poker scenes, great acting!",positive
gave me faith in Bond films again. I loved this film for so many reasons. The first chase scene was amazing and the love story was one to top. The scene where he washes the blood off her hands...very well done.,positive
Dare I say...best Bond movie ever. The perfect action movie.,positive
"Casino Royale is a great action movie, but it rises above because of Daniel Craig's fresh portrait of Bond, as well as a good script.",positive
Badass Bond. Best I have seen since GoldenEye,positive
"Daniel Craig shows us he is the best Bond. He played the role so great. The action was spectacular, Madagascar scene in particular. Eva Green is the Bond girl, Vesper and is an eye pleaser. 4.5/5",positive
"It has plenty of more depth and entertainment than the Bronsan ones, but Craig should have been a little more of a professional agent.",positive
Probably the best Bond movie I've ever seen. Daniel Craig could kick Pierce Brosnan's ass.,positive
"The biguining of the movie was great, but the rest was crap!!!!! Daniel Craig is a great choice to be the next Bond, but like I said, the story was slow for me.",negative
The best Bond film in recent memory,positive
"This reboot of the legendary franchise (If you dare call it that), is one of the best 007 films in ages, with an intriguing (and sorta realistic) plot, great direction from Martin Campbell (who previously directed one of my favorite 007 films, GoldenEye), terrific acting fron Daniel Craig, interesting scrernplay, and well done action sequences, pulled off flawlessly. Overall, this is a great Bond film to watch, and is a unaminous must-see, Bond fan or not.",positive
"Wasn't into it the first time I saw it, but enjoyed it the second.",negative
"This is probably the pinnacle of the Bond franchise. It has all the great elements you want in a Bond film, except maybe some gadgets ;) To bad QOS was such a miss step, it had the possibility of being great. Looking forward to Skyfall, hopefully it will be much better.",positive
Excellent acting by Daniel Craig. I was worried at first but now I'm comfortable saying that he may be better than Brosnan and can catch up with Connery.,positive
daniel craig is an amazing OO7 great movie not as actiony as i wanted it 2 be but still awesome,positive
"Holy shit Daniel Craig is one bad-ass mother-fucker who puts Pierce Brosnan to shame. Without a doubt the absolute best in the entire Bond series all the way from the 60s to the current flim, and maybe to partially due to just modern day film making, but it really is Daniel Craig who makes it.",positive
"This movie was slow paced, boring at times, poor dialog, very weak female actresses (and not very attractive) with a weak plot and a very weak villain, but it had decent action and and was entertaining.",negative
the other dude wuz better,negative
"A total surprise! Not only is this a great Bond movie, it may very weel be the best Bond movie. Truly, a great film!",positive
Daniel Craig brings out the darkside of 007. Great Movie!,positive
I hated James Bond. This movie made me change my mind. You don't need a super-violent movie to make a great action movie. Plenty of witty dialogue between Craig and Green. Not to mention he makes a fantastic Bond.,positive
"""The names Bond, James Bond."" I have not seen any Bond movies except bits and pieces of GoldenEye which I thought was all right. So I have heard nothing but great things about this movie and how it's the best Bond yet. I'm really happy to say that Casino Royale is an excellent action movie and one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm going to start off by saying that the action in this movie was awesome! The action in this film was shot very well and it was entertaining and sometimes jawdropping. The fight scenes were great. Also the chase scenes were exhilarating and fun! I also loved how the opening scene in this movie is shot in black and white. The poker scenes in this film are so suspenseful and I was on the edge of my seat! There is also a plot twist in this movie that I never saw coming! What I suprised by in this movie was that the script was well written and some of the dialogue was actually funny. Not only that but some of the things that Bond does in this is movie is really funny. As far as acting goes everyone was great and I LOVED Daniel Craig in this movie and this is honestly the best I have seen him. Overall I loved Casino Royale and now I am kind of interested in other James Bond films.",positive
"Despite the fact that it has a lot of good things going for it, Casino Royale unfortunately comes up short as a Bond film with a terribly miscast leading man and some downright silly attempts at gritty realism; ultimately, the film seems like a dire cash-in on the Bourne films and Batman Begins, much in the same way as Moonraker cashed in on Star Wars.",negative
My favorite Bond -- no contest.,positive
Daniel Craig kicks the other Bonds' ass.,positive
"Great action and of course, Daniel Craig. Too long for its own good.",negative
Daniel Craig did awesome in this movie.,positive
"Dark, compelling, and as well-acted as spy movie you'll see, 'Casino Royale' not only subverted some of the clichés to which Bond audiences had grown accustomed, but it ushered in a new era for the British superspy.",positive
The new bond is the best bond.,positive
"everything Bond should be: tightly-paced action, smart dialog, and even a moving plot; if you want your entertainment to make you actually feel something, this film is absolutely essential (4.75/5)",positive
"The best James Bond movie of my generation. I think that's prett certain. I haven't seen ""Golden Eye"" recently so I don't really know.",positive
"In my opinion this is the best James Bond film. I love how they step out of the box, of not doing the same old James Bond routine and made this one intense and gritty.it's truly a film on its own. You wouldn't even know that this is a James Bond movie. A really great movie.",positive
The best Bond Ever!!!,positive
"it was alright. great action, but too much talking and drama.",positive
"Craig is the perfect successor to Connery, and together they make the perfect Bond, complete.",positive
"Best Bond movie ever!!! I loved everymin. of this movie!!! Daniel Craig definatly improved the movie, but t was good already!! So that tells you something!",positive
"Arguably one of the Best bond movies ever made. Daniel Craig makes James Bond, our beloved 007 agent, a humane, vulnerable, and compelling character that we actually care about. When he gets hurt, you feel the pain. The set-pieces are exciting and gripping to watch, and Martin Campbell does a great job handling the action and drama. My only complaint about the film is the love story that happens at the last 20 minutes of the film, but that is a very small complaint because the rest of the film is just terrific and so fun to watch. Casino Royale is a non-stop roller coaster ride.",positive
AWESOME James Bond! Sooo refreshing!!,positive
"casino royale is smart and highly entertaining, and it introduces a darker take on 007, without being completely humorless.",positive
good reboot to the bond films. They were getting very rediculous and rebooting them was the best thing to do. I just hope we get to see Q and Moneypenny in the one after Quantum of Solace,positive
This Bond will blow you away!,positive
I love Daniel Craig.,positive
Daniel Craig is an amazing James Bond! This movie was the best James Bond movie ever. Better than the classics..,positive
This movie has all the Bond formula elements and a return to the original Bond character based on an assassin for MI-5. Lots of action except for the long card game.,positive
This is what action films should aspire to be.,positive
couldn't finish it. craig just isn't james bond.,negative
I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. THERE WAS PLENTY OF ACTION.,positive
"Craig begins his Bond career with a bang! Great action, great bond girls and an amazing story!",positive
"Bond was originally an assasin, and daniel craig pust the badass back in bond. no question about it. Craig has finally given the enemies a man to fear. what a kick ass movie",positive
Best Bond film of the past 20 years!!!,positive
best bond film with the second best bond behind the great sean connery,positive
James is alive again,positive
007 has a darker and more serious however loses some of the elegance Spy,positive
A great film that goes a little too long,positive
only James Bond movie I've seen as it's awesome!,positive
A great re-boot of the Bond series. The best Bond movie in a long time.,positive
this movie is very good,positive
I like this movie is was ok,positive
"good movie, but what the hell happened to all the gadgets? if i am not mistaken, that was what made 007 so popular. right or wrong?",positive
"I'm not a fan of James Bond's movies, but my husband loves them. I saw and it was good.",negative
must see!! the best bond flick ever.,positive
This movie was all right- Not enough action- Lots of twists- you have to watch carefully.,negative
Definitely the most un-Bond movie to date.,positive
A perfect blend of action and story.,positive
It's a shame this turned into Quantum.,positive
"You have to take a double take when you look at the poster. Is this really Sean Connery or are my eyes playing tricks on me? Well, yes and no. James Bond is back and it is like the whole Roger Moore Years hadn't even happened. THis is the real James Bond. A James BOnd that is more direct from Flemings original page than a suave cocktail host who carries a gun. You are mesmorized by how Bond Copes with killing people for his first, second, and third time in this story and how he deals with the double cross. Just an amazing film.",positive
This movie made me a James Bond Fan.,positive
La mejor bond movie ever!!!!!!!!,positive
Much better than I thought it was gonna be. Watched it for my husband but. Hey Daniel Craig naked....hehe wasnt soo bad. lol,negative
"I was pleasantly surprised by this most recent Bond endeavor. I didn't have great hopes for it. While it was probably about 20 minutes too long, it had a lot going for it and I was very impressed by Daniel Craig's take on Bond.",positive
this pic was great! love it!,positive
"Easily my favorite Bond thanks to 3 things. 1. Realistic action is soooo much better then stupidity any day. 2. Fantastic script. one of the best bond stories I have ever heard. 3. Daniel Craig, I would fuck em. I'm not gay but have you seen this guy, I would fuck the living daylights (pun!!!!!) out of him.",positive
"One of my all time favorites, this movie is extremely entertaining. Daniel Craig gives a flawless performance. It has a stunning cast, amazing action, and a great script. Oh and it also has the very beautiful Eva Green",positive
Craig is very good as Bond.,negative
Easily a top 5 Bond movie. Easily.,positive
"Move over Pierce Brosnan. Say hello to an edgier and more gutsy Bond in Daniel Craig. He injects much needed life into the Bond franchise. Keep in mind that i'm not a Bond fan to begin with,but i thought this was done quite well.",negative
One of the best action/suspense movies I've ever seen,positive
"I'm not much of a bond fan, but this one was pretty excellent. Not perfect, but very enjoyable.",positive
I think that Bond was captured well here. It's all before the non-chalant killer doing his job. He was so human and when the movie was over...we see the James we all know developing. I thought it was great!,positive
"Not entirely sure about Daniel Craig, but it was an awesome movie.",positive
"Daniel Craig reignites the James Bond franchise in Casino Royale, one of my favorites in the long-running series. This film is grittier, more emotional than perhaps any before it, and I believe, the best since the first three in the early 1960s. The gadgets are always fun but no substitute for brawny action, and Craig delivers it. He's a physical action star as well as a skillful, versatile actor. This Bond seems extremely macho yet is vulnerable to feminine counterpart, Vesper Lynd. All of the actors playing Bond in the long running series have been able to pull of suave but not necessarily tough. Connery, of course set the standard, and I think George Lazenby could have continued it too. Craig is almost sadistically tough in this role. This guy doesn't give a damn if its shaken or stirred. All the cast contributed in this new-look film. Eva Green as Vesper was a cool, effective Bond-girl, atypical. Judi Dench as M is a likewise genius move; things have definitely been shaken up. LeChiffre, the criminal mastermind, is sufficiently creepy. The bleeding eye is a great touch. I didn't really like or buy into Giancarlo Giannini as Mathis; I didn't like him in Hannibal either. Also, my only real complaint is that at 144 minutes, it could have been cut to speed it up some. This film accomplished a rare feat; it presents a different side of James Bond and a return to his roots at the same time.",positive
best bond movie ever,positive
"Daniel Craig is a good James Bond replace,emrnt",positive
"Daniel Craig really shows what he's made of as the new James Bond in Casino Royale. It's a clever, intense, and hard hitting movie that sends you on a trip through the life of 007. What I like the most about this movie the most is that they made James Bond a more believable person; they brought him back down to earth as this guy who can take a punch but punch you back even harder.",positive
"The strongest entry in the 007 series since Roger Dalton was Bond, Casino Royale and makes James Bond serious once again. Daniel Craig is as mesmerizing as can be, and together with an incredibly well put together script, Casino Royale takes the cake as one of the best movies of its year.",positive
Amazing opening sequence. See it on imax and be prepared to be blown away.,positive
"Upon re-watch, it is a pretty cool film. Craig's Bond is a bit rougher than his predecessors, which at first made me think ""well, this isn't Bond"", but since this is a reboot of sorts it makes sense that we see how he ""becomes"" the 007 we all know and love. There're nice action aequences and the plot could have been made into three films. Though it has a rather bland set of bad guys.",positive
"You get to see the dark side of Bond, how it all started and the main reason that he never recorved emotionally.",positive
"Simply put, this is the best actor to play bond. And this may be the best bond...no matter what everyone says, Daniel Craig pulls it off wonderfully",positive
never before have i seen an actor clean up a mess soo well. long live daniel craig,positive
The best Bond movie since A View To A Kill although not as much action as Goldeneye. Can't waith for his next movie!,positive
"Daniel craig plays the perfect 007 agent suspenseful action thrill ride with a high achieving film. The best in the Bond series the action was great, the cast was great and Daniel Craig is the Perfect James Bond.",positive
He's no Sean Connery but still a good movie.,negative
"An awesome reinvention. Daniel Craig makes a compelling case for the best Bond, period.",positive
"A much-needed reboot for the Bond series was delivered in spades with this effort. Craig settles nicely into the role, and the modern edge given to the character and situations is well received.",negative
really good the best one,positive
"Stunning. I wasn't crazy about it the first time I watched it, but it grew on me. It has an insane amount of whit and charm, with intelligent action- something rare to spy movies, including the recent entries in the franchise.",positive
Daniel Craig is awesome as 007. Action scenes are good too... Must watch movie...,positive
"Casino Royale has brilliant action scenes, emotional moments and an excellent storyline, all thanks to the collaboration between director Martin Campbell and Daniel Craig. This might be the best Bond film yet.",positive
The jumping kid is amazing =),negative
Amazing. The best Bond film of them all. It feels unusually real and relatable while still being James Bond. The highest quality in every department.,positive
"This movie is way better then the old James Bond movies! I luv watching it over and over! The new James Bond (Daniel Craig) is totally awesome and one of thoese kinds of hunk, you luv watching over and over! BRAVO, BRAVO, THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!",positive
"this one was okay, i did not like daneil craig as bond at all, i perfer sean connery by a landslide, or at least pierce bronzan. i thought it was nothing but just poker whitch was wayyyyy to predictible and stupid and silly. if they made it mroe interesting it wouldve been better. the ending i did not like. the begginning was interesting, the middle was okay",negative
The best Bond movie I've seen. Daniel Craig is better than Pierce Brosnan ever was.,negative
definetly not the best film in my opinion but it's in the top 10 and definetly a great film returning us to the days of connery and lazenby (he was ok) though i did miss moneypenny and the gunbarrel was creative,positive
"By far, the best James Bond movie there is!",positive
A brilliant rebirth to the Bond series that is in many ways nothing like the Bond series. Bond becomes a much more round character that is portrayed exceptionally by Daniel Craig. My favourite James Bond film!,positive
"The action sequences are phenomenal as with any Bond movie. It's weird seeing James fall in love, but cool at the same time. Unfortunately there was slow pacing at points, but hey, Daniel Craig did a great job!",negative
An exciting movie that's surprisingly deep and smart. A great return for Bond.,positive
This effectively re-spawned my interest in the franchise!! I need to check out the other Bond's not including Brosnan as Ive seen those.,positive
"Hands down, one of the best Bond movies since Goldfinger.",positive
I am glad too see Bond back and with great style with action.Helps me forget the Moore years,positive
"Possible the best Bond film, mostly due to the smart storytelling and Daniel Craig's pitch perfect 007.",positive
"By far my favorite Bond film, and I don't even think of it as a Bond movie. I just think of it as a great action movie.",positive
One of the best Bond films ever.,positive
One of the best Bond films ever.,positive
"Casino Royale is silent, smart and attractive. Craig's charisma gives Bond a new look with its serious but gorgeous Bond. The film is genius and action packed thinking this is maybe the Bond that everybody was satisfied and been waited for decades for its new restoration. A top on its list.",positive
"In this remake of 007, Casino Royale finally deliver us a solid James Bond flick, unlike the original this one is by far the best out of it's predecessors. Daniel Craig looking handsome as always, and his performance was just unforgettably solid. This intense 007 remake offers us good action sequence, solid story and script. Good dialogue and the CGI was just breathtaking. Casino Royale is simply an unforgettable film of 2006",positive
"In a world of prequels and reboots, this movie stands out. Daniel Craig is not the playboy like Moore or Brosnan, and not as classic as Connery, instead he seems more real to me, and functions like an actual agent: focused, but also struggling to suppress emotions to remain detached. Not exactly mind-blowing performances, but still the best in the 007 series.",positive
A fresh start to Daniel Craig's stint as James Bond. One of my favourites too.,positive
Excellent James Bond movie i would recommend this to anyone..Go see it now!!,positive
"He was a good bond, but not the best. He wasnt much like the other ones and he isnt as sharp.",negative
"Martin Campbell, who also directed Goldeneye, directs Casino Royale, one of the best James Bond movies ever made. This movie revived the franchise with a boom. Daniel Craig shut up naysayers giving a fantastic portrayal and one that resembles Timothy Dalton's in my opinion. In terms of action Casino Royale genuinely doesn't disappoint; experiencing the Madagascar parkour chase in theaters was honestly breathtaking. Adding to the quality cannon is the slick, smooth and catchy intro score, the colorful cinematography, fluid pacing, fun characters and the adequate, albeit forgettable villain Le Chiffre.",positive
Martin Campbell again introduces us to a new Bond star and again gives us a Bond film that we can all be satisfied with.,positive
James Bond doesn't need a reinvention. This movie was much more dull than the previous films. It got quite boring.,negative
The first good james bond movie.,positive
Among the best of 007's adventures. See what happens when you stay close to the books?,positive
Highly enjoyed the opening chase scene.,positive
the best james bond movie ever,positive
"More than just an action flick, Casino Royale is a really smart and intense film that features great direction and acting. Daniel Craig's Bond is the witty badass we all want to be.",positive
Opening chase scene is AMAZING!!!,negative
The best bond movie ever made! Why did the girl have to die!!! OOPS! I wasn't suppose to say that.,positive
Casino Royale introduces us to a Bond with less grace & more brute but still enough suave for a convincing poker face.,positive
"#1 Casino Royale In an era of remakes & reboots, it seemed that the biggest benefactor was 007. When it was announced that Daniel Craig would take over Britain's favorite spy, it created a quite a stir for the Bond faithful. Many asked, ""how can a blond Bond revive the franchise?"". Easy.... Make this Bond physically believable. Not only does Craig physically fit the part, but the guy carries a slight charm & wit that rivals Connery to a tea. With Daniel Craig, James Bond now becomes British version of Jason Bourne, less gadgetry, more physical action. Casino Royale perfectly introduces Bond as he just achieves his double O status. His first mission is to stop terrorist banker, Le Chiffre ( Mads Mikkelson) from making millions by planning terrorist plots to crash the stock market. When Bond foils his plans, Le Chiffre organizes a high stakes poker game to get his money back. Like all the Bond films before, Casino Royale gives us what I believe is the most stunning Bond girl, Vesper Lynd, played by Eva Green. The moment she appears on film, she lights up the screen. The audience sees it & so does Bond. Casino Royale proved to be the most successful James Bond film critically & financially. The story concludes in Bond's first direct sequel, the underrated ""Quantum of Solace"". In short, whether u prefer Connery, Moore, Lazenby, Dalton, Bronson or Craig, one thing is clear, no one does it better than 007. OUT",positive
I love this Bond!!!!,positive
this movie was amazing. the wit and chemistry from it's two stars made this movie rock not to mention all the action and all the twists. Best bond ever!!!!!,positive
Only Bond film I've wanted to watch twice in a row.,positive
"It's Bond, need I say more?",positive
Loved this movie. Daniel Craig is a great new Bond.,positive
"The best Bond movie in years if not in the series, perhaps the best Bond ever. I love this movie!!",positive
OMG I loved the vintage Aston Martin . even better then the new vanquish . plus Eva Green was drop dead sexy,positive
"WOW!! This movie is excellent from start to finish. Daniel Craig is amazing as 007! Definitely the best one since ""Golden Eye"". It might be the best one ever. watching this movie now! It's amazing.",positive
Martin Campbell delivers a great and enjoyable 007 film with Daniel Craig as a fantastic James Bond.,positive
"Admittedly, Bond had gotten silly by this entry, with invisible cars and diamond-faced baddies. And since the gritty reboot is all the rage, Martin Campbell gives us what can only be dubbed as ""The Bond Identity"", stripping away not only all the gadgets, but all of the style, the humor and the atmosphere of a Bond film. Sure, it's a fine action film (despite its ending dragging on for far too long), and relaunching the franchise after the abysmal Die Another Day was certainly necessary. But much like an immunization, just because something is necessary doesn't mean its fun.",negative
"The best Bond film ever made , less campy more in the vein of Bourne . Awesome story and amazing action. Daniel Craig is the perfect portrayal of 007.",positive
Excellent! It has good amount of action and drama. It sure has revitalized the James Bond franchise.,positive
A typical james bond movie.,negative
Best Bond movie for me.,positive
Only scene I didn't care for was when they were sitting around playing poker. Kinda boring...,negative
The perfect way for the Bond series to be recharged - Daniel Craig is ideal.,negative
The stakes have never been blander.,negative
One of the best prequels ever made.,positive
"Let me explain this one. It's a nice, gritty action movie, but it is NOT a James Bond movie. I understand that they wanted to toughen Bond up for modern audiences, but they went way too far. Daniel Craig's performance doesn't even meet the minimum requirements for being James Bond. Is he debonair? No, not really. Does he have spy gadgets? Negative. This character might as well be Jason Bourne. I understand that when this was released the Bourne trilogy was really hot, but just because something is popular doesn't mean that it should always be copied. I don't like this movie because it bears the 007 name but not the character. Also, the second half of the movie is plagued by an insufferable romance comprised of shots that look like they belong in ""Sense and Sensibility"" rather than in a spy movie.",negative
"The first time I watched this movie, I liked it so much I watched it again immediately after. This is the first 007 movie I've been able to stomach.",positive
"A great addition to the 007-series. Daniel Craig as Bond is perfect, his personality makes Bond cool, funny and a shadowy figure.",positive
"Oh god, where do I begin? Many people complain that this the Bond movie where he turned into Jason Bourne as an English Spy. I don't care... I love the poker scenes... Eva Green is so deliciously beautiful and feisty... she also becomes distinguished as being the second Bond Woman. She's more sophiscated than James, while simulaneously being elegant, edgy, and ""skewering"" with her wit. I fell in love with Daniel Craig's Bond. This is his Zero Mission. This is the blunt instrument before the job turned him into a man impervious to pain, danger, and death; before the quips came more often than the bullets. Craig imbues his Bond with this intensity, even when quipping. He may not be as dry as Moore, but he definitely has the deadpan down. The pre-credits scene where Bond gets his ""00"" is completely unique within the canon, and all the more effective for being so. The parkour sequence is the best Bond chase there ever was. Chris Cornell kicks the living shit out of the theme; you know this is going to be a hard-hitting Bond, unlike you've seen before. The chemistry between Craig and Green positively sparkles, and Giancarlo Giannini brings so much personality to Rene Mathis that you barely realize his ""Basil Exposition"" function to the story (Really, there's no other reason for him to be there). No Bond movie has every given me exactly what I wanted from a Bond movie, but Casino Royale comes closest.",positive
This is a Steven Seagal-esque film starring some 'beautiful people'. 007 is routinely surrounded by 50 guys with high powered machine guns but manages to kill everyone every time. He gets kidnapped.....gets set free......blah-blah-blah. Another time waster. Of course I understand that's what most of us are doing when watching these films.,negative
wonderful action with great stunts,positive
"a superb film, action at its finest",positive
O melhor episÃ³dio de toda a saga.,positive
Best of the Bond series.,positive
"not as smooth as some other bonds, but what craig brings to the character with his physicality is cool. def one of the best bond movies",positive
worse bond movie yet. worse buy ever,negative
"I like these lines: Vesper Lynd: There isn't enough room for me and your ego. ------------------------- James Bond: Why is it that people who can't take advice always insist on giving it? ------------------------- Vesper Lynd: Am I going to have a problem with you, Mr. Bond? James Bond: No, don't worry, you're not my type. Vesper Lynd: Smart? James Bond: Single. ------------------------- James Bond: I'm sorry I'm not sorry. ------------------------- Vesper Lynd: I can't resist waking you. Every time I do you look at me as if you hadn't seen me in years. Makes me feel reborn. James Bond: If you had just been born wouldn't you be naked? ------------------------- James Bond: [after Bond has just lost his 10 million in the game, to the bartender] Vodka-martini. Bartender: Shaken or stirred? James Bond: Do I look like I give a damn?",negative
"Best Bond since Connery, by far.",positive
"Excellent film. Daniel Craig is amazing as the young James Bond. It was good to see Bond as a vulnerable man who despite his great talents, could fall in love, could be in trouble, and needed others to help him out. Eva Green is one of the most beautiful women in the world and she is a fine actress to boot. This film set up all the previous Bond character as a womanizing and suave agent beautifully. Must see for all 007 fans.",positive
"craig overall is decent at bond, but casino royale is one of my favorite 007 films",negative
The best Bond movie! thats what i think!,positive
Rare sont les bon James Bond. Celui-là est vraiment bon !,positive
"I have it on DVD. From Columbia Pictures, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It is about the adult with the gun (DANIEL CRAIG), when he kills everybody.",positive
A great film. Definitely the best atmosphere ever produced in a James Bond film...I still think it could have gone a stage darker though.,positive
"Contrary to nostalgic personalities, I consider this to easily be the best of the Bond films. It's exciting, raw, emotional and flat-out fascinating.",positive
I don't like bond movies but Daniel Craig makes me love Bond finally.,positive
Martin Campbell gives Bond an even better treatment than he did with Goldeneye.,positive
"It was the Bond we had all been clamouring for, and we weren't disappointing, he's ditched the dearth and clichÃ (C)s and gained style, flare and a tragic wit that makes for the most human Bond put to screen.",positive
seems almost real compared to previous 007,positive
"Casino Royale is easily the weakest Bond novel penned by series creator Ian Fleming. The high-stakes gambling is hugely suspenseful, but the rest of the story just trudges meekly along until it falls flat. This film saves the plot by amping up the action. It's a good move, especially with Daniel Craig's skillful execution of the lead role.",negative
Bond is cold blooded! Chilling indeed,positive
"James Bond isn't exactly one of my most favorite characters. I find most Bond movies to be boring overall. This one is a bit different and I am thankful for that. Daniel Craig does a great job in this. While this movie isn't without a few slow parts, it is still worth watching.",negative
"A Bond for our times, indeed >>>",positive
"Daniel Craig's first outting is a return to low-key, hard hitting Bond that possesses great action sequences and beautitful scenery. Casino Royale is something that has been missing from 007 since From Russia, with Love.",positive
Thought it was quite a good action film..but it doesn't seem like a Bond movie.. there was always a formula with Bond ..big set pieces..over the top villains..and something that I miss most the great music that created tension.,negative
"Danielle Craig was given the task of shooting the character with an injection of pure, unadulterated reality. His mission was a complete success. It was a shock to the system that turned the heads of even the most avid Bond protestors. This will not only be written down as one of the greatest movies of all time, but also the most incredible recovery of a movie franchise. Long live Craig's James Bond.",positive
Daniel Craig does a good Bond. I thought at first he wasn't. The whole blond hair and blue eyes deal was kinda strage for a Bond but he pulled it off well. This is definetly a watch if your a Bond fan and dont' like all high tech gadgetry in your movies. Althought the car he has is very nice.,positive
"While the film has only simple, static heroic & evil characters and very complicated plot elements written in to fill up the long length that made me quickly lose my attention span, this film proved to become determined at regaining the serious and formal atmosphere of the James Bond films.",negative
Best Bond film by far! The action sequences (like the opening parkour chase) are stunning and you've never seen Bond this emotional and gritty.,positive
"AMAZING FILM, I want to watched it every day for the rest of my life",positive
By far the best Bond movie ever made.,positive
"entertaining, but i didnt feel or think about anything.",negative
"Didn't think I would like Craig, as I was a Timothy Dalton fan. but he gained a follower here. Although the nude torture scene made me cringe. Want to see the next one.",negative
Exactly the reboot Bond needed,positive
"I really like everything about this movie, Daniel Craig's version of James Bond is more realistic and that makes it one of the best 007 movies of all time.",positive
Best Bond film to date.,positive
"Never-before-seen, don't-you-dare-look-away-or-blink fight sequences, from the Algerian sky crane in the beginning to the Venetian water implosion at the end, and brilliant, spot-on performances by Bond-reincarnate Daniel Craig, painfully beautiful Eva Green and classic Bond villain Mads Mikkelsen make this one of the best Bond films since On Her Majesty's Secret Service way back in 1969. Cleverly enough, they used the same action-packed, luxuriously set, love-stricken, heartbreaking formula (took 'em long enough).",positive
Best Bond Film since Connery played 007. Pierce Brosnan who? Daniel Craig did an excellent job as 007 and overall a great movie.,positive
"I liked the pre-Bond Bond. Gritty and violent, it reminded me of the Borne series. One of my favorite Bond movies yet.",positive
Really enjoyed this :),positive
"Suddenly James Bond isn't boring anymore although it's true, it is very much like the Bourne films in style. Only makes sense as a two part story with Quantum of Solace though.",positive
Something about this movie left me cold. I didn't hate it but I wouldn't say I liked it either.,negative
"The perfect bond movie in my mind, and a great way to reinvigorate the series.",positive
"The latest evolution of the Bond franchise is the finest of its history. It trades over-the-top action sequences with slick realistic encounters. Instead of creating another archetypal protagonist, Bond is more vulnerable than ever. The suspense created stems from this vulnerability, and pushes the plot into uncharted territory (for the better).",positive
Love this show. Fast moving show.,negative
"The first Bond flick I had ever seen. About a month and a half later, I'd watched them all. Connery is my favorite but Craig is a close second. Casino Royale totally revamped the whole franchise and created a crazy amount of new followers, myself included.",positive
"Casino offers a more believable Bond, more human and more intrepid than before. It also offers a more elaborated plot and psychological character development, while delivering action at the proper time. I can certainly go on with this re-imagination of Bond and all that it offers, because it's likeable and realistic, and also intense. Craig delivers a Bond unlike any other, Green delivers a very amazing Bond girl, again, unlike any other. And Mikkelsen also delivers quite a Bond villian, once more, unlike any other Bond villian. The overall experience of watching Casino Royale is amazing, but not perfect. Nevertheless, it worth your money and life time of two hour-and a half.",positive
No as good as I expected,negative
"Watched this again late last nite after a rough week....what a great flic!!!!! Might give ""Quantum Of Solace"" another go tonite!!!!! Looking forward to ""Skyfall"", filming now!!!!",positive
Saw this when it became available On Demand in 2006 or so. Saw it again a few days ago (January 2012). It was like seeing a whole new movie because I did not remember 99% of it. Gasps and shrieks came out of me multiple times. The musc was good and intense!,positive
"WOW!! This movie is excellent from start to finish. Daniel Craig is amazing as 007! Definitely the best one since ""Golden Eye"". It might be the best one ever.",positive
Daniel Craig and that sexy music.,positive
Good introduction to an interesting new James Bond.,negative
"Thus far, my favorite Bond movie w/ Daniel Craig as James Bond. I still think this movie revived the Bond franchise. I love seeing Bond still forming & growing. He's still unpolished & a bit brutish. And I never get tired of watching the opening chase scene...just amazing!",positive
Best Bond film. Period.,positive
A freaking impressive reboot of the James Bond franchise.,positive
"James Bond: ""I've got a little itch, down there. Would you mind?"" Things I have to say about this movie: -AWESOME -smart -funny (probably on accident) -BeSt JaMeS bOnD yET!!!!! 5 stars *****",positive
"Nearly perfect action movie. The only reason I'm not rating it 5 stars is because it can't share the stage with Seven Samurai. Oh, and that double ending. But that's ok.",positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond around which makes this the best Bond film of them all. Phenomenally directed and acted this is an astonishing action film that had me captivated from start to finish.,positive
"Excellent movie! I loved it, and I am not a fan of Bond movies as a rule!",positive
"A heartless, cold, incredibly frustrating movie.",negative
"Aside from the immortal Goldfinger, this is the best Bond film. Almost flawless in every way.",positive
"Best modern version of 007. Good story, solid action. Better than Sean Connery? Are you crazy?",positive
"Great action movie with ton of fighting and a couple chase scenes. A sophisticated and grown up bond movie with less cheese and fun and instead more drama and emotion. Not too many gadgets or laughs in this version. The cinematography is beautiful (lots of foreign cars, foreign women, and foreign locales) the acting is done well, script is smart, costumes are good, and it is just a nicely detailed slick movie with plot twists galore. Daniel Craig is a great bond and this is the best out of the series.",positive
"In my opinion one of the best, if not the best bond movie to date.",positive
"You never fully realize how much people overuse operatic music in trailer until they somehow work it into James Bond's theme song. Don't get me wrong, that music was amazing, but really, when you actually see the trailer, it makes you think that the climax of the film will involve James Bond riding an armored stallion over the horizon with face paint and a spear as he cries, ""For England!"", and he's got his suit on the whole time. Man, I would have loved to see the look on Roger Ebert's then-still put-together face; those 4 out of 4 stars wouldn't sound very fitting anymore, would they? Of course, Martin Campbell wouldn't be having any of that John Glen bull. After Campbell made the plane scene at the beginning of ""GoldenEye"" seem perfectly reasonable, there's no going back to the Tarzan swing from ""Octo...well, you know, so of course I'm glad that, at long last, the best Bond director of all time is back to kick up the realism, intrigue, mystery and, well, ""Bourne"" factor. I don't know exactly how a series can ripoff something that ripped it off, but eitherway, the guy who clearly had some influence on [b]Ja[/b]son [b]Bo[/b]ur[b]n[/b]e is back to show us how it's really done, thus resulting in not only a satisfying reboot of the ""007"" series, but the...-wait for it-...[b]the best installment yet[/b]! Of course, that just means that it ties with the other best installments, because although Campbell is once again bringing his sharp game, it's not enough to raise this film past its predecessors and certainly not past its flaws. Now, as great of a director as Martin Campbell is for the series, he wasn't without his share of missteps in ""GoldenEye"" and he most certainly isn't without them here, and that much is made painfully clear very early on, with the first action sequence. Don't get me wrong, it's an absolutely amazing action sequence, but it goes on not just way too long, but longer than any previous gratuitously overlong action sequence, and this series has had some long stunts. After that, the action sequences aren't as long, and if they are, they're not as gratuitously prolonged, but always go into an action sequence in this film, fearing that it will overstay it's welcome, because chances are, it will. However, when we don't get that, there's some aura of genericism in the air, with the film feeling not necessarily love a run-of-the-mill ""Bond"" film, but a very familiar spy thriller. That really does bump down the momentum of the film, as do a deal of slow spots. Tightness, uniqueness and consistent tension are key to this easily becoming the stand-alone best ""Bond"" yet. However, as it stands, Martin Campbell is once again a key factor in this film's being among the finest installments, because for every misstep made, Campbell makes up for it by delivering on what you'd imagine he would. In case y'all are on the fence on how great of a director Martin Campbell is for the series, allow me to tell you: He made an opener with limited relevance to the main story... actually work, making it short, sweet, to the point and organic; and ladies and gentlemen, that's only the beginning of his impressive feats with this film. If you're going be discussing a ""007"" film, you'll rarely not be praising the action, and this film is most certainly no different, because although most of these action sequences are far from air tight, you're rarely, if ever disengaged, because Campbell knows how to keep the action going, and not just because the editing is loose. The foot chase sequence very early on film is that especially loose action sequence that I alluded to earlier, but what I didn't tell y'all is that it is so broadly-scoped, so slick and so wildly dynamic in its choregraphy and staging, that the two characters that make up most of the whole battle - Bond and his target -, alone, create a battle scenario that's so epic in tone and scope, that you're just waiting for King Kong to jump in from out of no where, taking on three of those V-Rexes, or whatever Peter Jackson called them. That is just one of the good deal of dynamic, tense and consistently exciting action sequences, which are complimented by the film's sharp sound design, the occasional great visual effects, as well as one of the best scores of the entire series. It should go without saying that the cinematography is complimentary, because, seeing as this is a recent ""Bond"" film, it's to be expected that this film would have great shots, and sure enough, there are plenty of neat and handsome, yet subtle shots that compliment action, when it's not complimenting the grand locations. However, Campbell doesn't just deliver on action, because, you have to remember that this is the guy who shattered ground with this series when he introduced the idea of making it a deeper, more intriguing saga, and while this film does have plenty of charm - complimented by some excellent dialogue -, Campbell is once again showing us why everyone started following his lead after ""GoldenEye"" by bringing us more consequence, realism and grit, whether it be through Bond taking a couple of hard punches himself to reflect his humanity, or reflection on the true harshness of the scenarios Bond finds himself in, particularly at the emotionally resonant, deeply satisfying ending that, I must admit, kind of had me choking up. Again, were the film tighter and a little more heavy, it would be much more compelling, and certainly much better, but as things stand, Campbell still keeps you going through thick and thin, yet most certainly doesn't do it alone. Upon arriving in the Bahamas, Bond is mistaken for a car valet, but kindly accepts the man's keys anyways, only to drive the man's car around the parking lot and then drive it, reverse, into a parking space, taking out the safety rails, the cars on the other side and setting off a couple of alarms, before he gets out and throws the keys, probably to where that big fat dirtbag will have a tough time finding them. As if him doing that while in a shirt and khaki pants wasn't enough evidence, that moment is just one of countless that shows you that we really are dealing with a less experienced, less suave and, well, less ""James Bond"" James Bond. Now, we've seen everyone's favorite spy be a jerk in installments before, but here, that is actually a genuine reflection of his humanity, rather than his inhumanity, as it shows his selfishly human desire for the power and recognition that he eventually earns, and that there is more plaguing him than we ever knew about. Speaking of ""GoldenEye"", I loved the sequence that really defined that the film was going for a more serious ""Bond"", in which the antagonist calls Bond on his bull and questions whether all of the alcohol, women and thrills that he's famous for is for pleasure, or to try and forget and change, and this film seems to be showing us that transformation, something that the newcoming Daniel Craig nails with subtlety and grace. After claiming his first traumatizing kill in front of the beautiful Eva Green's character, Vesper Lynd, Bond retreats to his hotel bathroom to clean up, and after doing so, he pours himself a drink and stares at himself in the mirror, letting relief, anxiety, confusion and self-analysis set in, all at the same time, and the way Craig sells that and many other scenes really shows his competence, both as an actor and as a Bond. Sure, he's probably the least convincing-looking casting choice thus far, and while he does have plenty of charm, he's not quite with the charisma that Connery, Moore or even Brosnan had. However, this time, Bond isn't suppose to have all that; but instead, pure humanity, complete with anguish, layers and subtlety, and watching Craig portray that effortlessly not only makes him a compelling lead and deserving of becoming the household name that this film helped him become, but one of the best Bonds to ever grace the franchise with his presence. In the end, it's slowed down by, well, slow spots, as well a generic aura, when we're not dealing with overlong action sequences, leaving the film incapable of being the knockout it very easily could have been, but with Campbell delivering slick visuals - as well as hardcore action, when he's not delivering more on the intrigue and humanity that he really changed the whole series with -, as well as a deeply human, compellingly layered and generally excellent performance by the newcoming and ever so welcomed Daniel Craig, ""Casino Royale"" stands as both a satisfying reboot for the saga, as well as a captivating dramatic portrait on its own. 3/5 - Good",positive
Best bond movie I have seen in a long time Daniel Craig is best bond since Sean Connery,positive
O JB não agora não é mais o mesmo. Deu até sono assistindo o filme. Totalmente diferente o personagem.,negative
"Casino Royale is a tough movie to diagnosis. The movie is a prequel, and this knowledge is essential for understanding why 007 is the way he is in all the previous bond movies. The movie is much more gritty than the previous bond movies, but this is because he is a beginning rogue like agent that doesn't have the finesse and skills that you have seen in the previous movies. Going in to the movie with this mentality makes the movie make much more sense, and as a result you will find that Casino Royale is a fantastic Bond movie, and one of the best in the series.",positive
"a good movie, but Bond seams to ceases to be as independent as in other movies",negative
"as far as james bond movies go, this was pretty good. and no matter what the die hard bond fans say daniel craig is a really good looking bond.",negative
"While there were doubts about Daniel Craig's ability to carry the James Bond franchise for the foreseeable future, Casino Royale proves that Daniel Craig is a powerhouse actor capable of both balls-to-the-wall action sequences, and memorable dialog delivery, all while sticking close to the persona of a suave, smooth secret agent.",positive
"Hate me all you want, but this might be my favorite Bond film.",positive
"I've never been very in to James Bond, but thanks to Daniel Craig and this remake, I am now! I can't say enough about Craig and this movie, so I'll just say that I would have sex with both of them.",positive
"This film has become my gold standard by which all other Bond films are measured. It sounds ridiculous because Casino Royale does not follow any of the patterns from the Bond films of the past. Famous lines are never uttered, not one nifty gadget is ever used, and heaven forbid he's blonde! But seriously, this reboot has a very different feel from any prior Bond movie. Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond is so far removed from Brosnan's that it's almost silly to hear them both called by the same name. Seldom in the history of the franchise has Bond been more human than he is in Casino Royale. Sure he is still amazingly agile, intelligent, and brave but somehow we can identify with him. A big part of that is the fact that he experiences real emotions. Love and heartbreak actually exist in his world. Perhaps the most remarkable difference between this Bond and the Bond of the past is that he makes mistakes. Fallibility helps us connect with characters and empathize with their struggles. This Bond actually gets hurt, frequently, which also makes him feel real. I could just go on and on, but I'll spare you the gushing, suffice it to say Craig was a great casting decision. Speaking of great casting decisions, Eva Green is perfect. She is prickly and terse at the beginning, but you can feel her slowly succumbing to her emotions and falling for Bond. I loved the little surprise reveal of Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter, because I never saw it coming when I first saw the film, and it was nice to have a beloved character from the Bond novels back in action. The cast of villains are all delightfully evil, and it's easy to hate them. It's pretty remarkable how they managed to make Le Chiffre so unlikeable that I felt no sympathy when his life was threatened by some of his clients. Finally the entertaining Giancarlo Giannini gives us an old, grizzled veteran to play a nice counterpoint to the new Bond. He's left with the difficulty of plot exposition frequently, and even explaining the game of Texas Hold 'Em a couple times, but he does it in a way that you hardly notice that's what he's doing. Overall a great cast that impresses me every time I watch the film. Oh, I'm not done singing the praises of Casino Royale. We also have some of the greatest action sequences in Bond history. The parkouring chase scene looks amazing. The fight on the airport runway is so good. Even something as simple as a Bond's first kill is gritty and intense. But what makes this film unique isn't the action, it is the love story, something that almost feels out of place in a Bond film. We're so used to Bond being a user of women, remaining emotionally detached. Perhaps that is what gives this relationship that added heart-breaking power, because we see a man who always remained distant suddenly allowing his barriers to come down. On Her Majesty's Secret Service is the only other Bond film I can remember with that kind of emotion. Although Casino Royale is quite different from what viewers have come to expect in James Bond films, I find it to be a refreshing change and the best movie in the franchise. If I were to admit any fault it would be that the film is perhaps a little long, but since I enjoy it so much I relish every minute of it's 2.5 hour runtime.",positive
Good James Bond movie,negative
"Excellent movie. Very cool, very strong, powerful, with an excellent debut performance from Craig.",positive
Tremendous update on the Bond series. This movie has one great action scene after the next. Daniel Craig is excellent as Bond. The supporting cast is really good as well. At no point does the story drag. A must see for any Bond fan.,positive
Much better than most Bond movies. Was actually realistic.,positive
"One of my favorite Bond movies. Daniel Craig may not look like a Bond, but his acting fits it perfectly. This movie is terrific from start to finish with amazing action scenes right off the bat. Nothing beats the poker scene though.",positive
We have a new James Bond and Daniel Craig did an excellent job as Bond. We saw how Bond started out and why he is the way he is.,positive
"This recent entry in the Bond series,has to be one of the best. it finally shows us that bond is human an has problems just like the rest of the world.We are finally seeing a bond movie that isn't all CGI like the last few. I thnk we finally have a bond movie for the 21st century.",positive
basically the best bond since sean connery - and did i mention he is fine,positive
The best james bond!!,positive
hands down favorite bond. craig brings bond to life,positive
A nearly perfect action movie.,positive
Typical James Bond. Every explosion beats the one before it.,positive
"A LOT better than i remember. I finally gave it another shot, while i still like Skyfall more for the Daniel Craig Bonds, Casino Royale is a close second.",positive
Superb on so many levels.,positive
I personally feel that this movie helped reinvent the Bond franchise and made it not-sucky.,positive
Pleasantly ridiculous.,negative
Daniel Craig is the best since Connery,positive
"Nunca me han gustado las películas de Bond, pero con esta me la pasé muy bien, escenas de acción bien ejecutadas, una historia medianamente interesante y Eva Green como chica Bond, entretenimiento palomitero a full.",negative

MUST SEE FILM. Who would have known that this guy would be a good james bond?,positive
"Overall, pretty darn good",positive
SO GRITTY and fantastic,positive
"This is arguably the best James Bond film ever. Sean who? Daniel Craig almost makes you completely forget anyone played James Bond before him. A much needed and welcome injection of reality and brutality into the tired series. ""James Bond will return?"" James Bond HAS returned! Not to mention it stands as a great action film in its own right.",positive
"The best Bond film, bar none",positive
Quite entertaining. Too long and too many stories. But enjoyed the class and style. The love story totally did it for me :),negative
"I've always been hesitant of James Bond films mostly based on the fact I'd rather not spend hours watching Connery, Moore, or Dalton weasel on top of a woman. Yet this installment helmed by Daniel Craig and Martin Campbell has brought me back into the series. Action packed with incredible effects and several impressive plot twists, ""Casino Royale"" delivers the perfect spy film atmosphere as well as incorporating a necessary heartbreaking ""Abyss""-like underwater scene. Which in the end is what any and every Bond film should be. It also just happens to be the 900th film I've had the pleasure to write a review for as well as my last film of 2011.",positive
"Casino Royale is loaded with the best ingredients that make a Bond film: hyperactive stunt work, coldly calculative villains and vixenish dames; but it's Craig's daring approach to the passive Bond that gives the film such surprising depth and allows us to, layer by layer, get into the mind of a man who's tensions boil like a ticking time bomb, as their wont to do under such stressful circumstances.",positive
Awesome new take on a classic series!,positive
"One of my very favorite films of all time, Casino Royale was a nerve wracking experience for me when I first saw it in theaters in 2006. I decided to go it alone that night, as my friends were busy and I was girlfriendless. I remember trying to awkwardly make small talk with those around me as we waited for the movie to start. The critics had already decided it was great thanks to advance screenings, but I was till sore over losing Pierce Brosnan, the Bond I grew up with (especially since he wanted to do another film). Nothing could've prepared me for the intense emotional thrill ride that I was Casino Royale. From the riveting black and white opening and the astounding opening credits sequence, I was very much hooked. Daniel Craig not only worked as 007, he was giving the best performance since Sean Connery. Never once did you believe he was only a playboy, or an agent. You knew that when you stared deep into his eyes, he was a stone cold killer. This kind of intensity energized every scene, action or non. Not only had the performances changed, but the presence of camp and gadgets had vanished altogether. What was left was a hyper reality, far more dangerous and unpredictable than previous 007's. I could go on for many paragraphs and analyze every facet of the film, but rather, you should watch it for yourself. To say it's a movie that has some surprising twists is an understatement. You'll see why. I'll never forget watching Casino Royale. Forever one of my greatest movie going experiences, Casino Royale was the rare type of movie that helped me to appreciate those around me and to be a better person... for 007's sake of course.",positive
"Casino Royale has great action, great locations, and a great love story which makes it easily the best Bond movie of them all.",positive
Sin duda del top 3 de james bond,negative
"It's too damn long, it doesn't hold my attention after the first hour, it is a good movie though...especially the ending.",negative
Craig is the best Bond ever!!!!!,positive
Craig's performance rivals connery's best,positive
"Freaking amazing. Just as crazy as MI3. I thought the romance was adorable and his kicking butt was... indescribable. Oh, and his whole not dieing after being poisoned was great.",positive
"No more silly gadgets and over-the-top nonsense here, folks. Casino Royale delivers a very honest, intense, and stylish entry into the series that is so great you'll probably watch it more than once.",positive
one of my favorite bond movies... excellent acting and great plot. there isnt as much action in this one as in the others but it still is extremely entertaining,positive
"Not a fan of James Bond, but I was really digging this one.",positive
Daniel Craig's performance as James Bond will be remembered for quite a long time..,positive
Spectacular. Best Bond movie ever? Just might be.,positive
though the movie wasnt that great he was the best bond yet,negative
"the adaption of the first bond novel is also the first bond film i've ever seen, and it's opened up a fandom that i need to explore. Casino Royale is the Bond i was hoping for to lift me into the other films, although i hear alot of them are really silly.",positive
One of the best Bond movies ever made. The only downside is that it was a little too long for the story that was being told.,positive
Dan Craig does seem to be the most perfect actor to portray Bond.. Casino Royale is hands down the most classy of all post-Sean Connery Bond flicks.,negative
Best Bond movie ever..until Skyfall probably. This is how a 007 should be. Not the Pierce Brosnan shit. Daniel Craig is the best 007 since Connery.,positive
"Gritty, raw Bond for Gen Y. It works.",positive
"Dark,Thrilling & The Best James Bond Film Complete Awesome Full House 100/100",positive
Best Bond since Goldeneye.,positive
This to me is my favorite film. There isn't one scene were I wasn't on the edge of my seat! Ive always loved the James Bond films and this was no exception! 10/10,positive
"The BEST Bond movie this side of ""Goldfinger"" and ""From Russia With Love"".",positive
"A very solid action movie but it's not a James Bond movie. Never once did i say to myself watching previous Bond movies ""they should go grittier!"" Bond is a character who avoided violence, drank expensive martinis and hooked up with gorgeous women. I like Daniel Craig as Bond but they shouldn't call these Bond movies.",negative
"It's a bit long, and at times I found myself bored.",negative
"I like the directon the new Bond movies have taken. Daniel Craig's brute force approach to the character is refreshing after decades of the tepid, smarmy performances given by the likes of Brosnan, Dalton, and Moore's later work. Fewer gadgets, more character development, more action... all good elements the new guides of the series are bringing to the table. I'm looking forward to Skyfall.",negative
"My favorite Bond film to date, but it loses half a star for the final poker match... That would never happen.",positive
"After hating James Bond movies for as long as I can remember, Daniel Craig has done what no other Bond could do for me.... actually convinced me that this franchise is no longer stale an boring. Craig takes on a completely new an original Bond persona, a hero who gets dirty and injured and is not always immaculately turned out. Completely awesome film and I loved every minute of it.",positive
"Arguably one of the best bond movies ever made. Daniel Craig is the perfect bond, with a well written plot and awesome action.",positive
"Good for an action movie, but strays pretty far from the 007 formula.",positive
Easily the film that made James Bond cool again. Daniel Craig is perhaps the best man to wear the tux since Sean.,positive
"Daniel Craig gives Bond a badass image, which was desperately needed",positive
I didn't think Daniel Craig would be a good Bond. Then I realized.. he was second best to Sean Connery.,positive
"After being unsure of the future of Bond, I was very pleased with Casino Royale. It proved any worries to be completely unnecessary. Daniel Craig was a great Bond, pulling off very hard and gritty moments and also the softer charming moments we all love. Can't wait to see his second outing as I love the Bond series.",positive
My new favourite Bond film. Contains my favourite fight of any film. The wince educing realistic toilet fight. Face plant through ceramic sink!...ooohhh!,positive
An action packed movie with Bond being more active and violent than in any previous movie.,positive
"It's a bit long, and at times I found myself bored.",negative
A refreshing change from the ridiculousness of the Brosnan Bond.,positive
this is daniel craigs best movie!,positive
James Bond gets a face lift. Daniel Craig brings a fresheness to one of Hollywood's oldest franchises. Casino Royale rejects the Bond formula and give James Bond some personality. This is Bond's first mission after getting his 00 status. Bond must find an international banker who takes money from terrorists only to invest it in high stakes stocks. The banker loses one hundred million dollars and is desperate to get the money back. The British government sees an opportunity if the can stop the banker from getting the money they can blackmail him into giving them his terrosit contacts. The banker must win his money back at a very exensive poker game and the story goes from there. Casino Royale is an excellent installment to the Bond franchise. The stunts are spectacular and the story is great. Great addition to the Bond brand.,positive
"Only 007 movie I ever wanted to see. Fight scenes look unreal, but found out they were. Pretty cool.",positive
"The best Bond film ever made. Story, action, suspense, romance, it has it all. Daniel Craig steps into James Bond's shoes and proves he is the best Bond to date. Even better than the great Sean Connery. Quite an accomplishment.",positive
Lot of crazy action in this movie,negative
Very good action movie & suspence,negative
"Absolutely riveting. My favorite Bond picture for its visceral action sequences, wonderful script, and terrific performances. It all comes together here. First rate.",positive
One of the greatest James Bond films of all time. Daniel Craig is the true James Bond. I loved every second of this movie.,positive
Craig is a short and ugly 007. Yikes!,negative
"A lot more serious than the other James Bond movies, and yet a very good movie. Daniel Craig does a good job as James Bond. He's no Sean Connery, but at least his acting isn't half bad.",positive
its one of the deepest 007 films in the line up very good,positive
"Casino Royale still stands as one of my favorite James Bond films and is a masterpiece in filmmaking. I use the term ""masterpiece"" because I think the Bond film have really found their potential with this film and the Bond films always seem to stay great and never age, but Casino Royale really just takes us into James Bond's world and gives a more truthful interpretation of Ian Flemming's original novel and character. The action is thrilling and exciting, the espionage really gets me at the tip of my seat, and Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery himself. I liked Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore, but Connery and Craig currently stand as my favorite Bonds. Casino Royale is one of my favorite spy films and one of my favorite action films, and is my favorite film in the James Bond series.",positive
"One of my favorites, surprisingly, since it has a sort of sad ending.",positive
A perfect way to reboot the James Bond series,positive
The best bond film since the 60s,positive
"Near perfect Bond film even if Craig isn't a near perfect Bond.it's one of the darker bonds and for me sits with the living daylights and goldeneye as a darker bond film. Every bond actor has brought their own to the poker table but are incomparable because of it. Thoroughly enjoyable Bond movie with excellent plot and realism, no silly gadgets here.personally the half a star missing is due to Daniel Craig not quite being Bond, it's a difficult one, I'm a massive Connery Bon fan and grew up with brosnans goldeneye and then later got into roger moores 80's bonds and Timothy Dalton was great in the living daylights too, seeing as the previous are now way to old to play bond and especially bonds earlier days then it's impossible to imagine them in this film. However I've come to the conclusion that Brosnan as he was in Goldeneye would make casino royale a five star film.",positive
Really badass movie. Loved it. The only problem I had was that it got slow at some parts.,negative
daniel craig has to be my favorite bond. he makes you take him seriously.,negative
An excellent reboot. This one more then makes up for the awful world is not enough and the almost completely unlikeable die another day. Danielle craig is an excellent and in my opion the best since connery. my 2nd favorite bond next to goldfinger.,positive
"Martin Campbell returns to the scene since directing Pierce in GoldenEye. This time he has a even bigger task than his 1995 film. He had to reintroduce a new actor playing Bond...Daniel Craig. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery (Timothy Dalton would be second, Pierce would be third, Roger Moore would be fourth, and George would be last). Finally we the movie i always wanted to see...what made Bond become the man that we all know him to be. Daniel Craig gives us a more darker intense bond than Timothy Dalton did (and never gets the respect that he deserves for his films). He's not perfect...he doesn't gives a damn about anything except for completing his mission. He falls in love for the first time and receives his first heartbreak too. I love how Martin takes his time with the story and building up the suspense and giving us intense action that we haven't seen before in the previous Bond films. This time the action serves the story. This is a masterpiece from the first moment I seen it in theater.",positive
"Has everything a spy movie should have, minus the silly gadgets (sorry Q).",positive
"Bond is back! Or is he? This film blew me away. The settings, the score, the script and of course the hard b****** that is Daniel Craig as James bond. A stunning debut and a surprisingly faithful adaption of Flemings original novel.",positive
"The reviews show consensus: Casino Royale may be the best post-Connery 007 movie ever to have been written and filmed, forsaking the girls, guns, and gadgets formula that floated Brosnan's boat. Tightly acted, dark, and intense, this new twist on the 007 saga is fresh and appeals to all audiences, bringing 007 back to being human.",positive
"Fantastic re-re-boot of the franchise. Unlike the Brosnan films, Casino Royale adds depth to Bond; a side of him we've never seen. It loses the silliness of recent entries, rewriting the entire history of James Bond.",positive
I loved this movie you have to see it he's so hot,positive
Daniel Craing is not Pierce Brosnan but the film was pretty good ... I enjoyed it twice ... good film and on bluray just brilliant ....,positive
never was a james bod fan. still not a fan,negative
"Entertaining, but slightly disappointed.",negative
"Fantastic! Casino Royale breaks the norm, shows us a Bond-before-Bond, gives us a wonderful supporting actress (Eva Green), and developes a real connection between the two characters, before (SPOILER) taking that connection away, and making him the character we know today. The Casino Bond is, in many ways, more fun than the typical Bond. One of my favorite scenes involves a waiter asking Bond how he would like his Martini, to which Bond, in anger, replies: ""Do I look like I give a damn?"" This frankness about him, this arrogance and overconfidence bring out a freshness in a character long in need of a makeover. More than just having fantastic character development, Casino Royale is gorgeous to look at, fun to watch, a real treat for all lovers of film",positive
Better than expected Bond and one of the best,negative
"Great movie! all the 007 movies are like that: smart plans, adventure, action, great scenes! love it",positive
"Wow! This movie is awesome! the whole movie is so intense!!! I couldn't even tell who the villain was until the end! This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and biting my nails! Not to mention, Daniel Craig is SO HOT!!!!!!!! Wow! Those eyes! great movie, great plot, great hottie, uh... i mean actor!",positive
Best Bond film ever. Eva Green is spectacularly cast.,positive
"I was a James Bond fan before this movie. I'm an even bigger fan now. All of the previous movies seemed to be on a collegiate level. This movie seems more adult. More grown up. And, I like it. Gone are the days of Q, and a I do miss the late, great Desmond Llewellyn. And, also gone is the predictable format that the movies were laid out in. Everything in the movie seemed doable. Le Chiffre didn't have an underwater empire or a space station. He was a cut throat business man. Intelligent, yes. Evil, deliciously so. Mads Mikkelsen played the role in spades. And, Giancarlo Giannini nearly stole the show as Mathis. And, Bond gets the crap beaten out of him. He feels pain and has the cuts & bruises to prove it. Onward & upward for the James Bond franchise.",positive
My favorite 007 that Daniel Craig has done.,negative
This film was quite well..,negative
The epitome of what bond movies should be.,positive
James Bond is classic!!!,positive
"This is how Bond should be. Captured the story so well, defined the character and he was more ruggid and kick ass. When you think its over, it isnt. One of the best films I have ever seen.",positive

"An entertaining movie with action and a stable history. First, Daniel Craig has the burden of playing James Bond, and does it well. The film begins with pretty good action sequences, for after his pace down a bit and then back. Another thing that is favorable, is that the casino scenes, when they make big bets, you feel the tension and manages to catch you. At the end Casino Royale is a movie with action, tension, with a positive reinvention of James Bond and a very good end.",positive
This might be the best 007 movie ever.,positive
"My favorite of the Bond series and a brilliant action movie. Daniel Craig, Eva Green and Mads Mikkelsen do a great job in their roles and Craig truly makes bond his his own. the only thing i didn't like about the film was how it seemed like it ended and then it started again but didn't finish as solid. a good film with brilliant action sequences, great acting and good direction. Plus as with all bond films it has a great soundtrack",positive
007 movies were annoying as fuck until craig came in all his badassness,negative
"Definitely way up there on my ""I can watch this movie again pretty much anytime"" list. Total shot in the arm for the Bond franchise; Daniel Craig is fantastic as the lead. If somehow you haven't seen this movie yet, well, get to it...as in now.",positive
"Bond is back and better than ever in the form of Daniel Craig in a breakthrough performance. As for the movie itself? It's close to perfect. The action is fast, adrenaline-fueled, and most significantly, believable (the foot chase in Madagascar will make your jaw drop. That's a promise). On top of that, the story is great, and the film's Bond Villain and Bond Girl are two of the franchise's best",positive
"Casino Royale isn't simply the best Bond film in years. It is one of the best Bond films ever. Expertly directed by Martin Campbell, Casino Royale revives, rejuvenates and refreshes the 007 series, proving the continuing viability of Fleming's creation 50 years after his inception. Gritty and thrilling, Casino Royale has it all - action, glamour, spectacular locations and a new Bond that is above all, vulnerable. Daniel Craig's debut portrayal as 007 is marvelous; showing a depth and grit of character that easily makes him the most realistic Bond since Sean Connery. Casino Royale has a license to thrill that leave you happily shaken and stirred. This is easily one of my favourite movies of all time.",positive
Incredible. Great acting. I feel stupid for having waited so long to see it!,positive
It's a darker and more powerful bond. It's got fantastic performances. It's sleek brutal and well made. I just really disliked the ending.,positive
"This Bond does away with gadgets, campy acting and not so great fight scenes in a welcome return for the Bond franchise as it gives a more gritty and realistic take on 007",positive
"Based upon the first James Bond book, this isn't just your usual action fare, it's a much more developed, darker Bond, a great movie for all action fans, and all moviegoers.",positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever!!,positive
"*Facepalm* Ah, personally I found this movie to be absolutley terrible! I think this is a movie, that's gotten way more credit than it deserves. The original bonds movies were good, why couldn't this one be it?",negative
"I was honestly really surprised with this. It was really nice and well refreshing to see Bond have a heart and fall in love. The acting was solid, by both leads Daniel Craig (Bond) and Eva Green (Vesper Lynd). Thought the plot was good. Great action sequences. All around a superb bond flick, and I can't wait to see more.",positive
"I saw this 3 times at the theater because i enjoyed it so much. It does have its flaws but to be honest a film is a film you either like it or not and even though i didn't care much for Daniel Craig as the new Bond, i really liked the villains and supporting actors. Mads Mikkelsen really held my interest. The opening credits was a treat in itself.",positive
"Reinvented for sure! The opening 15 minutes where Bond chases 'The Bombmaker' sets up a nice base for the whole 2 hours. The locations were splendid, especially the Czech Republic town of Carlsbad which is called, 'Montenegro.' I thought the scene where Bond walks out from the ocean resembled the one in Dr. No performed by 'Ursula Andress'. The dialogues were amazing especially the ones between M and Bond. Daniel Craig justified his role as James Bond. However, Moneypenny, and Q Branch were missing just as in Dr. No (based on my recollection of Dr. No) and he thanks M for Aston Martin DB 5 parked outside the hotel, 'I love too M'. Also, he doesn't introduce himself, for instance, in Bahamas, he says,'he has a reservation' rather than the usual 'The name's Bond, James Bond!' Vesper adds much needed spice during the second half where they both meet for an introductory banter on the high-speed train while travelling to 'Montenegro'. I am not sure, why 'Mathis' is introduced as 009 or 007. Good to see Bond moving away from his image of a womaniser, chain smoker who drinks 'Dom Perignon 53' and 'Vodka Martini' shaken not stirred, especially when he says,'do I look I give a damn' when asked how does he like it and starts using a GPS enabled 'Sony Ericsson Phones' in keeping with times.",negative
Great entry into the Bond series. Really revitalized the series. Daniel Craig plays a great bond and the rest of the cast plus all the cool technology really take this movie up a notch. Highly enjoyable,positive
"Feels like, dare I say it, even more than a Bond movie. Brilliant action, Craig is fantastic and even the elongated poker scenes are engrossing. This film focuses in on the best bits of Bond, and my only critisism is Eva Greens character and her slightly ""bashed together and addend onto the end"" subplot. Apart from that, it's awesome!",positive
"I cannot believe all of the positive reaction to this movie. I don't know why they tried to reformat the James Bond archetype, and further, I disliked what they did. Maybe I'm missing something. But, how could they kill the hottest girl in the movie - before he has sex with her? Bond ordering anything but his usual drink? The torture scene? A tremendously weak villain, aaand, a super-long poker scene with an incredibly anti-climactic end? I like dark movies, and I usually like something 'different'. However, for this film, I say, ""Boo.""",negative
"Craig gives Bond a healthy bad-ass reality check- he keeps the charisma and adds a layer of vulnerability that enriches the performance. The action scenes are superbly edited, and the sets are lavish (as expected from a JB film). The heightened sense of realism really makes this not only one of the strongest installments of the franchise but one of the best action films of the decade.",positive
Daniel Craig destroy the genre,negative
My second favorite Bond movie! I doubt I'll see a 007 flick in the future that will top Casino! Epic and a modern classic,positive
"As a fan of the first 20 Bonds, I was really worried that the reboot would cause some problems. However, I think that it successfully recharged the series back to the days of Connery and Moore. I now personally look to the Brosnan films as the low point because those movies lacked so much from the earlier films. I especially appreciated the return of the subtle amounts of humor which were put into the otherwise action story. Overall, I think that the new direction did successfully update Bond into the 21st, non USSR century. At the same time however, it is a bit odd to just ""forget"" that the first 20 films never happened.",positive
"Even after Skyfall, this seems like the best Bond movie ever.",positive
While a lot of Bond fans say Daniel Craig was not a good choice for the role I actually enjoyed him. Sure he isn't the best choice but I think he did a good job. I liked the poker scene myself. Over all good movie.,negative
read my review here: http://www.nobadmovie.net/2011/07/casino-royale.html,positive
"I originally saw this movie in theaters and I did not like it, but when I rewatched it to give it a second chance, I really enjoyed it. Although this was Daniel Craig's first bond role and he seems to not have fully adjusted to it, I liked it that he was getting used to the role because it was like he was getting used to be a 007 agent. This movie was an intro movie for the next two, so I understand why they had to develop his character in a certain way. Although the theme was a little light compared to Quantum, I enjoyed it nonetheless and I believe that this bond trilogy is shaping up to be the best one in Bond history.",positive
the greatest franchise reboot ever,positive
"Craig deserved awards recognition. For me, it's easily in the top 3 best bond films. It's truly everything you'd want out of a bond film, albeit w/ a more serious tone. It's also just a great action film",positive
The only Bond film that I can watch and not think of it as a Bond film.,positive
"Casino Royale succeeds because of its difference from other Bond films. Craig plays a fascinating, troubled Bond with sinister underlinings. The story is absolutely fascinating, and the tension is tight, proving that not every spy film has to be an actionpacked one to be great.",positive
One of the better thrillers of the decade and one of the better Bond films,positive
Not much of a Bond fan but Daniel Craig rocks this character. wasn't going to even watch it till i was told how great he made this movie,positive
I loved this film is the best of the series even the old ones this tops it for definate,positive
Great Bond flick. Slam bang fun.,positive
The best James Bond to date. Deserves its acclaim.,positive
"An absolute masterpiece. Daniel Craig is by far and away the best bond, I know, I know such blasphemy against Connery....Connery is a great Bond, but Craig is every thing Bond should be and its especially true for this Bond the ""origin"" story Bond.",positive
"Boasting impressive stunts, beautiful locations and strong direction, Martin Campbell's 2006 Bond reboot is glamorous, entertaining and wonderfully suspenseful. The film is overlong and narratively unimpressive, but its visuals are spectacular and Daniel Craig brings a lot more than just a new hair colour to Fleming's beloved character, offering an insight into 007's mind and motivations. Beneath all the in-your-face product placement and continuity errors lurks a rather appealing, respectable character study.",negative
"A good piece of entertainment, and a good update of the plot from the 1953 novel. However, Craig is written as some kind of a thuggish rogue and while Eva Green is nice casting, the character of Vesper is a total misfire in terms of writing and motive. Still, it's a huge improvement over the horrendous Pierce Brosnan years.",negative
"I really liked Daniel Craig as Bond. He brought a much darker, edgier element to the character, and his version felt much more realistic.",positive
Not big on James Bond,negative
"Sophisticated and endearing, Daniel Craig brings on a new era for James Bond.",positive
"Daniel Craig is a good James Bond replace,emrnt",positive
"The ballsiest make-over any saga has ever undergone, Casino Royale is a thrilling movie that took everyone by complete surprise and breathed new life into a then 40 year old saga that had grown narcissistic and repetitive. This uses previously skimped Ian Fleming elements, goes back to Bond's beginnings, his obtainment of Double ""O"" status and puts our flawed hero into a modern world. The real hero, however, is the amazing script; so tight that it squeaks, it's equal parts all-out-action, dramatic character study and knuckle-biting thriller. Campbell's steady camera work is as steady and high-polished as Bond himself, Craig fits the role like a well-tailored suit, and Eva Green is not-objectively the best Bond girl ever. Who knew a 007 movie could be this good?",positive
Great movie. Who knew that poker games could be so intense?,positive
"Casino Royale is the twenty-first film in the James Bond film series and the first to star Daniel Craig. The film also marks the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel which was previously produced as a 1954 television episode and a 1967 satirical film. Casino Royale reboots the series and starts off with a kind of origin story, at least the origin of how he got his licence to kill and became 007. The movie is filled with homages to the ones that came before it and just having seen every bond withen the space of a month i enjoyed picking them out and getting a little over excited especially when bond meets Felix Leiter. Craig is a very credible and tough Bond. Brutal and cold, like a killing machine, determined to get the job done but can turn on the charm if he needs to. Starting at the beginning of his double O career allows us to see a less experienced and more vulnerable Bond. He's much more reckless and gritty and realy pushes his mind and body to the limit. A change was needed from the cartoonish fantasies the Pierce Brosnan Bonds had become, and this is definately a step in the right direction With intense action, frenetic and well shot chase scenes particularly the ones on foot. Perfetly paced and utterly cool. Smartly written, stylishly directed and well acted. Great bond girl, if not one of the best and a great villian. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",positive
This is a good movie but the main problem with it is James Bond is supposed to be a fun movie not a kill everyone and torture people violent type of movie. 65/100,negative
"Daniel Craig steps into the role of James Bond and gives a good performance, and the movie around him is even better. Gritty, good action, a pre-title sequence that truly sets the tone, and an overall fun experience. Bond once again came off some big lows and bounced back with an even bigger high. I don't know how this series still manages to stay relevant after so many years, it could've died when Connery left, but somehow it survived, and after each setback and every moment it seems as if there is no way the series could continue (whether it be legal battles, or casting changes, or even the end of the cold war)...the series remains one of the strongest in cinema history, and ""Casino Royale"" is just another in a long line of refreshers that this series has had, and it is one of the best films featuring the famous secret agent.",positive
Dare I say this is the best Bond film ever made? Absolutely. Daniel Craig brings a Bond to the table that is no-holds-barred scrapper as well as a tortured soul. This film is chock full of intrigue and suspense instead ridiculous gadgets goofy villains that have plagued the series for years. Finally a Bond film that is as watchable as it is re-watchable. I will never get enough of this film.,positive
"Vesper Lynd: It doesn't bother you? Killing all those people? James Bond: Well I wouldn't be very good at my job if it did. ""A Whisper of Love. A Whisper of Hate."" So long since I've seen this.. Review soon",positive
One of my top 5 of movies all time. This is what Ian Flemming had in mind when he created JAmes Bond.,positive
"Casino Royale has good action here and then, good acting here and then, and a good script here and then. It's also a good movie, more here than then though. B",positive
One of the better Bond Movies Daniel Craig proves that he can be a good Bond,positive
The best Bond as it goes.... 5 Layer Cakes,positive
Stunning and electrifying! Daniel Craig is the best James bond since the original Sean Connery. Overflowing with style and suspense.,positive
"Craig kicks a$$ in every way a detached human hero should be. Inviting with it's emotions, awesome with the motions, and amazing altogether.",positive
"A pretty good movie, but i would prefer a less macho man to keep the legacy on...",negative
"Best bond movie to date, better in every possible way: that which it mimics from the originals it does better and with more class and that which it changes it does so sensibly and to the benefit of the film and it's franchise. More action films should take a leaf out it's book, because one of it's strongest points is it's versatility, I can watch this movie in any mood, over and over again.",positive
"At last we have another true Bond.. Sharp, sophisticated and as tough as nails... And perhaps correctly more shaken than stirred. Welcome back 007... Welcome back.",positive
"Suddenly James Bond isn't boring anymore although it's true, it is very much like the Bourne films in style. Only makes sense as a two part story with Quantum of Solace though.",positive
"I may get a lot of crap here, but i just don't like this movie, (respect the opinions of everyone who does, just want to state mine) Casino Royale (in my opinion) is just boring, the pacing is all over the place and i just didn't like it along with Quantum of Solace but i'll review that later. Now i will give the film this it is really well acted, i did like the tone, i didnt see any of the other 21 James Bond movies, this one to me just felt stale and dull, I haven't seen the movie in a couple of years who knows i might give it another chance one the matter, but when i watched it i just couldn't follow it.",negative
Really well done. Can really see the development of Bond. Great action.,positive
The best of the entire series by far! This was a brilliant restart to the series! Daniel Craig the best Bond since Sean Connery!,positive
Bond is back - and he delivers the definitive bond experience!,positive
"This is, without a doubt, one of, if not the best Bond movie yet. Daniel Craig plays what I imagine a true MI6 agent to be: ruthless and unforgiving. However he shows to be vulnerable as well, which only adds to the movies fantastic plot. Daniel Craig's performance puts him up past Sean Connery as the best Bond yet.",positive
The best james bond movie!!,positive
"Daniel Craig is definetely the best James Bond since Sean Connery! Martin Campbell present this great movie which rescues the Bond franchise from falling in the dislike and deliver a good espionage/action movie. Daniel Craig and Eva Green both did a great job. I recommend this to every action and espionage movie fans. Well, actually I recommend this to every cinema fan, because ""Casino Royale"" is such a awesome experience.",positive
What a great come back for Bond. Daniel Craig was definitely the right choice.,positive
"'Casino Royale' is a phenomenal Bond film, and a damn good film in its own right. With a great cast, particularly Daniel Craig as Bond, the films shines. An intense reboot of the Bond series; recommended.",positive
I never thought watching a poker game would be so suspenseful. Overall a great movie.,positive
Makes you forget there were ever any other actors that played Bond.,positive
"Actor Daniel Craig assumes the role formerly occupied by such screen greats as Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Timothy Dalton to set out on the character's very first 007 mission. James Bond has earned his ""00"" status by masterfully executing a pair of death-defying professional assassinations. Now assigned the task of traveling to Madagascar to spy on notorious terrorist Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) for his maiden voyage as a 007 agent, Bond boldly goes against MI6 policy to launch an independent investigation that finds him traversing the Bahamas in search of Mollaka's notoriously elusive terror cell. Subsequently led into the company of the mysterious Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian) and his exotic girlfriend, Solange (Caterina Murino), Bond soon realizes that he is closer than ever to locating well-guarded terrorist financier Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), the man who has personally bankrolled some of the most prevalent terrorist organizations on the planet. When Bond learns that Le Chiffre is planning to partake in an upcoming high-stakes poker game to be played at Montenegro's Le Casino Royale and use the winnings to establish his financial grip on the globe, M (Judi Dench) assigns beguiling agent Vesper (Eva Green) the task of watching over the fledgling agent as he plays against Le Chiffre in a covert attempt to destroy the nefarious gambler's well-established monetary stronghold in the underworld once and for all. Bond will need more than his legendary gambling skills in order to win this dangerous game, though, and after allying himself with local MI6 field agent Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and CIA operative Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), the endlessly suave super-spy puts on his poker face for a high-stakes game of cards in which the stakes are not measured in dollars, but human lives. Starring Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Giancarlo Giannini, Caterina Murino , Simon Abkarian , Isaach De Bankolé , Jesper Christensen , Ivana Milicevic and others. Directed by Martin Campbell who also directed GoldenEye, the 2 Zorro movies, Vertical Limit, Edge of Darkness and the recent Green Lantern. here comes the best Bond movie ever. i am gonna keep my review short. i have seen it before but i didn't completed it so few weeks back i saw the full movie and now i am reviewing it. Campbell directed GoldenEye before which was a nice movie but this was something i never expected from him or from anyone else. an excellent Bond Movie, a Bond movie worth giving 5 stars? that is shocking indeed. many of you have seen it but if not then it is a MUST WATCH. Daniel Craig's first movie as Bond, he did a fantastic job. i don't know about others but i find him so good as Bond and also he has great looks. he did a very good job and i loved his performance. Eva Green and Caterina Murino both looked good but isn't Eva Green like one of the best bond girls? Mads Mikkelson was a good villain. and obviously Judy Dench as M was good as always. Good Direction as well as very thrilling and edge of the seat plot. screenplay was excellently written. great Effects and action with great score and cinematography and other stuff. filled with good action fun. a pure adrenaline filled rush from start to finish. definitely one of the best movies. and my most favorite Bond movie.",positive
"There are just so many reasons I love this movie. To start Casino Royale brings bond back to being relevant. The 80's and 90's were not very good to this beloved character (except for Goldeneye). This whole thing comes down to the brilliant casting of Daniel Craig. Most people balked at the idea of having this blonde man play the famed secret agent. By the time everyone saw the movie however no one was questioning his talent. They discovered Craig and created one of the biggest movie stars around today. Martin Campbell (Goldeneye) brings this quasi-reboot to us in style. The movie is beautifully directed and has a great script. James Bond is truly one of films greatest characters, and thanks to Casino Royale, we're beginning to remember why.",positive
"I do miss some of the silliness of previous Bonds. This movie takes itself very seriously but it is a good film. I find Daniel Craig to be a little too emotionless and dull for me and some of the product placement was very obvious and sloppy. I know that is a small thing but how classy is it to be shoving Ford and Sony down my throat constantly. By the way, no other Bond would ever show up to a exclusive club in a fucking Ford Focus or whatever the hell he was driving.",positive
"Wow! Bond (Craig) is sent on a mission by ""M"" (Dench) to take down a corrupt financier (Mikkelsen) in a high stakes poker game involving the too-cool Vesper Lynd (Green) who James falls for. But when things get dangerous, James uses his strengths to beat evil for the 21st time. Back in 2006, this was a really risky movie to make. Pierce Brosnan had passed the torch to a new Bond after making 2002's ""Die Another Day"" with Halle Berry, but it was still unknown at the time who would fill the shoes, considering how much money Brosnan was bringing in for his studio. Once they finally chose Daniel Craig, they didn't know what would happen. Luckily, it was both a critical and a commericial success, and brought Daniel Craig a whole new kind of recognition. For me, this one was in the top five of my favorite Bond movies. While the others are unrealistic and silly with all of of the action sequences, this one seems almost real, and the loads of money used weren't used for dumb, uneeded gadgets that seem to plague all of the other films. This one is slick and sleek, and proves Daniel Craig can make it big in America and not just Britain. Eva Green is a sublime as well as very sexy Bond girl that doesn't just rely on looks to get James, but adds her wit and charm into the game. Though her doomed fate makes the film a little harsh, Green's entry into this brought a legend for the others to come. Judi Dench is one of the few in this film to reprise her role as the stylish ""M"". Look at the old Bond films-- she's so much cooler than the original man who made the character famous. I don't usually see this much in films from the 2000s, but not only the acting is good, but the cinematography is great as well. The camera angles keep that cool into the flick, and when you put that well-known music into it, you just know that this will be a new kind of Bond. ""Casino Royale"" is a great look into the James Bond franchise, and certainly stands today as being one of the best.",positive
"This is what a Bond movie is all about. It has great action sequences, exotic locations, beautiful girls and a suave spy. Beyond this it also has more heart than the entire series of Bond films combined. The story starts off at the beginning and as such allows us to see a side of James we had not visited before. We see the journey he goes through to become the super spy we all know so well. I can honestly say that this is my all time favourite Bond movie and despite perhaps being a little slow towards the end it will keep 99% of viewers glued to the screen throughout (many returning again and again) Score 95%",positive
Great film. Daniel Craig is excellent as Bond. Great action scenes and lots of twists at the end.,positive
"I admit I was hesitant because I love the ""cheese factor"" of the 007 series but this was a damn good movie. Its even the best-looking movie of the whole series. The standard opening chase through a construction site was really thrilling and a great change from the usual cars or boats. The stunt work on the fights was great too but it was almost worthless since the bad guys are so interchangeable. This is a personal complaint but it lost me in the middle with the poker-playing, only to zap my interest back just like Bond's heart. I kept wondering why Bond was not Bond but in the end, the pay-off answered all of my questions. Now I'm looking forward to more sequels with Daniel Craig.",positive
when this came out i was pretty tired of 007 movies...but then i saw this one,positive
"BOND, JAMES BOND!! I like the Bond movies!!!",positive
Quite a slow movie... :L But bond is a total Ace!,negative
Reminded us of what James Bond is *truly* about!,positive
Havent seen all the james bond movies but why is sean connery not still 007?,positive
More an pure action movie then a real James Bond movie according to me but a good one.,negative
This more breathtaking and brutally honest take on Bond is a fresh update on the classic spy genre as a whole. This film shows Bond in the flesh and makes him understandable and more relatable. Definitely one of the best Bonds and a film everyone can love even if there not into Agent 007,positive
the best action movie i have ever seen,positive
Fuck yeah this is what a Bond film is supposed to be,positive
"While Daniel Craig offers a likeable, promising performace as the new 007, 'Casino Royale' suffers a big let-down with its excessive violence.",negative
"I dunno, maybe I wasn't really in the mood and was just forcing myself to watch this movie we've been sitting on for like 2 months but, meh. I mean it was a solid action movie but I couldn't escape the ""been there, seen that"" feeling. Plus I think Pierce Brosnan was the perfect James Bond. And after just watching There Will Be Blood last weekend, well... That movie is just in a different league. Oh well...",negative
"The polar opposite of the focused, driven action movie - Casino Royale is a snappy, sharply written celebration of rip-roaring action and juicy dialogue. A film which takes over two hours but is paced refreshingly well, never tiring you out (contrast recent similar films of Chris Nolan, which are epic but can fatigue the viewer with their unrelenting intensity). Although the sequel is simpler in its appeal, it's quite clear after a couple viewings that Casino Royale is a vastly superior picture. However, Jason Bourne can still kick James Bond's ass any day of the week.",positive
James Bond finally gets some testosterone after he lost it in Die Another Day.,positive
"When Sean Connery left as James Bond the movies fell into a little bit of a slump, with the occasional good movie. Daniel Craig brings back the exhilirating feeling of watching James Bond films in Casino Royale.",positive
"It's great to finally see a James Bond that is more human, rather than superhuman. Daniel Craig's James Bond is more vulnerable and carries much more personality and emotion than previous Bond's. Aside from these characteristics, this is one of the best 007's ever made. The action, swagger, romance.......it's all there, and together they make one awesome film!",positive
"Eva Green thumbs up, Daniel Craig's James Bond... booooo!",negative
The best bond film ever. the action scenes are gritty and realistic. the plot is the best one yet. Daniel Craig is the one true James Bond. Watch this movie.,positive
"A flawless movie and might be the second best Bond movie after From Russia, With Love.",positive
Ini baru namanya film James Bond!,positive
Daniel Craig IS James Bond.,positive
"I must say that I never been a fan of the james bonds' movies, but Daniel Craig makes it so much fun to watch this film. Great stunts and great overall action even if sometimes you wonder how its humanly possible. But fcuk it! He's James Bond, he never dies.",positive
Very good movie! This movie was amazing! Great everything!,positive
"I like Daniel Craig's take on the Bond character--good casting and performance there. Early in the picture too there is the chase scene--set in a construction zone in Uganda--which is terrific. One of the best I've seen in or out of a Bond film. The grand finale shootout in Venice is disappointing though, sub-par for a Bond film. Excessively fast-cut, poorly filmed, downright confusing. That lowered the rating about a full star right there. Some minor additional notes: Caterina Murino is one of the less attractive ""Bond girls"" I've seen. Eva Green is just passable as Craig's co-star. Music director David Arnold's score is just serviceable. He enlisted former SoundGarden singer/songwriter Chris Cornell to create the important opening credits theme song, but that didn't work out well. Cornell may well have blown his chance to be the next Kenny Loggins.",negative
Awesome. Great Bond debut for Daniel Craig.,positive
"Casino Royale is an enjoyable movie in itself, but the treatment of the Bond character and franchise is simply perfect. The book of the same name is the first of the series, and is mainly character development, with little action that would translate well to screen. The film keeps the key element - Bond, Ian Fleming's Bond, at the card table - and adds some Broccoli-esque yet tasteful high-action.",positive
Dan Craig? Yeah nuff said,positive
"I've never been a fan of the Jason Bourne movies, and it's hard to exactly articulate why. The leads are fine, the action is good, the plot has plenty of twists and turns to keep you invested. There are villains, there are Big Ideas, there are car chases and foot chases and gun fights and fist fights and Brian Cox and good-looking women and even better-looking men and just about everything that you could possibly want in a decent action movie and yet it just leaves me completely cold. I can't get invested. I can only half-pay attention. They're boring, and I don't care. And I don't exactly know why. I suppose the best I can come up with is that it's not more like ""Casino Royale."" ""Casino Royale"" is Daniel Craig's first outing as super spy and sex symbol James Bond, and what a way to kick the whole thing off. Although by no means a masterpiece (and only six years later ""Skyfall"" would come around to blow it out of the water), the film is still a marvel and a load of fun to watch. Which is funny, seeing as how the filmmakers clearly wanted to make ""James Bond as Jason Bourne"". So why does this one work while Bourne doesn't? I think part of it is that James Bond is a more compelling character than Bourne is. At the time of this film's release, Bond had forty-four years of cinematic history (and nine years more in books). That's a lot of time to develop a character and, as such, a lot more wiggle room to reinvent him. Jason Bourne may have been twenty-two when his film was made, but he wasn't as rich of a tradition. As such, Bourne was first finding his steps, walking ahead tentatively, while the new Bond stepped boldly forth into the daylight. And it works. Both characters are clearly human (although the way they both break through glass with nary a scratch on them is beyond me), far from infallible and they both have a sensitive side. And both are damaged. But there's a key difference, I think, that puts the edge in Bond's corner: Bourne's damage has to do with his lack of memory and the absence of his past; Bond's damage comes from his past. Although it's not explicit like it is in ""Skyfall"", Bond is clearly dealing with some ghosts and trauma from his childhood. It makes him cold on the outside, but there's clearly something lying underneath that can be damaged. I think the long tradition in cinema also gives Bond a leg up with his relationship with the love interest- I don't know how Bourne was with women, so it just seems like he's latching on to the first woman he meets. But when Bond connects with Vesper (Eva Green), it's the first time in a long time that Bond has had real emotional connection with a woman. Vesper is also a better character, less a damsel-in-distress and more of an agent out of her element. Yes, she has trouble dealing with all the death and violence, but she works for the Treasury. It makes sense why Bond would love a woman like her; she's basically Bond, but with a little more humanity. The villain here is also better. Many people have accused Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) as a bit of a bore, and I guess there's an element of truth to that, but I don't know. It's a bold new direction for a new Bond, and I like the fact that he's not a mastermind- he's just a man good with numbers. It's an effective performance of a bad man who's ultimately in way over his head. Also, he CRIES BLOOD. The action, though inspired by Bourne, is better here too. Yes, there's some shaky cam here and there, but ultimately the violence is a lot easier to follow. And although it's rooted in reality, the film isn't afraid to go a little out there with its set pieces, especially with a jaw-dropping chase scene that serves as its post-credits Cold Open. And that's another thing- this film has set pieces. I have no problem with an action film not being nonstop action; in fact it's probably a better idea. I mean, ""Die Hard"" and ""Dredd"" are great, but most movies simply can't pull off what they manage to do. Character development is a good idea. But if you're not going to have a straight up action film, you need set pieces. Less action, but more imagination and energy in the action you gives us. The Bourne series doesn't have set pieces, just average fights. ""Casino Royale"" has set pieces. So yeah, I think I've demonstrated why this movie is considerably better than Bourne. But why 100%? All the elements above are fine and all, but does it merit five stars? Ultimately, no, but the film has another ace up its sleeve- its plot is wholly different from what you'd expect in an action movie. You'll never see another espionage thriller whose main source of tension comes from a high-stakes poker game. Well, until someone else comes along and adapts ""Casino Royale"" again. It'll happen. One day. But I digress. The plot, which I've not even begun to discuss, is basically this: Bond competes in the poker game (changed from the novel's baccarat) to prevent a group of international terrorists from winning the money, and forcing Le Chiffre to cooperate. Also worth noting is the opening credits, which are some of the best opening credits of all time. Complete with a badass song, it's a great way to kick off the film. If you haven't seen it, please do. You won't regret it.",positive
My Name is Bond James Bond. With a new bond we get a new feel for the classic hero. I enjoyed this movie a whole lot. The parkor scene at the beginning was worth the price of admission lol. However there were not enough Bond Quips...,positive
"Daniel Craig injects new life into a mundane franchise by giving us a Bond that is much more grounded in reality than in past films, and Martin Campbell's direction gives the film a more intense feel.",positive
"Casino Royale is possibly the best James Bond film I've seen. In all honesty, I really liked Quantum of Solace; but in terms of depth, Casino outweighs it by far. Amazing performance by Daniel Craig (my favorite Bond), realistic and thrilling action, and an intelligent script makes this a great film and a total revival of the franchise.",positive
"Meh, this James Bond bleeds too much...",negative
"I liked it but I wasn't crazy about it. Then again, I did watch it online in awful quality.",positive
"After Brosnan's legacy, I couldn't believe Daniel Craig's ""Ultra-Hombre"" attitude could fit in the Bond character. But this movie proved very wrong to my expectations and made a great (maybe one of the best) James Bond movie.",positive
"Totally love the new Bond, he has a way better look and attitude. He doesn't lose the style and charm. I can finally say Bond has feelings. This has been the best Bond movie in decades. Even though it is sad what happends with his love story, he still finishes the movie strong, with his classic saying ""The name is Bond, James Bond."" You can see this movie hundreds of times, and you still get the chills every time.",positive
Best Bond movie ever and best Bond as well...,positive
"This film is very interesting. I honestly wasn't expecting a whole lot, and when I thought the film was about to end, the biggest twists kicked in.",positive
"With enough badassitude equal to eight seasons of 24, this is one flick I can never tire of. Daniel Craig rubbishes all critics who thought he couldn't do Bond by bring more humour (dry and acerbic - British style), more chops (the fight scene with the Ugandan was epic), less gadgetry, plenty of hot women (who are strong characters on their own), and not one but TWO aston martins! Too many good things going on with this film that I can't spend any more time writing about it, off to watch it once more.",positive
Best bond movie ever. Amazing.,positive
Danel Craig makes an awesome Bond!,positive
"Daniel Craig is great as Bond. Let me be clear on that. The worst part of this film is that they chose to have much of the film to revolve around a poker game. The middle section of Casino Royale drags. It is just not exciting to watch people play Poker. Maybe it's just because I don't know how to play it. The action sequences are very clever and memorable. Part of this is because the director recognizes that car chases can become tedious and pointless. I believe the car chase as an action vehicle is generally devoid of excitement. I think it's because I get the feeling that most car chases didn't have to happen to move the plot forward. Even ""Drive"" which has a car-centric verb in the title only has two car related action sequences (that happen to both be very unique and brief). We also see Bond's human side. Sometimes Hollywood culture has become so obsessed with creating such an impossibly sexy and cool character that the character, in reality, becomes a robot (albeit a one that can't control their libido around the sexy women that throw themselves at the protagonist). Craig's Bond doesn't flaunt his coolness. He just is. He's part of a movement that celebrates the quiet badass reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's effortless charisma on the screen. This 007 is efficient, cold blooded, and brutal; yet he loves. He also almost dies from very mundane things (i.e. not an explosion) like being poisoned or almost having his baby makers snipped off prematurely. Unfortunately, Bond's emotional arc is not the center of the movie. His character is shown to be layered but the film still gets too caught up in its somewhat convoluted plot. Plus the blood dripping from the main villain's eye was kind of stupid and weird. But that's a much more petty complaint.",negative
Daniel Craig puts a new spin on Bond that doesn't revolve around his trademark gadgets to get the job done while still keeping the suave 007 style.,positive
"A down right, Ultimately Fantastic reboot to the Bond Franchise. Following it to the core of what we fans hoped for in a Bond franchise,Brutal, dark, and very very intense, Daniel Craig plays the role of bond to a sheer perfection. Well done Martin Campbell well done",positive
A marvelous reinvention of the Bond franchice. Daniel Craig is easily the most memorable 007 since Sean Connery.,positive
As a die hard Bond fan who waited expectantly and hopefully for a very long time there was nothing in this move that let me down. It worked on every level and reignited Bond for a new generation.,positive
"I have never been a fan of the 007 franchise until I saw Daniel Craig own his screen time, portraying James Bond shouldn't be hard after Brosnan left; Being an all around actor than the previous he steps up and creates a raw, brutal human that bond has hid behind for so long was refreshing.",positive
"Portraying Bond and Vesper as human - flaws and all, was the best decision made in the entire Bond Franchise.",positive
The best Bond ever. Chill with that Skyfall talk.,positive
Good Ol' mr. Craig doesn't disappoint what Bond fans truly desire.,positive
Very good movie. My heart was pumping the entire time. Daniel Craig proves himself to be a cold blooded James Bond and I think that suits him well.,positive
"Craig is great. Very man's man without being offensive. And a gentleman. And a crazed killer. And he can get hurt, which was a weakness in the Bond stories. His bitterness and loss and betrayals are very real.",positive
Re-watched this before seeing Quantom of Solace which picks up when Casino Royale ends. It has all the ingredients of the Bond formula but with a Bond portrayal that is back to that intended in the novels. A little long but action-packed. And Daniel Craig was great eye-candy.,negative
"Not a bad introduction to the new Bond. Typical Bond trappings - beautiful women, fast cars, high-tech gadgets - and a new Bond make you feel like you are watching a 007 movie. Turns out you are really watching World Poker Tour, but instead of the announcers speaking in hushed tones you get some gritty, violent behind the scenes footage. Choreography in the fight scenes is spectacular, the acting is pretty good, production values are high, special effects are special. This movie is worth your time, however it was about 20 minutes too long. It should have ended when the main story was over; it felt like the last 20 minutes was added on as an afterthought. The overall effect of the movie suffers for it. You wrote this on 7/5/09.",negative
"Martin Campbell returns to once again revive a varied yet noble Bond franchise back to it's height of greatness. Daniel Craig is every bit as great a bond as the rest, offering the most real 007 of the whole series. All the bad guys pose real threat, with Mads Mikklesen's Le Chiffre coming across as formidable without ever having to enter the fight himself. Casino Royale is everything a Bond film should be, and everything it never thought it could be.",positive
the best bond since the connery days,positive
"Kinda miss Pierce Brosnan's class and more use of gadgets, but Daniel Craig can surely kick some ass, literally.",negative
My favourite bond movie,positive
"Surprisingly good. Strips away all the gadgets in favor of pure, clean action.",positive
"The best scene {SPOILER] is of course when he gets poisoned at the poker table, stumbles out to the car to defibrillate himself with the portable defibrillation kit, and then strides back in to win the game.",negative
"Casino Royale is a masterpiece of a bond film and one of the best, if not the best, movies in the series. Casino Royale reenergizes the bond franchise after the medicore Die Another Day and a lackluster World is Not Enough. The movie gives a more realistic approach to the bond character the same way Christopher Nolan did to the batman franchise. Not just this, but we are given a great plot to complement it and some awesome action sequences. An amazing opening for Daniel Craig as the new James Bond, he has really come a long way from a majorly expected disappointment to being considered by many, including me, to be the best bond of them all.",positive
My favourate of them all so far.,positive
Can't be perfected more.,positive
Introduction of Daniel Craig as Bond.....and possibly the best foot chase scene...ever,positive
Great Reboot - loved it,positive
Bond is a must and this is one of the best movie of the series...,positive
"I'm a big fan of James Bond. I've seen all the movies at least four times, even the ones which are a bit cheesy (thank you Roger Moore). But Casino Royale....damn, now that's what I call an awesome movie ! We follow James Bond in his first big mission, in which he has to deal with a terrorists banker called Le Chiffre. The villain uses terrorists' money to short-sell stock in successful companies. By avoiding a plane explosion in Miami Airport, Bond makes Le Chiffre losing a huge amount of money, so his enemy has to organize a Texas hold 'em tournament in Montenegro to recoup his (or I should say terrorists) funds. When the waiter asks Bond either he wants his Vodka Martini shaken or stirred, Bond's reply is ""do I look like a give a damn ?"". Because this new Bond is agressive, nervous, violent, in a word : human. He is fragile, physically and mentally, he can bleed, he can be defeated, he can fall in love, just the opposite of his predecessors, and that's for the best. If Sean Conney will always stay THE James Bond, the original, the one and only, I think Daniel Craig is close to a perfect Bond. Eva Green is surely the most interesting James Bond Girl in history, with all the mystery around her, and the way she subdues Bond. And what to say about Mads Mikkelsen ? That we hadn't seen a bad guy like him in the saga since Christopher Walken's character Max Zorin in A View To A Kill ? Yep, something like that, because Le Chiffre is an awesome villain, different, more human too, but still really dangerous, and really crazy (man, that torture sequence !!). The action scenes are incredible, it made me think of the ones in the Jason Bourne saga, which clearly shadowed the Bond license this last decade. But it's only past now, Bond is back, and he's really really nervous ! You want me to find something wrong in this film ? Well....maybe... the fact that we had to wait until the 21st episode to watch such a masterpiece ? Well yeah, you can call this a weak point, if you want... P.S. : Soundtrack's awesome too ;)",positive

"Bond gets rebooted, Craig is quite good but nowhere near as good as its made out to be.",negative
Casino Royale was an amazing movie and by far my favorite. It's too early to tell but Daniel Craig may be the best Bond yet. Eva Green deserves credit as well. She was a cool bond girl and made me want to be Bond even more. The new realistic fighting seens are a welcome getaway from the fake coreography in previous bond films. This movie is to the point and worth your time and money. I can not wait for the new upcoming bond Quantum of Solace.,positive
"This is not Bond, James Bond. Still a good movie though.",positive
"In his first mission, James Bond must stop Le Chiffre, a banker to the world's terrorist organizations, from winning a high-stakes poker tournament at Casino Royale in Montenegro.",positive
"Everybody I know only thought this movie was okay, but I really liked it!!",positive
"First bond movie that I ever saw. No matter an others I might see, this is the best.",positive
If it isn't a remake it's a reboot & everyone's favorite secret agent gets the new century treatment w/ mixed results. Daniel Craig's Bond is a lot more physical & takes quite the beating (especially to the nut sack). He even needs to be defibrated @ one point. It sure made me miss Bond of old but this flix will grow on you if you give into it & don't compare it too much to some of the greats. Since this is an update no longer are they playing baccarat @ the casino but rather Texas hold em. The problem is the card game isn't very interesting. There's better games on Sports Net or even if you were going to play yourself on line. Quentin Tarantino was once attracted to this project it would have been interesting to see what he came up w/. I don't know if it would have been any better in this day & age but I have a feeling it would have been alot different. That's probably why he got nixed from the project,negative
Bond Bitches!! haha!,positive
"The first gritty Bond. Take it or leave it, I guess. Given the chauvinist asshole aura I got from Daniel Craig, I fall into the latter. However, ignoring that, it is one of the more visually astute films in the James Bond franchise.",negative
love james bond a fantastic movie,positive
finally! v get a well matured bond flick! craig is bang on target from the first frame!,positive
"One of the best bond movies ever, great reboot",positive
"I don't care what people say. I liked the watches that cut through steel with lasers. The quippy lines. And the cliche escapes from golden eye and such. Regardless, an excellent movie. I enjoyed every minuet of it.",positive
"Awesome movie, it shows who James Bond should truly be in respect to Ian Fleming's 007 character. The movie is the best representation to Ian Fleming's book Casino Royale.",positive
"This new invention of the Bond films turned out to be a fun, dark, crazy, & action-packed movie. They also chose the perfect actor to play the new Bond, Daniel Craig. The new blonde Bond plays a darker, & more mysterious Bond then the others. Casino Royale is just so much richer than the previous 20 Bond movies, & it has an atmosphere to it that a Bond film should have. The storyline of Casino Royale is that it's Bond's first mission, he travels to Montenegro to stop a banker to the world's terrorist organizations from winning a poker tournament. I thought that the characters were all just so great, & the actors were awesome. Overall it turns out to be an awesome addition to the Bond series. It stars...Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Judi Dench, Jeffery Wright, etc.",positive
"Casino Royale is a reboot to the Bond film series, which intended to show a Bond in the beginning of his 007 career. And it works. Gone are the silly gadgets of the last few bond movies. And there's especially Daniel Craig who gives us a great portrayal of James Bond. His is gritty and by far my favorite Bond. Eva Green shines on screen as the Bond girl and Mads Mikkelsen is great as the villain. So a great movie and my favorite Bond film. Thank you for reading.",positive
"I think its the best bond movie. I never wanted to see any other Bond, Except Pierce Brosnan. But after this movie, I NOW dnt wanna see any other bond but Daniel Craig.",positive
"""Casino Royale"" is the story of, MI6 agent, James Bond's (Daniel Craig) first mission. Fresh off of receiving the coveted ""007"" status, Bond begins the long and elaborate task of bankrupting the world's top terrorist financier, Le Chiffre (Mikkelson). Now, I am, proudly, a James Bond fan myself and when I had heard that they were going to reboot the franchise ala ""Batman Begins""; I was elated. Because honestly the last few Bond films have been something off a showcase of silliness. After watching ""Casino Royale"" I can safely say that this film effectively restores the Bond film series, as well as the James Bond name, to everything that author Ian Fleming had originally intended. This film features one of the most dynamic portrayals of the character I've ever seen on film. Sure, everything from the previous films is there (the charm, wit, etc.), but Actor Daniel Craig brings some aspects to the character I've never seen before. He does a really profound job at accentuating just how much of a cold bastard 007 really is. Though he also does a good job at depicting the more loving side of Bond -like I said. . .dynamic. With all these different shades of Bond in tow, Craig creates, quite possibly, my favorite representation of the character. Eva Green does a fine job in her role as the beguiling treasury agent, Vesper Lynd. Green and Craig construct a deep kind of chemistry that I have yet to see any other Bond and ""Bond-girl"" develop on film. Also, cheers to Mads Mikkelson for playing one of the creepiest Bond-villains I've ever seen. In terms of technicalities, The camerawork is very clean, and editing is logical and accurate. The soundtrack utilizes the classic Bond Theme, but it also employs some extra nuances that I found to be quite suitable for the overall tone of the film. The screenplay is very well written, giving Bond some of the funniest lines I've ever heard his character say. The action is there too, as this movie features some of the coolest and most intimidating set pieces I've seen on film. I mean like some real ""Uncharted-esque"" stuff happens in this movie- pretty awesome. Anyways, I sincerely enjoyed ""Casino Royale"", for it re-establishes the James Bond franchise in a place that I feel is very fresh and provocative.",positive
pretty good (except for the 5 min or so of torture that I couldn't watch or listen to),positive

"A smart, serious and intense film that shocases Bond like the true spy he has to be.",positive
"As a rookie to James Bond films, I had no idea what to expect from them, so I decided to start with the reboot, Casino Royale. Since I haven't particularly been a fan of spy movies like the Bourne films, I was worried that it would be a waste of my time. Thankfully, veteran director Martin Campbell crafted a taut, deep, and action-packed spy thriller featuring a career-defining performance from Daniel Craig. While some may criticize Craig for not fitting the Bond profile of tall, dark, and handsome, he certainly brings a sense of complete and total badass to the proceedings. Bond is suave, clever, sneaky, and oddly sympathetic, creating a deeper character than I ever could have expected. Eva Green's Vesper Lynd is the source of his sympathy, giving him a focal point to latch onto besides killing. Her eventual downfall is what makes Bond the man he is, and Green fills her with a sense of sexiness and danger. Mads Mikkelsen certainly fits the ""devious villain"" profile, with his creepy scar and bleeding eye and general air of evil. Giancarlo Giannini plays a similar role to his Hannibal character as a corrupt agent, and Jeffrey Wright shows up to fulfill the ""outside ally"" role. Judi Dench, however, steals every scene she is in as M, Bond's boss and something of a mother figure to him. The action is good and skillfully choreographed, and the card game scenes are dripping with tension. I'm no fan of spy films, but Casino Royale may convert me yet.",positive
"Are you looking for a gritty, rule-free spy action thriller? Then Casino Royale is the movie for you. However, giving it the title of James Bond is just wrong. In no way does this revamp of the classic franchise revisit any of the fun, creative, and campy feel of its excessive number of predecessors, often for better, yet somewhat for worse. This drastic change in the way Martin Campbell portrays the reborn, seductive 007 agent causes many to turn their heads in the other direction, however an entirely new direction for James Bond, at this point, isn't a terrible idea (see Die Another Day). Casino Royale ends up spinning off in a direction that no one ever saw coming. James Bond, in the past, had always been known for his top of the line gadgetry, action sequences with no probable chance of survival, and, of course, cheesy pick-up lines that would somehow always catch Bond's victims off-guard and wind him up as a very lucky man on a number of improbable occasions. With Casino Royale, Martin Campbell brings James Bond back down to Earth, and does a very good job in doing so. The plot is nearly spotless, the action is based off of pure adrenaline and edge, and one could not ask for a better actor to take on the revitalized, grim role of James Bond himself. For once, the James Bond franchise attempts to incorporate a plausible story into its action along with a masterfully-compiled plot for the material and a string of events that can pull itself along into more than a single film. Even if Casino Royale does nothing else for you, you're at least bound to be grabbing at the edge of your seat for most of the movie as you bear in anticipation for what is to happen next as each scene moves from action to even more action. Campbell definitely has the new Bond formula down, but the question is whether or not he can maintain it. The biggest downside of this new formula, however, if it has not already been made clear enough, is that those die-hard fans out there who find themselves tied to the old James Bond antics will find themselves with a void in which Royale can not even begin to fill. Either way, this film is not to be missed.",positive
"Anyone who dislikes this film (yet likes Die Anther Day or Licence to Kill is good) wouldn't know quality if it bit them in their arse, FACT!",positive
"What I've always wanted, a completely badass Bond. Highly entertaining and quite funny in a couple of places.",positive
"If you have seen CASINO ROYALE, I'll refresh your memory a little by saying there is a fantastic take on the classic gun barrel sequence used in all James Bond films (well, except for QUANTUM OF SOLACE, kind of). If you have not seen it, first of all, I pity you, and second of all, let's just say the gun barrel sequence has been officially fit into the plot. To keep it plain, simple, and within five one-syllable words: Craig is the best Bond. Dare I explain? I guess so: all the other Bonds are so unlike Daniel Craig is in CASINO ROYALE: Sean Connery is always smiling whenever he has a close-up shot or a profile image; it's so difficult and even ironic to imagine both George Lazenby and Timothy Dalton holding a Walther PPK (or, let's face it, ANY gun); Roger Moore has puppy eyes that make it look like a cute little chihuahua gunning down tons of people; and Pierce Brosnan just looks incredibly harmless and good-looking. So that leaves us to conclude that Daniel Craig isn't too good-looking (but he still has three Bond girls in just this installment), AND he actually comes across to us, the audience, as a trigger-fingered, killing spy who can actually wield a Walther PPK without hearing comments like, ""Love your smile"", ""Umm...that's you?...holding a gun in front of my face?"", ""Aww...look at the cute little puppy with human features everywhere but his face..."", or even ""Bond? James Bond? You can't be serious; you can't kill me without feeling an overload of regret!"" Another thing to add is that this film is where you'll find the best, sexiest, well-acted Bond girls. All three of them--Vesper Lynd, Solange, and Valenka--are portrayed by little-known actresses, but they were all casted in exceptionally great Bond girl roles. That said, CASINO ROYALE is probably the best Bond film (maybe behind 1973's LIVE AND LET DIE): it's got the most individual take on the classic barrel roll sequence, it's got the best Bond actor, it's got the hottest Bond girls...it's got it all.",positive
"A refreshing look at the 007 character. The first half of this film is fantastic with an amazing opening sequence and action-packed chase scene. Once the casino scene is over, however, the movie takes a reluctant nose dive. Although James and Vesper spar well, their love affair isnâ(TM)t particularly convincing. The film could have stood well without the development of this added dimension. Why ruin a great action flick with forced romance? Nonetheless, the action sequences hold the movie together to the end.",positive
"Way, way too long and dragged on quite a bit but I really enjoyed it. Daniel Craig makes an excellent 'Bond' and a sexy one at that! When he is coming out of the water....drool. Serious hotness! 'The Bond Girl' really impressed me with her performance and surprisingly it's the first 'Bond' film I've watched and can say that I really enjoyed.",negative
So far so good. But there are fewer fancy stuff than before.,positive
"Casino Royale is a marriage of the dark tone from the James Bond novels and the thrilling action sequences we've come to expect from the films. Daniel Craig gives a nuanced performance as Bond bringing a quality that has been missing from the character for years-- humanity. Eva Green is fantastic as Vesper Lynd, the first Bond girl that is truly Bond's equal and the only to touch his cold heart. Mads Mikkelsen gives an appropriately menacing performance despite not having much to do; his character Le Chiffre is a bit forgettable compared to some of the Bond villains from the past. Despite that nit pick Casino Royale delivers exotic locations, beautiful women, and spectacular explosions, yet the story is never lost in the noise. Martin Campbell delivers not only the greatest Bond film of all time, but one of the greatest action films of all time.",positive
"The best Bond - a cold, blunt instrument. Bond returns in glorious style.",positive
"I was never a huge Pierce Brosnan fan, Daniel Craig brought fresh life back into an ancient series in a huge way.",positive

Not as good as Quantum of Solace. But still very good.,positive
This is the pentacle of filmmaking and Bond at his early and beautiful raw fury.,positive
"Absolutely fantastic, Casino Royale is epic and action packed. More akin to the Bourne franchise than the cheesy older Bond films.",positive
"Personal Score: 10/10 Before this film released in 2006, I wasn't what you'd call an avid James Bond fan. I had seen a few Bond films that I liked, some that I didn't, and only one that I loved (Goldeneye), so as far as I was concerned this was just another one that I may or may not get around to. I knew about the switch from the aging Pierce Brosnan to the younger and more intense Daniel Craig, and thought that this was a smart switch (anyone who'd seen his Bond-like appearance in the film Layer Cake may agree with me), but that wasn't enough to get me excited. It was perhaps a year after the film's release that I finally got around to seeing it, and from the opening scene, it was clear that this wasn't your average 007 film. This Bond was fierce, dangerous, violent, cold. People have said that this transformation was a sort of answer to the Jason Bourne films, and perhaps that is fair. That being said, this is a better film than each of the three Bourne films, and Daniel Craig's James Bond seems far more deadly. The film opens with Bond gaining his Double-0 status, which is another way of saying that it begins with him killing two people. After this we catch up some time later with Bond and another British intelligence agent tracking a bomb-maker in Madagascar. This sets up an amazing chase sequence, but by car like we're used to seeing, but rather on foot. This particular bomb-maker is a student of parkour, which is the martial art of one being able to get past any obstacle. Bond is obviously not into that, but he has athletic faculties of his own and some more practical ways of getting to this man (which includes running directly through a wall). Obviously he catches up to the man, at an embassy no less, and rather than take him in for questioning he kills him. A bit of a reckless decision, and certainly enough to royally piss off M (Judi Dench, better than ever). What Bond and company are attempting to do here is find out how certain terrorist groups are being funded. Eventually, Bond manages to track this bomb-maker to a sort of banker for the terrorists named Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre is a mathematical genius who shows this off by playing card games and the like but makes his living by betting his client's money on the stock market. Bond discovers a plan by Le Chiffre to blow up a new model of airplane which will cause the plane's company to fall into near-bankruptcy, which is exactly what Le Chiffre is betting on. Bond thwarts this plan, and Le Chiffre loses over $100 million. After this awful loss, Le Chiffre is well aware that his clients will soon learn of their money being gone, so he sets up a high-scale poker game at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. The possible winnings are $150 million, more than enough for Le Chiffre to pay back his clients, and obviously a bit more for a rainy day I suppose. M, however, decides to buy Bond into the game, and if he wins then Le Chiffre has nowhere to run and the British government can offer him sanctuary in exchange for his knowledge of terrorist funding. The money to get Bond into this game is handled by a lovely lady named Vesper Lynd (Eva Green). I doubt I need to tell you that this is to be Bond's love interest, but I will all the same because unlike the other Bond films, this is a genuine love interest for our hero. Bond has always been portrayed as the suave, charming, lady-killer who gets some girl who's forgotten by the next movie, as if she never existed. Here it's different. Bond is shown, at first, to treat women as disposable pleasures. He prefers women who are involved with someone else, which allows him to have no attachment to them. But when he meets Vesper, he meets a women who isn't taken in like other women, though she isn't immune to him either. The relationship between Bond and Vesper, and the way it grows during the course of the film, is the heart of Casino Royale, and the fact that a Bond film can be said to have a heart is pretty remarkable. These two aren't together for mere sexual escapades like other Bonds and Bond girls, they genuinely fall in love. Casino Royale contains quite a bit of depth for such a film. It isn't merely a great 007 movie, this is one of the best action films I've ever had the pleasure of watching. It's a bit complex, and may require two or three viewings to grasp the fullness of the story, but even before that happens this is a thrilling film with tremendous action, a fun-to-watch poker match, and a truly romantic love story. And for all of the Bond purists out there, there's also the beautiful women, gorgeous locales, and the vodka martini. Only Bond doesn't give a damn if it's shaken or stirred.",positive
"Daniel Craig pouts too much as Bond. It's like he's in Zoolander the entire time. It takes away the original tone of Bond movies. But of course, you can't escape a James Bond movie; after all, it is Bond, James Bond.",negative
"Some pretty good action with a mildly interesting storyline. Acting is decent. it;s pretty well shot and does a pretty good job of drawing in the viewer. Any fan of action will love it, if your into the sort of thing that's cool, but I'm not.",negative
"James Bond needed a reboot after most of the older entries got so silly it wasn't even fun anymore and the plot never changed, But this stunning film is brilliantly done by Daniel Craig who plays Bond perfectly, Some very good and brutal action scenes, And the best opening scene in a Bond film ever, It was nice to see that the gadgets are all but gone which made other Bond films silly, Bond doesn't have silly one liners he's just a heartless killer with a don't give a shit attitude just what Bond should be, It has to be the perfect Bond film, Very clever and the plot was very good if you can keep up with all the twists and turns, I hope Daniel Craig plays Bond for a long long time.",positive
Craig delivers a deeply human performance in what I think is the best Bond yet. Bond's storyline as tortured-orphan-turned-00-agent is a haunting and exciting reboot for the franchise. Royale is the best of the series as it is satisfying on more than just a visual level.,positive
this bond movie was the best since goldeneye nd goldfinger,positive
Thought it was a pretty decent movie with some short actions scenes and good acting.overall decent movie,negative
"Every time I see this movie, I have a greater appreciation for it.",positive
"one of the best Bond films ever if not the best, and Mr Craig is as good or slightly better than any Bond i can even think of",negative
"Ian Flemming's actual Bond... From Connery to Brosnan, there has been one constant; They didn't look like the written Bond. 007 was never intended a pretty boy handsome spy, but on film he translated to it. Enter Daniel Craig: I'm not saying he's not a handsome man, but he is closer to the more realistic Bond Flemming wrote 50 years ago. His gritty and not so smooth features are closer to the Hoagy 'Stardust' Carmichael the face was based upon. Add in the original Bond novel, and yes, we have a movie. Now, most of the Bonds reach near epic proportion, more than just a popcorn movie often does... this follows those footsteps. Exotic locations, little gadgetry and more roughhouse, this follows the ideals of 'Dr. No' and 'From Russia...' than let's say 'Die Another Day'. Yes, Judy Dench as M throws the timeline way out of whack for actual Bond-o-philes, but even the producers admitted they couldn't recast the role any better, so tough. Craig enters the role at just the right time, a little known face in the U.S., with several international roles, he is definately fresh and hits home with the brooding and broken Bond, who we've seen glimpses of in established Bonds before him. Is he the best 007? Far too soon to tell. But he's off to one damn fine start.",positive
"Royale is a perfectly executed and engaging reboot to the Bond franchise, giving a new look to the iconic hero that connects well with modern audiences. No imitation of the suave coolness of Connery, or the witty depth of Moore, Craig finally gives us what the franchise truly was lacking, a kickass Bond. Following in the vein of the fast-paced Bourne movies Royale injects a more modern and realistic, albiet explosive, take on one of the world's most memorable heroes.",positive
"The movie not only updates Bond, but takes his story to present day. The spy from 60 years ago is now brought firmly within the new millennium with cell phones, laptops, satellite surveillance and a plot revolving around the funding of terrorism. The films shows Blu-ray discs used to backup video surveillance at a security office, along with Ericsson phones and VAIO computers. At times, it seems like an extended Sony ad, but Sony's product placements are all in the flow of the story. Bond is simultaneously revved up with dizzying foot chases and brutal hand-to-hand combat scenes while being stripped down, with none of the gadgets, fancy torture devices or silly frills of the earlier films. After the credits roll, the opening chase scene featuring free-runner Sebastien Foucan, playing a bomb-maker, is hands-down the most ballsy, physically demanding action sequence in any 007 feature. One might expect the rest of the movie to be a letdown after that, but it isn't. The airport chase scene and brutal adventures in Venice, Italy prove every bit as riveting, while the epic scenes and vistas in the Bahamas and Montenegro are as gorgeous as any earlier James Bond film, and the psychology behind the card games make for good spectator sport. Even the villain of Casino Royale is better than the pretentious bad-guys from previous Bond movies. Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) is sinister by virtue of his business securing terrorist funds, his bleeding eye, cool demeanor and gambling skills. When it comes time for the showdown between Le Chiffre and Bond, Casino Royale does away with boring car chases, boat chases, plane chases, elaborate schemes and other frills that go nowhere and focuses instead on a stark torture scene that delivers insight into the characters. Casino Royale reboots James Bond into a thick plot of terrorist brokerage crime, high-stakes gambling and of course, brutality and loyalty. His relationship with Vesper Lynd shows him to be capable of love, but fundamentally distrustful of anyone - and that probably includes his own boss, M (Judy Dench). The new brand of violence and less sociable psychology of Bond highlight a welcome change. Previous incarnations of 007 were at their best when they emulated the wit and charm that made Sean Connery's Bond so popular. But he was not the scrappy, blue eyed Bond from Ian Fleming's spy thrillers. Daniel Craig is - or at least he comes far closer than any previous actor. And the virtual absence of any silly gadgets, contraptions, overelaborate torture schemes, tired car chases and other formulaic Bond fare make Casino Royale appear fresh and new. It retains moments of humor and levity, but overall has a darker, more serious aura.",positive
The best Bond film to date! Daniel Craig proves to be not only capable of playing the role of Bond but at the same time being the best Bond to date!,positive
"In less than two hours in a half, Daniel Craig show a new face for Bond saga, a fresh start for a vulnerable and vengeful plot, something never seen on 007 movies. Brutal and entertaiment action scenes with something more than a invencible english secret agent and a bunch of bimbos.",positive
"A darker, grittier Bond that works very well...",positive
"Any doubts previously held about Daniel Craig as Bond can officially be thrown out. Craig shines in this reboot, looking and acting the part of the world's greatest spy. The movie offers sharp plot turns, picturesque locations, a world-class chase scene just minutes in and a number of great action-packed moments.",positive
Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!!!,positive
"After a few viewings, I think I finally get the theme of the film, and its quite nice.",positive
"One of the greatest movies ever made, and the best one in the james bond film series.the performance of daniel craig makes it even more fantastic",positive
It is one of the best James Bond movies.,positive
"I wasn't ever a Bond fan but slowly I'm warming up to the films. This one is currently my favorite. It has terrific action and the characters never lost me. I've watched it a few times and catch something that I originally missed the first time. I just love the film, overall a really great selection.",positive
My favourite bond movie ever I think.,positive
M now understands her role in my life.,positive
Great acting. Great action. Great script. The best Bond film.,positive
"The revitalization of a once assumed dead franchise. After the horrible ""Die Another Day"" I was all ready to give up on 007. But, this movie changed all of that. Highly recommended.",positive
"a much needed overhaul of a tired series. enticing plot, character maturation, and some close calls make CR a must see for bond fans or action buffs alike.",positive
"Daniel Craig's iteration of the legendary superspy 007 breaths life back into the series. With this movie being the first of a series reboot, Craig's portrayal is now more gritty and no-BS version. From the same director of GoldenEye.",positive
Daniel Craig is the true James Bond.,positive
I'll never watch another Bond film with Daniel Craig starring.,negative
REALY LOVE DANIEL CRAIG AND THIS ONE,positive
"One of my favorite Bond films. Although I really have a hard time thinking of it as Bond without the cheesy jokes, crazy villains, gadgets and all. James Bond is the guy you call when someone wants to rule the world with a mad scheme, not terrorists. But that does not stop this from being a good movie.",positive
"I've never been a huge fan of James Bond movies, but this movie reinvigorates the series by adding a raw plausibility while keeping a slight element of the cheesy bravado that made the series in the first place. Cleverly written and well acted; Daniel Craig's interpretation of the superspy is super interesting, but I wish the camera would've dwelled a bit more on his feelings than his punches. Still, a special shout-out to the fight scenes and especially the initial black-and-white intro. I really wanted to like this movie a bit more that I actually did - the direction could be a bit more invigorated, a little less Hollywood, but you take what you can get. James Bond will be one to watch; I'm looking forward to future installment in the series.",negative
"Best James Bond movie ever! Casino Royale throws out the classic cheesy, but lovable, Bond pickup lines and focuses on how James Bond became 007. With a amazing performance by Daniel Craig helps makes this the best movie of the franchise and one of the best films of the decade.",positive
The action and acting is too good to be true but it is. The story is a bit convoluted if you're slower than average which keeps this hit from being a classic.,positive
One of the best in the series after Golden Eye.,positive
"- Don't worry, you are no my type - Smart? - No, single.",positive
"horrible movie, lots of plotholes. slow and boring.",negative
Watched this so many times and still is my all time favorite Bond Flick. Eva Green is a bonus.,positive
"GREAT Bond movie, This movie made me love Bond movies, Daniel Craig is perfect as the lead, and the action and plotlines are FUN, I definitely recommend this :)",positive
"Honestly, Craig was no Bond. The gadgets and the siliness were a part of what made it great, not what plauged it. Sad to see such a high ranking for such a pitiful remake...",negative
"This smart, intense, and surprisingly moving reboot of the 007 franchise leaves all the campy and over the top elements of its predecessors. instead, it relies on strong character development, tight action scenes, and breathtaking cinematography to make a satisfying motion picture.",positive
"Casino Royale isn't just another James Bond movie. It's the ultimate Bond adventure and origin story. Bond's journeys chronologically from Dr. No all the way up to Die Another Day-the last Bond film to star Pierce Brosnan as the tittle character-have been acceptional to excellent with Goldfinger being the most ultimate 007 for decades. But still, Casino Royale aproximate two hours and thirty minutes allow for it to top Goldfinger. Casino even fills up Bond's gas tank enough to give him what I expect to more than double his current total amount of adventures. For years MGM wanted to do Casino Royale because it's their most iconic character's origin story, but couldn't do so due to legal rights. When the studio aquired the rights they got everything right the first time. They hired Martin Campbell a director with a 007 background in his filmography after directing Brosnan in GoldenEye (which also revitalized the secret agent franchise), give the part of the tittle character to Daniel Craig (who gives fans the most hard nose and badass performance as Bond), and the screenplay is so suspenseful with the British government possibly facing their biggest mistake. All in all, Casino Royale is the holy grail of 007.",positive
"It is one of the greatest remakes ever, and quite possibly the best Bond ever. This is not you average Bond movie your family goes to see, this is Daniel Craig showing his ""I don't give a shit and I'll do what needs to be done"" attitude. While the events leading to his capture could have been better, Craig just tops it with better acting, which I thought was impossible.",positive
Casino Royale has topped every Bond movie. Daniel Craig being the new Bond does it amazingly. The best by far. Casino Royale is full of action and cool fighting/shooting scenes. Must watch for anyone Bond and action movie fan.,positive
"Dad and I have been doing some father/son Bonding and of all the ones we've seen, I don't think you can really top this with anything besides a couple of the Connery films (or Goldeneye). Then again, I've read the books, and the reason why this works if because THIS is what Fleming wrote.",positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery.,positive
"Not just a Bond movie. But a well-written and deeply moving character study that puts Bond in a new light. Also not your ordinary Bond movie. This is apparent from the very beginning as the opening credits are sung over by Chris Cornell making it the first Bond film to have a male vocalist sing the opening credits. This movie is nearly two and a half hours long, and rightly so. It holds your attention not through cheap thrills and Bay-like explosions but elements of tension in the story that slowly peel back the layers of Bond's psyche as we learn how he reacts to them and just why he acts the way he does. This is something I never expected to get insight into, as no Bond movie I ever saw ventured this deep into the character. There is something so natural about the way Casino Royale plays out (see epic Hold 'em tournament), and so heartbreaking, that I felt moved by it. Not only that but by Daniel Craig's incredible take on James Bond himself. For this movie alone, Craig has solidified himself as the best James Bond there ever was. The franchise was always enjoyable, but I never got as emotionally invested nor cared so much for Bond as in Casino Royale. Not to mention Craig is just the most badass Bond of them all. They will inevitably cast more Bonds in the future, but I never want to see Bond again unless it's Daniel Craig. Casino Royale, like Batman Begins, is a worthy reboot better than all versions that preceded it. And it isn't just a great Bond movie either. Casino Royale is truly a great drama.",positive
"Casino Royale is a welcome break from the past and a strong and entertaining film in its own right, proving the continuing viability of Fleming's creation 50 years after his inception.",positive
"Casino Royale, simply put, is amongst the best Bond movies ever released. Despite being marketed chiefly as having taken away many of the gadgets, Moneypenny, and Q, along with other staples of the Bond universe, this is quintessentially a Bond movie and offers much of what you would expect from such a film. However, Casino Royale goes far beyond this; it surprises at virtually every turn, providing the most compelling version of James Bond ever. This Bond isn't just a suave super-agent capable of dodging bullets, getting the girl, and saving the day; this James Bond, brilliantly portrayed by Daniel Craig, is human. Yes, that is right. Imagine all the goodness that comes from a superb Bond picture mixed with a well-written, compelling, and emotionally affecting drama, and this is Casino Royale. The basic premise revolves around Le Chiffre, this picture's primary antagonist, who is a banker affiliated with terrorists who, thanks to Bond, owes a large amount of money that he doesn't necessarily have. Due to this, he decides to stage a poker game at Casino Royale, located in Montenegro. MI6's plan is to make sure he loses the game, and then, having to flee from the individuals that he owes money to, they will offer him protection in favor of revealing information about those he is financing. In an attempt to ensure that he doesn't win the game, they enlist 007, as the best poker player in the service, and enter him in the competition. Casino Royale, as advertised, does in fact bring James Bond back to the basics. Gadgets are minimal (no invisible car), and, as mentioned, Moneypenny and Q are absent, as is much of the suave attitude typically associated with Bond. This is Bond on his first assignment, and the character acts accordingly; he doesn't quite have the attitude down to pat, but he is still one tough hombre and, when it comes time to save the day, he is more than capable. Don't take this to mean that Bond is ultra-serious this time around, as he still proves proficient in the art of the one-liner, and pithy comments are certainly par for the course as well. Bond is indeed different this time around, but, in this case, this is absolutely a good thing. Daniel Craig has also been criticized for being cast, with one of the chief reasons for this being that he has blond hair. I have nothing more to say than this is down-right ridiculous, and that, once this movie is seen, I believe that people will view Craig as amongst the best, if not the best (that will always be Connery in my mind) Bond ever. He matches the rugged charm that Sean Connery has, but so many Bond's have done this in the past to the point where this has been misinterpreted to mean that Bond should be all about the jokes and the suave attitude (Roger Moore). People often forget that Bond is a killer, and, when it comes down to it, James Bond needs to match being suave with knowing how to rip a man's head off. Connery did this before the character become perverted, and so does Craig. He delivers a Bond that is the perfect mix of all of the best characteristics that make up Bond, and, what's more, he has to play with the concept that Bond hasn't yet become the Bond we know from previous films. However, what truly makes this Bond the most compelling Bond ever is what is done, thanks to both the script and to Craig, with Bond as a human-being. This Bond an intense, emotionally wrought individual that has to deal with a lot more than simply putting away the bad guy this time. This is because, in this film, Bond isn't simply looking to get the girl at the end as Bond's in the past have often done. The beginning is relatively standard (but still above-par) for an action movie such as this, but, as the movie enters its mid-portion, a well-developed, complex, and human relationship develops between Bond and Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green), the accountant hired to aid Bond due to her knowledge of money and how to handle it. This relationship leads to the most emotionally distraught and complex Bond since On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and it is exactly the direction that the character should be taken in to explore new territory. However, this movie isn't all romance and drama; there are a number of high-intensity sequences and exciting action scenes to please any action-movie or Bond-movie fanatic. The earlier portions of the movie offer the biggest action scenes: A sequence occurring near the beginning of the movie, a free-running chase through a construction site and a consulate is one of the best action scenes ever in a Bond movie, and an intense fight within a moving vehicle on the runway of an airport as Bond attempts to stop a henchman from blowing up an airplane is another highlight. The film is commanding and entirely capable of weaving these various elements into each other for a sum greater than its parts, and its quite refreshing to see an action movie that is more than an action movie. Unfortunately, the only passable Quantum of Solace followed this film, and MGM's money problems has delayed the next Bond film until (possibly) 2012, but, for this film at least, Daniel Craig has proved that he deserves to be Bond and has kept me interested in seeing further films in the series. For Casino Royale at least, he provides the perfect complement to a very good script and nimble direction, and all of these elements create a film which is well above expectations for even a Connery Bond film, as well as one of the best action movies of the decade. Rating: 9.0/10",positive
"Decent scenes, great premise for the story, and good performance by Craig and Mikklesen, but the pace slows to a snail-crawl and plot becomes disconnected about halfway through the film. I think getting some help for the 007 franchise from Guy Ritchie, Matthew Vaughn, or Danny Boyle would have helped a great deal. Oh wells.",negative
"A reboot that reinvents the suffering franchise and places it in a modern, realistic context. Daniel Craig fits into the Bond mold superbly, making the agent his own, infusing 007 with equal parts pathos and dry wit, making this Bond perhaps the most human of all his predecessors. Eva Green provides one of the strongest female leads in the series' history (second only to Diana Rigg in OHMSS) and Mads Mikkelsen is terrific as the slimy villain Le Chiffre, infusing him with hubris and interesting strains of anxiety. The action scenes are among the best-filmed of the movies (Martin Campbell also directed the superlative GoldenEye), kinetic and suspenseful.",positive
"If you really need proof of just how much good this film did the franchise, take a look at the Bond film that preceded it: Die Another Day. Yeah. In my eyes, this is pretty much the perfect reboot.",positive
Bond is rebooted with success for the most part.,negative
My first experience with Bond left me surprised and delighted as I will certainly go back and catch up on the first 20.,positive
I tried to find something to like about this movie. It probably didn't help that I had the riffrax of it...or maybe that did help. I thought the movie was interesting until Bond beat le Chiffre in the poker game. It should've ended then but it kept going into a nightmare. Vesper wasn't pretty enough and I didn't believe a single thing Bond said to her. I've never seen a Bond movie before this and I can wait a very long time before I watch another.,negative
Fantastic film from start to finish. I love it with all my heart. Possibly one of my favorite films of all time.,positive
I really liked this new style Bond movie. Much less a family film though with more violence. Daniel Craig is defintely the hottest 007 there has ever been!,positive
"Action, poker, than more action than more poker then finishing with action. Daniel Craig is the best Jame Bond ever. Good directing by Martin Campbell and awesome chemistry between Daniel Craig and Eva Green.",positive
It's almost in the same classic vein as the Sean Connery ones.,positive
just bought this on DVD and it delivers. This sets the standard of how action & 007 movies should be. Daniel Craig is The best Bond EVER. It was ill. FIVE STARS.,positive

Greatest Bond movie ever produced and only one I like.,positive
"SPOILERS WITHIN I'm a big fan of the Bond films - I have all of them on DVD and I have to say, this is the best Bond of the lot. Casino Royale is basically the ""origin"" story re-booted for the 21st century audience which starts with Bond gaining his ""00"" status with the required two kills for him promotion. What follows is over two hours where the character is taken into new territory which is comfortably familiar. After Pierce Brosnan's performance, which was a great take on the Bond character, Daniel Craig was like a breath of fresh air for the franchise. He presents a stripped back Bond - gone is the veneer of posh respectability and swagger of the character that has evolved over the previous twenty films. Craig's Bond is a conflicted character - cold in the way that he goes about his job and detached in his relationships with the people around him, yet who opens himself to the possiblity of a life different from the one that he has created for himself later in the film thanks to Eva Green's character, Vesper Lynd. He also uses what's gone before with the character and twists it to great effect to make a tougher ""rough diamond"" version of the Bond character in scenes such as where he gets a fitted tux courtesy of Vesper and the classic response to the barman who asks whether he wants his Vodka Martini shaken or stirred (""Do I look like I give a damn?"") As Bond girl's go, Eva Green, has to rank amongst the most well rounded characters of them. Yes, she is beautiful, but she also displays an emotional range that goes beyond the stereotypical, ""Oh James"" by being as conflicted as the character of Bond, primarily due to her backstory. She also displays a great sense of comic timing and banter such as the ""well formed arse"" line which she delivers in a wonderfully deadpan manner. Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre is a great opponent to Bond, and is more openly threatening and, despite his charm, is as much a blunt instrument as Bond is. Additionally, the script offers Mikkelsen moments of humour which tie in nicely with the physical quirks or behaviours of previous Bond villians - such as his explanation for weeping blood not being as sinister as it seems or the fact that he prefers to simpler, less elaborate torture methods to extract information. (Now come on gents, surely you crossed your legs at that scene?) Another area where the film benefitted was the fact that Q branch was very much out of the picture, apart from the tracking implant and the medical equipment in Bond's car. Gone is the over the top gadgets which, unfortunately, cluttered up Die Another Day such as the Aston Martin ""Vanish"" - this Bond has to survive on his wits, instinct (which is sometimes fallibly off) and determination. Bringing back Martin Campbell was a stroke of genius. Campbell made a brilliant Bond film in Goldeneye, and this film manages not only to match it but surpass it. Finally, David Arnold's score. Thank goodness, like the character, he got an opportunity to strip back the score and remove all the techno elements which plagued his score for Die Another Day and returned to what I nickname the ""Wah Wah"" type of score which John Barry established. All in all, a great re-establishment for the character. Granted, Quantum Of Solace was not as strong as this, but it was basically Part Two of this film. Really looking forward to Bond 23.",positive
"With a dark and gritty tone, realistic action scquences, hot girls and an excellent performance by Daniel Craig, Casino Royale updates James Bond beautifully for the 21st Century.",positive

"The twenty-first James Bond film, second directed by Martin Campbell (GoldenEye), and the first to star Daniel Craig as 007. After the way-over-the-top CGI heavy ""Die Another Day"", the Bond filmmakers decided to reboot the stale franchise after they saw the success of the Batman reboot ""Batman Begins"". Pierce Brosnan was replaced as Bond, and the writers decided to go back to the original Ian Fleming 007 novel ""Casino Royal"", and rely less on special effects and make the story more realistic and character driven. The film begins with Bond receiving his ""00"" status, and then chasing down an international bomb maker in Madagascar on his first assignment. This takes him to the Bahamas and Miami where he thwarts a terrorist attempt to destroy the prototype of the largest new airliner in the world. This then takes Bond to Montenegro and a high stakes game of Texas hold 'em poker at the ""Casino Royale"" with the mastermind behind everything Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelson), who actually works for a highly secretive organization. While in Montenegro, Bond teams up with British treasury representative Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), MI6 contact Rene Mathis and CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright, the seventh actor in the role). From there Bond travels to Italy for the films climax. Craig's Bond is very tough and hard-edged (which did not work for Timothy Dalton's Bond). When 007 gets into a fight, he actually looks like he has been in a fight afterwards, and not like he hasn't been touched at all. One of the fun things about this movie is the introduction to many of the things we know best about Bond (the Aston Martin, the Vodka-Martini, his tailored suits, etc...). The action sequences are top notch, the women Beautiful, and the main villain is very Euro-Trash, which is fitting for this new version of Bond. As of the twenty-second Bond installment (Quantum of Solace), this is the highest grossing Bond flick worldwide, with its direct sequel ""Solace"" being the second highest. Dame Judy Dench is the only holdover from the previous Bond films, as ""M"", 007's boss. But this time, ""Q"" and Miss Moneypenny are left out all together.",positive
"The intro of Bond here says they mean business. It's fast, it's macho, it's funny and it's smart. Daniel Craig seems to have taken this role as fish to water, and might have done enough to bring the franchise to it's roots.",positive
"This is the best James Bond film without a doubt. It's also one of the best action films of all time. Daniel Craig plays James Bond perfectly. Martin Campbell's directing is flawless. He really makes you feel the fight scenes. He keeps the camera steady and focused on the action scenes. Today, many directors violently shake their cameras during action sequences. Some say that this is done to make the audience feel more like they are there. I think they do it to cut corners, because they can't make an interesting action sequence if they tried. This is not the case here. The camera stays focused on every punch, kick, and gunshot. Eva Green, along with the rest of the cast, work extremely well together, and they are all necessary to the story. None of them are unnecessary filler. In the middle of all the top-notch action, a very high-tension card game takes place. Smaller action scenes are mixed in during breaks in the card game to keep the pace up. Just when you think the movie is drawing to a close, another massive action sequence takes place followed by some ""awesome yet heartbreaking"" acting by the two main characters. This movie is the best pure action film I have ever seen with plenty of mystery and suspense mixed in throughout.",positive
LURVE! Watch it over and over... Daniel Craig = best Bond ever!,positive
"Has taken Bond films to a new level. Could have been a dying franchise but it was reawakened with Daniel Craig's interpretation of Bond. Slicker, more serious and smarter than previous Bonds. Takes us back to the beginning and shows the emotional context through which Bond's misognynous but emotionally detached Bond should be viewed. The action scenes are brilliant from the very start. Eva Green was excellent as well, good to know the best Bond traditions remain.",positive
This was an average movie. I found it not to have the same James Bond feel as the oldies and this new James Bond just doesn't have that ladies-man feeling about him.,negative
"The best Bond film since Dr. No. Seriously, It tops all others with its dark, gritty and morose take on the early double O agent that Bond is.",positive
awsome daniel craig way better than sean connery,positive
"James Bond reinvented in what is tied with ""Goldfinger"" as the best one.",positive
A great movie and Daniele Craig filled some big shoes as becoming James bond and he succeeded,positive
"My favorite James Bond film, they finally brought back the humanization of the character with an amazing start to whats sure to be a great run of films.",positive
this proved to a lot of nonbelievers that the new bond Daniel Craig could do what all the other great Bonds have done. He's shown he can do it as well as them.,positive
Good Bond flick at best. Daniel Craig definitely proves he has what it takes to fill in the shoes of the one only Bond. James Bond,negative
Best Bond since Goldfinger,positive
"Pretty good action film; not my fav James Bond, flick, though.",positive
"Casino Royale is undoubtedly the greatest Bond movie ever made. It's such a spectacular that if someone has missed it,he/she has missed one of the greatest masterpiece of all time. It's TOTALLY riveting movie. The guys want to imitate James Bond after watching it and the girls want to be the bond girl,in their fantasies.",positive
las vi todas pero no soy tan fan de jaimito...,negative
First of all let it be known. I dislike James Bond Movies. So my expectation was pretty low for Casino Royale (2006). After the opening sequence I was hooked. This version of James Bond is the best. It's closer to Jason Bourne but that's fine with me. Craig owns the part. The Story is also based in a real world scenario. One of my all-time favorite movies. Blu Ray Buy!,positive
"Daniel, el Bond definitivo!",positive
"Daniel Craig puts up an extremely memorable performance in what I would consider the best ""Bond"" film yet.",positive
Bond is back.. and this time he is in love !!!!!!!!!,negative
Quite entertaining. Too long and too many stories. But enjoyed the class and style. The love story totally did it for me :),negative
My favorite Bond film. I love this movie.,positive
Good movie but lacking typical Bond gadgets that made the franchise so exciting.,positive
Officially in love with Eva Green. nuff said.,positive
"Bond Begins. This movie is filled with witty dialogues, clever action sequences, and twists. Things I like * Bond caught a gun thrown at him, and then threw it back * M's comments or complaints on Bond * Bond mistaken as a hotel service boy, and then took advantage of it to distract securities * Holmes-style conversation with Vesper Lynd * realistic pick-up scene, with Solange * Bond beaten in Casino, and then poisoned * Bond fell in love for really, quite unexpected * Mandelbrot set using clubs during the theme song Witty lines: M: Who the hell do they think they are? I report to the Prime Minister, and even he's smart enough not to ask me what we do. Have you ever seen such a bunch of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs? They don't care what we do; they care what we get photographed doing. And how the hell could Bond be so stupid? I give him double-O status and he celebrates by shooting up an embassy! Is the man deranged? And where the hell is he? In the old days, if an agent did something that embarrassing, he'd have the good sense to defect! Christ, I miss the Cold War! M (to Bond): Go and stick your head in the sand and think about your future. Vesper: Now, having just met you, I wouldn't go as far as calling you a cold-hearted bastard... Bond: No, of course not. Vesper: But it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine. You think of women as disposable pleasures rather than meaningful pursuits. So, as charming as you are, Mr. Bond, I will be keeping my eyes on our government's money and off your perfectly formed arse. Bond: You noticed. Vesper: Even accountants have imagination. How was your lamb? Bond: Skewered. One sympathizes. Bond: Can I give you a lift home? Solange: That would really send him over the edge. I'm afraid I'm not that cruel. Bond: Well, perhaps you're just out of practice. Solange: Perhaps Bond: What about a drink at my place? Solange: Your place? Is it close? Bond: Very. Solange: One drink. Vesper: Am I going to have a problem with you, Mr. Bond? Bond: No, don't worry, you're not my type. Vesper: Smart? Bond: Single. Bond: You don't think this is a very good plan, do you? Vesper: So there is a plan. I got the impression that were risking millions of dollars and hundreds of lives on a game of luck. Vesper: I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman. Bond: That is something to be afraid of. Vesper: James, I want you to know that if all that was left of you was your smile and your little finger, you'd still be more of a man than any I've known. Bond: That's because you know what I can do with my little finger.",positive
"Revamping a dying franchise that focused too much of double entendres for names, an overused plot formula, and goofy gadgets, Daniel Craig's Bond breaths new life into Ian Fleming's original character, sparking a film that can match up to the films of the Sean Connery era.",positive
Best Bond film ever.,positive
"One of the best, if not the best, Bond films in the series. Awesome action, sexy women, explosions, great script, great acting. Fantastic film.",positive
hands down the best bond film ever made,positive
best once since from russia with love,positive
"Great way to continue the Bond franchise, and Craig is an amazing Bond. A lot like the original story and not the piss-take film, this is a great action film, with all the GOOD elements of a GOOD Bond film!",positive
"Casino Royale revitalized a struggling Bond franchise and put a new, darker twist on Bond's character. The plot is perfect, the screenplay, witty and purposeful. The ending somehow leaves the whole movie wrapped up in a pretty package, yet you still want more. I can't describe just how insanely cool the last 20 seconds of this movie are...I was left speechless and found wanting.",positive
A fabulous reboot with a new Bond and a new look. Grand!,positive
I can watch this amazing film over and over again and enjoy it more each time :),positive
"a return to greatness,back when Sean Connery was 007.",positive
"Though it's very different from it's predecessors, Casino Royale is proof that sometimes different is better. Much better.",positive
"The greatness of a bond agent is directly proportional to the humanity of his script. I do not have the courage to discredit other bond characters but in this movie comes to my mind a Human a person that feel pain,anger, hate, disappointment, love. Not to mention the exquisite story of bond that doesn't want to save the world and a villain that doesn't want to destroy it.. isn't that such a cliche in a James Bond kind of film? Under my view Daniel Craigh is the best bond since ever.",positive
Good Bond movie..but...it needed some serious editing.,negative
Good Bond movie..but...it needed some serious editing.,negative
"While I'm not enamored with it like many critics, it is still a very solid action film. I say action film rather than Bond film because it lacks many of the qualities that one associates with the series. That being said it is a solid reboot that reset the franchise in a positive direction and is probably one of the better made films in series.",positive
i love this movie. daniel craig makes a hell of a james bond,positive
SHIRTLESS DANIEL CRAIG OMGGG,positive
good action at times but a little boring in the middle,negative
"The best 007 out there, at least in my eyes. It's my favorite one, and Daniel Craig is my favorite James Bond!",positive
"I've never liked Bond movies, until now!",positive
My 2nd Favourite being only beaten by Goldfinger,positive
"This is among the best bond movies! You have to see it. After all the controversy and comments on Daniel Craig's potential as an actor and doubts over him playing Bond...i'd say forget it and be enthralled by the new BOND! He's here to stay. He has that natural feeling about him when you see him on the screen as Bond, that attitude, style, confidence matched only by Sean COnnery. The movie as a whole is extremely entertaining and exciting.The acting is awesome Eva Green actually does a great job and has really improved her acting from the last time i saw her (in kingdom of heaven), but then this is a totally different movie. There's a lot of action mixed with great story which i am sure will please the true Bond fan. Please go and watch this because you will regret if you don't, forget the past this is the New Bond.",positive
Gritty and realistic this film is the closest to what Ian Fleming wrote. I really enjoyed this action-packed film.,positive
"Casino Royale is clumsy in the sense that this is the first James Bond mission, yet we've seen him for fifty years in nineteen other movies. I'm not quite sure that the Felix Leiter character is accurate, as we saw him in 'Dr. No.' How could Bond not know him there after meeting him here? It has the beautiful women of a bond movie (like Caterina Murino) and exotic locales of the Bahamas, Italy, and Czechoslovakia. He's probably a bit less suave, and more gritty, than a typical Bond.",negative
"One of the best bond movies, the film that launched Craig's career in America. Great writing with brilliant directing carry this fast paced actioner exploring the roots of 007.",positive
The best James Bond movie of the decade. With charm and swaggar Daniel Craig plays a surprisely great James Bond. Probaly the only time in a movie that poker was actually exciting. The plot is full action and suspense that has you cheering for Bond the whole way.,positive
"from the first action sequence, a chase across the town, the movie is good. Daniel Craig delivers a very hard haerted Bond that kills first, no quesions asked. A very good bond movie and worth the watch.",positive
"It's like a well-written run-on sentence that would typically outlast its stay; but, this isn't your typical film. The entrance of Daniel Craig is a welcome one, as he plays Bond in masterful form. One thing that makes this one different from the others is the disarmed, emotional essence of Bond as he is given the soul of a human, finally.",positive
Favourite movie ever! Love where is the movie is set and the actor is amazing,positive
i hate craig daniel as bond...and this new series is offensively awful,negative
At least 30minutes too long with a plot full of holes and baffling continuity errors (how many times does Bond change his outfit during that poker game)... but its worth the price of admission for that brilliant free running sequence at the start. A welcome return to form after all the silliness of Die Another Day's Invisible Cars and Madonna.,negative
"The Daniel Craig era for the James Bond franchise starts off with a bang. The usual stuff in the James Bond movies with gadgets, fighting, and the odd ball humour.",positive
The film that all future Bonds will have to measure up to.,positive
"good movie with plenty of action, but boring in some parts",positive
"A great reboot of the Bond franchise. Many people were skeptical of Daniel Craig, but he did such a great job portraying Bond. This movies tells the very early career of Bond and his very first missions. There is a lot more action in this film compared to the Bonds before and there is a lot more realistic approaches compared to the cheesy events in Bond films from the past. I personally enjoyed this film an have seen it many times. Although the sequel seemed very rushed I have faith that Craigs third outing as Bond will be as amazing as this film!",positive
"Total let down, not Bond as we know it. The series ended with Brosnan for me.",negative
"The best Bond film in a long time. Daniel Craig is ruthless, yet sentimental as the titular character. My father and I argue about this one because he believes James Bond films should have more gadgets and ridiculous action scenes. I think the film has grown on him, though. One of the things I did like about this interpretation was the grittiness and realism of the film. The free running at the film's opening was quite memorable and the torture scene was haunting and effective. The scenery made the film complete.",positive
"If it doesn't beat Goldfinger, its at least the best Bond film since Goldfinger. Daniel Craig is the cold blooded, witty bond that we've been missing since the Connery era. Moore was too damn old and cartoony, Dalton was fun, and Brosnan's hair just did that flopping up and down thing too much. Craig is Bond, and anyone who thinks otherwise can just kiss his Walther PPK. Pros + The Storyline direct from Ian Flemming's 1st Novel + The Action Scenes are top notch. The best in the series! + Le Chiffre great villain, Vesper great Bond girl + Great Music Cons",positive
Film making? yes. Story? no.,negative
"A well made movie but bond seemed to heartless. Craig is great as bond but often seems souless,; killing people with no remorse. Entertaining movie with a great opening chase scene, but a bit too long.",negative
ummmm daniel graig is the sexiest james bond ever,positive
it was ok but no great acting,negative
Talent overcrowded by the broken Bond concept,negative
This movie should really be renamed AWESOME! the movie:D,positive
"Probably the best Bond film ever made, and one of the best action films for that matter. I love this movie!",positive
"First time i saw it i was unsure about if i liked it or not. I did go see it about two weeks after again, and i loved it, and continue too. Great acting, story, action, and twists.",positive
A very solid James Bond movie. Great action and good villain. Fast paced and fun.,positive
"I think this is the one I saw not positive though but if it is, good movie.",positive
"I didnt like this @ first but i have now learnt to accept it :) Although I prefer the fun and sometimes unrealistic stuff that comes out of the other Bond films, I think its about time for somewhat of a modernising reboot that transforms this cheesy adventure entertainment into more of a spy thriller blockbuster franchise that it should be :D",positive
Great James Bond movie! Daniel Craig is great in the first of his 007 installment!,positive
"An acceptable addition to the 007 saga, but I just can't accept Craig as Bond for some reason.",negative
Tuli katteltua joku seitsemÃ¤nnen kerran tÃ¤mÃ¤. Ehdottomasti parhain Bondi. Kandee kattoa. :),positive
"This might be the Bond movie the most realistic character development, not that the ones with Connery don't; i'm just saying that you can tell the filmmakers of Casino Royale are really trying to add that in. There is one thing I didn't like about the film though, and that was how about 80 percent of the action completely bored me! In the old ones I was entertained the whole way through (even the ones with Roger Moore) In Casino Royale I didn't care about the action. I still think I can get past that because of some other superb scenes, like the scene with where Craig was poisoned. Also the movie looks great and the cast is perfect. The soundtrack: spot on! I just wanted more out of it. Did I hear this was Quentin Tarantino's idea? Well hell; let him direct the fucking film. He's a genius! As a critic, before I saw this movie I thought ""is this the best a Bond reboot can be?"" And it wasn't. I could easily see Tarantino making it that. It's still not a bad film and I liked it for the most part. I'm actually gong to be generous by giving Casino Royale 3 stars. Good acting, a good script, heart and emotional scenes involving character development...in an action movie! I highly respect this movie for all that. Worth a watch.",negative
Very strong reboot to this franchise that had gotten too far into the absurd.,positive
"Daniel Craig, although blonde and blue-eyed, plays Bond with the best of 'em.",positive
"Probably the best James Bond in recent memory. Who needs those high tech gadgets and gimmick to make a Bond film? Just throw some great and dark storyline, quick and fluid action scene, a little bit of humour and the acting of Daniel Craig. You get one of the best film in recent history.",positive
James Bond is still cool,positive
Nice movie with a reasonable pace.....,positive
The reboot every Bond-fan was waiting for,negative
Best Bond film since Goldeneye!,negative
Can't go wrong with a bit of Bond action. Worth watching but not spectacular.,negative
Wow! Just forget everything you know about a Bond film. This is a must-see.,positive
"the later part of this decade has seen several 'reboots' to long time film franchises (batman, superman, star trek), and this movie does it oh-so-well. definitely the most sophisticated plot that has ever been in a bond film.",positive
the best bond ever...,positive
A fresh take on Bond that doesn't disappoint.,positive
"Great back to basics debut for Daniel Craig's James Bond, the picture quality is phenomenal on blu ray if you have a blu ray player buy buy buy I can't recommend this enough.",negative
Ahhh..James Bond movies. Such excellent movies. They always leave a special place in my heart. Unfortunately this movie left a special place of future heart attack from the immense rage I experienced after watching this garbage. I thought the best parts of this movie were the previews and the scene where Daniel Craig gets repeatedly hit in the balls. I hope to god that Pierce Brosnan manages to stop singing momma mia and make another master piece of a movie like Die Another Day. (happy birthday k'ale <3),negative
Action packed & sexy!,negative
"The perfect effort to keep guys wanting to be Bond, and the film critics happy.",positive
"One of the best Bond movies, I have seen. Daniel Craig's 007 is the darkest and roughest incarnation. Casino Royale and the new rebooted James Bond franchise has realism that has not been seen in a long time in the classic series. The best part is Craig's 007 has the closes characterization to the original novels.",positive
"The beginning's worth it,but it doesn't show any gadgets,it has some intense action and shootings,quantum of solace was ok,but this is better,I can't wait for the other james bond movie in 2012 its going to be very good I guess.",negative
Excellent reintroduction of Bond and 5th favorite movie,positive
"a fantastic return of the franchise. the length is perfect for the intense plot and great writing. if you are a james bond fan, do not miss this movie!",positive
"One of the most epic bond films out there, so much for a recent one.",positive
Fantastic. Daniel Craig is an absolute force as Bond!!,positive
"I've never been a big fan of Bond but this one is different. It's like how Christopher Nolen brought Batman back, more real and more human; Campbell had brought Bond back and he is not perfect and can get hurt. I think the world's had enough of Bond being as invincible as Superman.",positive
Just plain cool. Blows other Bond films out of the water.,positive
"Daniel Craig est blond et j'm'en fout, j'emmerde ceux qui disent que Bond n'est pas blond ! Il est génial Craig dans le rôle et j'espère qu'il va faire plein d'autres encore. Dans ce film là on voit les débuts de Bond et y'a encore plus d'action qu'avant ! Trop Mortel !!!!",positive
"Not sure what all the hype was about in this movie. didn't think it was that great. Yeah, the action was cool and all but found the movie kind of boring. Also, don't like Daniel Craig as James Bond. They need to find a new guy or just stop making the movies. Cause they keep getting worse and worse",negative
This is one of the finest of all the 007 movies. I was amazed the opening song wasn't up for an oscar. Great song or not it (like the rest of the film) captured the essence of Bond without rehash or parody.,positive
The biggest breath of relief one could ask for. There is hardly anything not to like about the movie.,positive
"Stylish, smart, and sexy, Casino Royale is perhaps the greatest in the 007 series, delivering breathtaking stunts and some clever in-jokes.",positive
"In film reviewing, comparisons prove to be a mixed bag. Tagging, say, Tom Hanks as ""the next Jimmy Stewart"" essentially pigeonholes the work of both actors, basically relegating them into a generic product that can be marketed and sold like art played out as a Cola War. In the case of the Double Oh sensation Casino Royale, however, the art demands comparison. For nearly 45 years, the series has ridden the ebb and flow of changing societal mores, fashions, and politics with 5 different leading men--apple vodkas and orange vodkas, but vodka nonetheless. Like lightning re-bottled, Casino Royale has embraced a grittier edge while retaining enough clever nods to its forebears to wholly earn it and Daniel Craig a place just beneath Goldfinger and Sean Connery as the best of the series. For the 21st installment, the producers have decided to reboot the franchise by losing the eyebrow-raising gadgetry and ridiculous plot-points and investing in a more organic realism. To achieve this, they reached back to the very beginning by adapting Sir Ian Fleming's first Bond novel Casino Royale, which follows the young government agent (Craig) through his early days tracking a terrorism financier to a infamous European casino where the stakes are deathly high. The action sequences define intensity. Green gives us, perhaps, Bond's most likely (and, because of this) most smoldering love interest. Though it begins to feel a little long toward the end, this reviewer can't suggest a single scene in need of snipping. Casino Royale is so good, in fact, that ""the Bottom Line"" should remain to be seen. It is dubious that any series could keep up this momentum. Bottom line: Winning bet.",positive
It is an alright movie but it's not best 007,negative
Absolutely the greatest ACTION MOVIE that I have ever seen. It had ACTION in it.,positive
Better than Quantum of Solace.,positive
"My favorite James Bond movie, because, well...because of Daniel Craig. He is to Bond what sand is to Hayden Christiansen: coarse and rough and irritating, however I'll go a step further and say that while all those three are true, he's also, simply put, brilliant. He is the Bond of the books, the dark, nitty-gritty secret agent who also can get the girl and play cards AND pull off a tuxedo. This movie has amazing visuals and some awesome actions pieces, but it's the torture scene in the middle of the movie that shows just how tough Craig's Bong is. If only Quantum of Solace was as good, and if only MGM hadn't gone bankrupt, because I'm suffering from Bond withdrawal right now!",positive
"Casino Royale's forte on big-budget Bourne-like action sequences and lengthy romantic developments made this certainly a well made movie, but for die hard fans this cannot be called a Bond movie.",negative
It's James Bond of course it's good,positive
"It's been along time since a movie sucked me in as much as this but that's because I've always loved James Bond and it's been a long time since one has not only been good but thinks of things you haven't even thought about. Pretty much everything in this movie is excellent to the acting, writing, directing, sets, locations, action, stunts, thrills, and anything you'd expect to see in a Bond movie. If you like Bond or movies in general, especially action/thrillers than this is a must see.",positive
I thought it was one of the BEST Bond movies. And Daniel is hot!,negative
Not much of a bond fan but quite liked this.,negative
"Best of all the Bond films. Daniel Craig IS James Bond. The plot is great, action was great, and best of all the movie overall is tremendous. Daniel Craig takes the pedistal as the best James Bond since the original. The plot is amazing, the action is awesome and well made. Casino Royale is genius and I feel sorry for you if you didnt like it.",positive
"Helt plÃ¶tsligt blev Bond en riktig actiofilm, Daniel Craig Ã¤r utan tvekan den bÃ¤sta bond jag sett.",positive
"One of the best. Manages to outclass George, Tim and Pierce in one go.",positive
Daniel Craig is the best bond since Sean Connery.,positive
"pure action, really enjoyed it",negative
"Easily the best Bond since Connery helmed the role, Casino Royale almost perfectly captures the character with stunning action sequences, suavity and intrigue, and intelligent writing. Personally one of my favorite movies of that year. Rating: Full Price",positive
"Daniel Craig brings his guns to the table and they are loaded. He injects new vigor into this failing franchise and reboots it back to its roots. Everyone involved in this film deserves a pat on the back and maybe a few oscar nominations. Craig deserves a win, but could settle for a nomination. Anyone who loves this 007 franchise, especially the Connery and Moore films, is guaranteed to be totally riveted by this 2006 entry.",positive
"I love me James Bond, but this was so totally new/different from the others that it took me awhile to warm up to it. It has its flaws. Much more of an action flick than the originals, but it did breathe fresh life into one of my favorite movie franchises.",negative
"Not enough action as seen in past Bond films. Overall, I think the casting crew could have found a more suitable person to play the Bond role which could have been more successful.",negative
Daniel Craig's first Bond adventure is FANTASTIC! A different turn for a Bond movie but it works!,positive
"Mads Mikkelsons character is menacing and both interesting, along with a good action movie, Daniel Craig is an OK Bond but didn't really care for him.",negative
"Not only my favorite Bond film, but my favorite movie. I was not sure about Daniel Craig at first, well much like this movie, he is also my favorite Bond. I saw this movie nine times in the theater and watched the DVD everyday for three months. I even own a copy on PSP. This movie represents what Bond should be. No over the top, unrealistic gadgets or sets, and the characters for once are all believable.",positive
"great action film with an emotional punch. Drags a little towards the end, but it's necessary. The problem is that it isn't James Bond, just a good movie with the 007 label",positive
"Hands down my favorite Bond film. Ian Flemming created a Bond that every man wanted to be, and every woman wanted, Daniel Craig is that Bond.",positive
maybe best bond movie ever...? at least the best since sean connery.,positive
The most authentic Bond film in recent years is Casino Royale. The new darker version of Bond has mortality stamped all over him (for once).,positive
Best Bond movie yet in my opinion.,positive
An interesting reboot which deserves to be acclaimed. 7.5/10,positive
"Great action movie and one of the best Bonds. Craig scales back Bond to a less gadget base and more physical force, cool and collected. The series borrows a lot from the Jason Bourne style of movie and it is a good thing to see a less funny, more serious Bond to remind us what it use to be. It also shows that the movies can be clever and have humor without losing the high stakes feel. The enemies are still extreme but believable and it is also good that they are establishing an over-arching story within the stand alone movies.",positive
Daniel Craig is sexy in this,positive
"I have never much been a Bond fan, and I didn't start until the horrible Brosnan films, so this was a treat. It took things seriously and everyone betraying everyone was awesome. Craig is a great Bond and the entire cast is actually a lot of fun. Is Green the hottest Bond girl ever??? I also got into Poker around the time, so the poker scenes were pretty intense for me. The action scenes rock and I simply loved how it ended.",positive
"Yes, I am biased against Daniel Craig as Bond. But I finally gave this movie a go and well...I thought it was ok. Granted there were a few things that were surprisingly good - like the Bond girl here had more of a backbone, and didn't jump into the sack with double-o immediately. The car (when it was whole) was gorgeous, and some of the gadgets we caught a glimpse of were snazzy as well. What I didn't like (among other things): M was made to be more whiny - which was irritating as both the character and the actor playing her are strong. Craig may be rough-and-tough for some, but I found him faltering between Brosnan's Bond and Jason Bourne. Some of the action were just toooo unrealistic, and in some places the movie just lagged in the story telling, while in others apparently you were expecting to just magically figure out what was going on (at the break-neck speed those scenes were going at). Some other interesting turn of events/characters, but they weren't examined any deeper. I still will give Quantum of Solace a chance, but not immediately. Unless I catch it on tv or something..",negative
Fantastic James Bond movie!!!,positive
"Well I didn`t see this coming! After ""Die another day"" friends had to force me into the cinema to see this, and dammit! It turns out to be the best Bond ever! Tight, crisp and dangerous!",positive
I loved it. I'm glad they decided to tone down the cheesie punch lines. I love Vesper and I love David Arnold's compositions.,positive
Thank you Daniel Craig for resuscitating the James Bond franchise! Away with the sterile hand-models and in with the brawny bad-ass.,positive
O melhor Bond de sempre. Grande filme.,positive
best Bond movie ever!,positive
The best bond film so far!,negative
"Casino Royale, thanks to excellent action, Daniel Craig, who is one of the best James Bonds, an excellent script, and great acting, is one of the best Bond movies to date. It captures Bond's grittiness better than any other movie before, making for a movie that has a great mix of original tones, content from the novels, and classic bond traditions! This is an action movie at its finest!",positive
I saw this on opening night in my theatre and was totally blown away. A +++,positive
"This Bond is actually believable. the plot is good, and so is the action.",positive
"Bond is back in a big way!Playing as a prequel to the original films,we are given the origin of the now beloved 007.Daniel Craig gives the perfect performance as the classic secret agent,my favorite since the Bond films of the late 80s.This is actually pretty close an adaption to Ian Fleming's original novel,which is a first.Plus this Bond is actually more gritty then many of the others.Well directed by Martin Campbell(GoldenEye,another great)the film jumps right into high gear with an impressive opening chase scene that will wear you out just watching!My only real complaint is that the card playing scenes can get a bit boring,kind of the way the golf scenes were in Goldfinger.But,with that aside,I had a great time with Royale.A real Bond to last throughout the 21st century and beyond.",positive
"3 measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet, shaken over ice, with a thin slice of lemon peel",positive
"Not only one of the best Bonds but one of my fave films, Casino Royale has everything. The card game is as gripping as the action scenes (a hard trick to pull off), Chris Cornell's song is the best since Live and Let Die, Craig is perfect as Bond and the villain weeps blood. What a gripping movie.",positive
"Greatest Bond in years and the closest to Ian Fleming's books! Bond doesn't fall in love, however. He moves on. That sounds bad but James Bond is a confirmed bachelor in the books and movies. Other than that, awesome!",positive
"This marks the death of Bond as far as I'm concerned, even the opening song sucks and is the worse to date. Daniel Craig is an ugly unlikeable jerk, his love is unlikeable and neither of them are dashing by any measure . If you consider yourself a bond fan and like this movie, do the world a favor and bite the cyanide capsule! The series has always been stupid and fun, but now its just stupid and depressing.",negative

"Simply brilliant. Quite possibly the best Bond film ever made. Daniel Craig delivers a gritty, rugged performance as we go back to the beginning of his 007 career. The action scenes are awesome and there are nail-biting moments aplenty. More of the same with the next one please",positive
Its Bond trying to be Bourne....at least its better than quantum,negative
"One of my all time favorite movies. Woe! I love Daniel Craig as James Bond! This movie had the right combination of actions, amazing stunts, luxury and glitz, romance, and great fighting scenes. I really enjoyed the story as well.",positive
"Favorite 007 movie hands down. Craig's personality and wit put him up there with some of the Bond greats. Constructed story, and developed characters. The ambiance of the scenes are just jaw-dropping, and cope well with one another. Highly recommend this movie for any one-- Bond fans or not.",positive
"Daniel Craig is the Bond we've been waiting for to revolutionize the role of 007. With an often tortured demeanor about him, he stills remains suave and cavalier. ""Casino Royale"" delivers all that is promised to us in a Bond film, while remaining unpredictable, an element that has been missing in 007 films since the beginning. With the idea that a Bond film is only as good as its villain remains true, as Mads Mikkelsen delivers a brilliant performance as Le Chiffre. Eva Green also screams perfection, grabbing attention with every appearance, yet remaining humanized, also an element lacking from previous installments, and leading up to one of the biggest reveals in a Bond film yet. ""Casino Royale"" is the re-invigoration that the series needed and will hopefully push this series to pinnacle of its potential.",positive
Since the old school Bond movies this is the best that I have seen. The story is great and Daniel Craig makes a great young bond.,positive
One word forgettable.,negative
"I haven't seen many Bond films... and those that I've seen I may have been too young to fully appreciate, but I really enjoyed ""Casino Royale"", which I started watching while dead tired at 1AM and couldn't stop watching until it was finished. I look forward to more in the series!",positive
"Daniel Craig is James Bond. Sort of. Casino Royale ushers in the new era of James Bond films like we've never seen it before. Taking us back to when Bond first becomes an agent, we see a vulnerable 007 on his first ever mission learning many of his traits that we have come to know him by so well. Without a doubt Casino Royale is a sucess and has brought new life into the dying series (Die Another Day anyone? No, thought not.). Stripped bare, there is no Q, no moneypenny, no elaborate gadgets or over the top storyline and it works quite well. However, the film runs more like a Bourne film than a Bond film and although ultimately this may be a good thing, I kind of missed the usual extravegences. Daniel Craig is everything James Bond should be yet I struggle to see him as James Bond. Time will tell whether I learn to accept him as James Bond but in the meantime I can't knock his execution and performance. A thoroughly enjoyable action flick and while I have my reservations about this new James Bond era I will certainly enjoy where it takes us. ""I'm sorry. That last hand... nearly killed me. """,negative
It has Craig Daniel what else do you need? The only 007 I can watch move than once.,positive
Great movie tons of action,positive
Instant Masterpiece.,positive
"Daniel Craig replace to Pierce Brosnan in the role of James Bond in this entertaining film. The movie starts with a small scene/presentation of Daniel Craig as the new 007 agent and the typical James Bond initial credits (which like other times are very original), after this begins a film with spectacular action scenes and really good rhythm. The story is interesting and during all the movie there is intrigue and is good, but in other times can be a bit boring or unsense. The performances are good, I will underline the performance of Daniel Craig and Mads Mikkelsen as the bad of the movie. To conclude, I would say that the film is a film of Bond, James Bond so you imagine what you are going to watch.",positive
My favorite Bond films. The jokes are good and the action is exceptional. Check this one out!,positive
The best James Bond movie ever. Daniel Craig ditches the gadgets and the cars and goes for a more realistic spy. Flawless film.,positive
"Pizzera a full, medio aburrida y la acciÃ³n es buena, pero mal distribuida. Si hubiera sido mÃ¡s corta, no serÃ­an necesarias las pizzas.",negative
Best Bond since Goldeneye,positive
"Bond movies have lost their magic and grown stale, but Casino Royale gives the Bond the face lift it has been desperately needing. Engaging throughout, the two and a half hour reboot will definitely be worth your time.",positive
Freakin' awesome. Daniel Craig kicks so much butt as James Bond.,positive
Great reboot last half hour drags a bit but necessary for the series. Craig is great,positive
"Wednesday, January 19, 2011 (2006) Casino Royale ACTION/ ADVENTURE Reinventing the whole James Bond franchise since the previous one Die Another Day starring Pierce Bronsnon costed the studio a lot of money figuring that by restarting the franchise all over again might bring in more revenue, from using less money! In this one James Bond (Daniel Craig) intercept a terrorist funding ring lead by Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) with the help and aid of love interest Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) Danial Craig is good as the title role except that the story seemed uninteresting after a few viewings. Also the action sequences don't seem to connect whereas at the beginning shows an African guy by the name of Lateef Crowder doing 'free running' to another scene Craig taking on some goons on a stairwell and another scene near the end showcasing a car crashing from a distance! Supposedly the first story about how Bond became who he was in the first place, who had intentions to settle down and so forth until coming across with some double crosses! 2.5 out of 4",negative
I was surprised how decent this movie was.,positive
I am a huge sucker for Bond films and think Daniel Craig makes for an EXCELLENT Bond. This movie is epic! I highly recommend it.,positive
"Suit up and go for a ride with Bond, James Bond.",positive
My favorite Bond film. Ever.,positive
"The best bond film yet. Craig is outstanding and most importantly, convincing and entertaining.",positive
"This was really well done action packed, only disappointing factor is how disconnected they made this from other Bond movies. It should have the James Bond theme throughout this movie, I only heard it at the end as a gag. It's supposed to OPEN with James Bond drawing his pistol and opening scene followed by a theme song sequence. Still pretty good, but disappointing seeing it this way",negative
I loved this one. Craig makes a great Bond,positive
"Never saw the original, but I enjoyed the action and plot of this Bond remake",negative
Some action movies are just plain bad. This one isn't,positive
Daniel Craig's got the feet to fill the shoes. Now I can actually take James Bond seriously when he fights people.,negative
Greatest James Bond film ever...ever,positive
Saw this for the 3rd time. I love this movie. Great reboot. Toughest Bond since the days of Sean Connery.,positive
"Debut of Daniel Craig as James Bond was very satisfying. Although the standard characters are not too prominent, but the aura of grim and hard that brought Craig here successfully provide its own color for this legendary spy character. The story told was very remarkable, more intellectual, not like the Bond movies in Pierce Brosnan era, which is too highlight the complexity of international conflict. The work of Martin Campbell here has a story that is more focused, not many plot holes, maybe a little to match the era of Sean Connery! Good job!",positive
Wat mij betreft de beste James Bond film die ik gezien heb. Na de gladde films hiervoor is deze veel rauwere versie een verademing. Daarnaast is Pierce Brosnan vervangen door Daniel Craig ook een prima keuze!,positive
"hey, james bond isn't silly anymore!!!",negative
Friggin' amazing. Best Bond ever.,positive
"Amazing and full of action, suspence and visual effects from the start to the end. Craig is the best 007 ever.",positive
"Daniel Craig silenced his critics with what could be the best James Bond performance ever. Casino Royale ranks as my favorite 007 film as well as one of my all time favorites. It's dramatic storyline, action, pacing and character development is the combo the franchise had been missing for quite some time. Casino Royale was the breath of fresh air the James Bond series needed.",positive
one of the better Bond-movies,negative
The Bond we've been waiting for.,positive
it was all right miss Sean Connery and Piers though i grew up on them,negative
"Its has been awhile since I saw a good James Bond movie since Sean Connery(he's the best by the way!). And when I saw the trailer for this, I thought ""Man, another actor doing ANOTHER Bond movie? Come on."" But I gave it a shot, and man, was I wrong! Casino Royale is one of the best James Bond movies since the old ones with Connery! Daniel Craig does a pretty good James Bond and this movie gives its best! Im not gonna say like ""its a Deffinate 100%!"" But Im giving it a 92%. I like this Bond movie alot..but will there be a better one in the future with a better Bond actor and with a better story? We will see. Again, Casino Royale is a must see.",positive
Very refreshing to see a good Bond film in a long time.,positive
"In a decade when reboots seem to be all the rage this one certainly doesn't disappoint - the world's number one spy/assassin is back with a bang. Clever, exciting with just enough of the old camp humour, this is a more realistic and, dare I say it, brutal Bond than we've seen before. Top stuff.",positive
One of my favorite movies!,positive
Quite possibly the best bond!,positive
The best bond film ever in my opinion :),positive
"When someone says James Bond, most people would think Sean Connery, suits, jokes, gadgets and many good looking women. it appears like this movie lacks most of these things, James Bond have moved from its own special genre to mainstream Hollywood action movie",negative
One of the best Bond movies.,positive
"How can such a dreary, porridge flavoured bore be considered a Bond classic? Oh... that's right. Because it's ""realistic"". Fuck you all.",negative
One of the best Bond films in the past few years.,positive
"Thought I'd rewatch this in time for Skyfall. Gritty, with Bourne-like action, it's OK as a reboot but I'm hoping that as the series continues it will regain some of the old Bond escapism and fun. And become more family orientated for the next generation of 007s out there.",negative
A great movie in general but not the kind that I dig,negative
calling this movie a Bond movie is like calling The Dark Knight a comic book movie its a comeplete understatement,positive
Really liked Craig as Bond. It was far more raw than I expected and I approve of that.,positive
"THIS is a great Bond film. Love Craig, Green & Mikkelsen.",positive
"Honestly, I didn't like this film. Craig is more like Dalton than Brosnan, the villain is just pathetic, the ending sucked, and overall it just failed to be a good Bond film.",negative
"Daniel Craig reinvents James Bond in the way all fans have been waiting for. He is physically intimidating, smart, athletic, and sly. Not like the Roger Moore of the seventies, who could not kick higher than the kneecap (although I still liked Moore, he was more of the lover and smooth talker) compared to Craig. Great plot involving money laundering to terrorists, Bond is given his first mission to find out who is banking the money, and bring him to justice. Best combat scenes in the James Bond series, it's great to see Craig kicking ass and giving us a new James Bond for the new millenium. He is the best Bond since Connery, and it is my second favorite film behind From Russia With Love. The two and a half hours of the film go by in a flash, thanks to the interesting plot and dialogue and great action scenes. Acting is also another great point in the film, and all Bond fans should easily welcome Craig as the new James Bond, and this movie is what we have been waiting for for over a decade. Loved it.",positive
Seems like the impossible play of slow-rolled straight flush that Bond played becomes possible compared to the die-hards he'd been suffering,positive
"Not what I like in a Bond flick, but nonetheless an adrenaline rush (really surprising given the centrality of the card game). It couldn't be more obvious that the villain is the guy you bleeds from his eyes. Craig is a much more visceral Bond, but lacking in the charm department. Unlike its follow-up, I really enjoyed Casino Royale.",positive
"Craig is the best bond since Sean Connery. Great action, and a wonderful story.",positive
Don't like the new ones,negative
4 stars. View count so far: 3,positive
A wonderfully filmed movie. You'd just be out of your seat in seconds after the movie starts. Daniel Craig steals the show.,positive
daniel craig is good as bond but the film is too gritty for its own good and doesnt have the cheeky chappy bond all us fans remember and love (Sean Connery),negative
Bond trying to copy Bourne!,negative
"Casino Royale"" has to be the best Bond movie ever, starring the BEST BOND ever! Daniel Craig is outstanding as Bond, silencing all the naysayers. He lends Bond depth and character. It's so refreshing having a real actor portray the super-spy. Mr Craig makes Bond seem real, with actual flaws and emotions. Brilliant! The Bond Girls are the only let-down, Eva Green is UGLY and Caterina Murino an AWFUL actress, but this is the only flaw that the movie has and I'm willing to forgive, mainly because of Daniel Craig's performance and the appearance of Jeffrey Wright, one of my favourite actors.",positive
"I just watched this again. At first, I wasn't sure how I felt about Bond losing his edge to the girl in this one. Bond's not supposed to be a one woman man...and is definitley not vulnerable. But actually women have always been his biggest weakness so it was only a matter of time... This was good old fashioned gritty Bond with one hell of a sexy upgrade in Daniel Craig! All in all, I think it's right up there as one of the best 007 movies.",positive
I tried. I really did. But I just got too bloody bored watching this movie.,negative
wow one of the best Bond movies to date,positive
i had trouble following this movie.,negative
He's no doubt the best of all the bonds ...,positive
"liked this one more than quantum of solace. the parkour action is unbelievable. the touch of emmotional value when he's ready to quit as 007 agent for a girl is nice. action is full to the max, as always.",negative
"More action, more suspence, more drama, more Bond. This remake of the first 007 movie is a much needed upgrade in the famous franchise. Casino Royale serves as a prequel to the Bond films, starting with his first step to being a '00', to his mission where he and his sexy partner (Eva Green) go to a tropical resort in a hotel to win a high-stakes poker tourniment against a banker giving money to terrorists. It's your basic ""spy beating the terrorist connections"" story, but with an even heavier, more realistic feel that drives the suspence. This is the most mature Bond movie out there with a different kind of feel. This is definitely not a bad thing when it comes down to the more frightening violent scenes. Daniel Craig makes for a great James Bond. He doesn't exactly meet the suductive, sex machine quality of most Bonds, but this is a prequel, remember. Daniel Craig plays it hard and mysterious, which is a side to James Bond that fits the most and makes for a perfect attitude for a spy thriller. The action in this movie is some of the best action scenes I have ever seen. And they just keep coming too. From the fighting to the casing, the action in this movie is intence, brutal, and very memorable. These are scenes that you just can't get enough of. And best of all, they don't need ""shaky-cam"" to be thrilling. Casino Royale's suspence comes from well written, well choriographed filming, and a top notch soundtrack. Where previous Bond films can be enjoyed for it's campyness, memorable scenes, and Sean Connery, this new 007 is made for the 21st century using new filming tactics and a well written story that puts this movie as one of the, if not, THE best James Bond film to date.",positive
"I do not like Daniel Craig as bond and I could not get over that the entire movie. Secondly, stupid plot. Otherwise decent movie.",negative
"Screw Bond, I want to be Daniel Craig when I grow up. Craig IS the best Bond. End of Story. This movie is so raw! Never a dull moment, from the title sequence to the credits.",positive
"*Films Owned On DVD* No doubt in my mind that Casino Royale is the best James Bond movie ever made. It successfully throws all cartoonish material that plagued the previous Bond films away and executes a more realistic, convincing reboot to bring new life into the series. This film may be over two hours, but it's really worth every minute as it features a storyline that's interesting and very engaging. Complete with stunning action sequences and a new hot Bond girl as a nice bonus. Daniel Craig is also perfect casting as Bond as he makes the character a lot more serious and very interesting and is even considered better than Sean Connery in the role and I couldn't agree more. Overall, this is a fantastic Bond movie and one of the best of 2006.",positive
"I wasn't keen on the idea of rebooting the series, but to be fair the way the awful Die Another Day turned out a reboot of the series was crucial. People who haven't read the books seem to think Bond is some perfect agent - always suave, always dignified, always with a debonair quip at the ready. When actually he's complex, cynical and cruel. He's intensely physical, he makes mistakes, he gets beaten up regularly and brutally. The franchise, with its mega special effects has come a million miles from the book's Bond, and while I don't think the books should be the ultimate authority here, I reckon that bringing a bit of Fleming's realism to the franchise was a breath of fresh air. Casino Royale is a different approach to the whole Bond world. No ridiculous world-saving plots, no ridiculous villains, no over the top CGI scenes and no more of that cartoonish mess that the Brosnan pictures had descended into. In fact there is not many actions scenes in the whole film, although when they come they are some of the best put on film in awhile (thought, Bond crashing through the wall during the construction site chase scene was a bit over the top). Craig was an excellent choice and a welcome replacement for Brosnan, who I didn't think was half bad himself, and dare I say he's in the same league as Connery (although not quite as good). I actually thought the Bond girl was good too, she brings intelligence (and genuine intelligence, not Denise Richards nuclear physicist intelligence) and spunk to her role. It was nice to see Fleming's ruthless, sociopathic government agent, the ""Blunt instrument"" of the government as Fleming described him, finally make his way to the big screen. The story was good and I enjoyed how it showed restraint and felt like more of a real espionage thriller, instead of a mindless gadget/megalomaniac villain fest. The set locations were beautiful, the set pieces well done and Mads Mikkelsen made a killer villain. The only real issue I had was that the film was a little clunky and melodramatic towards the end, mostly due to its length and the nature of what they were trying to present. Hearing Bond say, ""I love you"" to a woman was pretty disconcerting and didn't make me feel very well. Also, the pacing felt a bit uneven towards the finale, and it had too much product placement. In a few words, Casino Royale is somewhat similar to Batman Begins: a good resurrection of a popular character that had fallen into the realm of self-parody, but has some third act problems (or in the case of Casino, fourth act problems). So overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit. It's definitely the first time that I'm looking forward to future Bond films!",positive
"""Casino Royale"" successfully reboots the series with intense action sequences and a fantastic, dramatic storyline. While this Bond ushers in the mordern era, Daniel Craig is handsome and emotionally damaged in ways previous Bond portrayls never explored, except for Dalton. To the opening parkour chase to intense poker scenes with a terriost banker to the complex love story with Vesper, ""Casino Royale"" is the beginning of a new direction for this old spy series.",positive
"The new bond in my opinon the best ever. Daniel Craig is a strong motivated actor with the real bond expressions and drive. He's shows true strength that the other bonds dare to compare. Ian flemmings first bond book has the plot for his role. With strong scenes like the torture scene which made me cringe to the brink of my seat. With many betrayings by the ""bond girl"". The action sequences are amazing that keep you waiting to see what happens to both actors in the end including in the first 30 minutes the action gets you going and keeps you going. This is the best bond film to date a must see fir anyone.",positive
"2006's <i>Casino Royale</i> marked a reboot for the <i>James Bond</i> franchise. Not connected plot-wise to any of the previous <i>Bond</i> films, <i>Casino Royale</i> allowed for a recreation of Bond as a character, and allowed another chance to witness an inexperienced 007. He doesn't even begin the film as a ""double-0 agent"". This is how early in Bond's career we start off with. He quickly gains double-0 status however, despite almost losing it minutes later following one of the most action-packed chase sequences I can remember. He messes up during this scene though, potentially compromising both himself and the organization that he works for. While on a forced vacation, Bond (played this time by Daniel Craig) discovers a man who was working with a well-known criminal, Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen). Things go wrong after tailing this man, and Bond is soon forced to stop an attempted bombing of a brand new model of aircraft. After this frantic action scene, we learn that in order to stop Le Chiffre, Bond must enter into a high-stakes poker game. Bond's organization doesn't want Le Chiffre dead, but instead want him to lose his money, and then come to them to get protection. This plan all banks on one thing though, Bond needs to win the poker game. The actual poker game ends up having the most tension of the entire movie. Broken up by action scenes, (this is a <i>Bond</i> film after all), when the cards are dealt, the film goes silent. Hand after hand is played, and you can feel the impact of every single one of them. Don't worry if you don't know how to play poker, the movie explains everything important that is happening through its secondary characters. One of them apparently doesn't know how to play poker, while the other seems to understand it just as well as Bond does. He ends up explaining every important play, meaning the audience won't get lost if they aren't poker-savvy. With <i>Casino Royale</i> being a reboot, some things from previous Bond films have been removed. Instead of the often silly situations that Bond gets himself into, <i>Casino Royale</i> plays everything realistic and gritty. Bond acts more human than ever before--superhuman strength, durability and accuracy aside--and is a character that grows on you. Is Craig the best Bond ever? That's definitely still up for debate, but he certainly gives a fresh and different performance from previous portrayals of the character. James Bond, the character, is still learning throughout the film. We can see his immaturity in the field as it opens, and despite being highly talented, we do question whether or not he deserves to be a double-0 agent. We also see him improve as he makes mistakes; he's going to be sure that they don't get made a second time. With the added realism, we do lose the charm that made the <i>Bond</i> films different from say, the <i>Bourne</i> series, and yet, I think this is a step in the right direction. Prior to <i>Casino Royale</i>, the <i>Bond</i> series didn't take itself all that seriously. The actors playing Bond were suave, sex-driven individuals who made audience members, males in particular, want to be like them. They didn't have to work very hard to do anything, but this also made the films predictable and slightly boring. <i>Casino Royale</i> goes away from this monotony, and brings a new angle to a somewhat-tired franchise. Something else fresh with the series is the much improved action scenes. The aforementioned chase scene that takes place at the beginning is filmed in about as realistic manner as possible. Yes, there are tricks to hide how implausible the events are, but the point is that director Martin Campbell tried to make it seem as real as possible. The chase is a man who has extensively trained in parkour--free running, overcoming all obstacles that the person meets. Bond may not have such training, plowing through objects instead of avoiding them, but he manages to stay close enough to his target throughout the chase to make it an entertaining one. Seeing this chase scene again after watching the rest of the movie makes it have an even greater impact. <i>Casino Royale</i> has characters that you sympathize with, Bond included. Seeing a more human Bond doing these amazing stunts certainly leaves its mark on the audience. He gets sufficiently beat up throughout the film, and since he does a good job making himself available to the audience, we don't like to see him in such a state. <i>Casino Royale</i> is a solid film, whether or not it is part of the <i>James Bond</i> franchise. Daniel Craig's portrayal of the lead is cold, calculating and most importantly, real. The film feels fresh when compared to the previous installments, and it is an excellent way to reboot the franchise. It has emotional connections, explosive and entertaining action scenes, as well as one of the most suspenseful poker games I've seen, real or not.",positive

not the best bond but worth a try,positive
"Definately better than the Bond movies preceding it, but thats not saying much. The action was solid for the most part and well edited, not to frantic like the bourne films. I get that this is supposed to be the film where james bond is becoming james bond, but still it didn't feel james bondish enough. The ending was the weakest part. I felt like it was gearing up for one big final action sequence, but I had apparently already seen it. The scene in the water with the elevator and the girl was weird.

"You know the James Bond franchise has definitely been re-invented when our hero faces torture not by a slow moving laser beam, or a pool of sharks, but... fast, hard blows from a piece of rope to his testicles. Based on the first novel written by Ian Flemming about James Bond, this latest installment in the longest running movie franchise ever, with a new hero in the form of one Daniel Craig, is a very successful and entertaining piece of cinema. Forget Pierce Brosnan, forget Timothy Dalton, and lets please forget about Roger Moore, this new Bond is the best since Connery, if not better in some ways. Our story begins at the beginning of Bonds career. He needs two kills to become a 00 agent and in a very film noir, black 'n' white style, we are exposed to that and the film kicks off from there. There are no fancy gadgets, no Q to dispense them, and no corny one liners. This is a totally new Bond, and the filmmakers have played a good move in this re creation and in their casting of Daniel Craig. He brings a raw, edgy and ""human"" side to the character never seen before. He shows massive depth and range in his performance and we see what really lies behind the eyes of the character. He doesn't have the smoothness of Connery or the pretty boy looks of Brosnan - he's rugged, world weary and scarred and that is an example of what a real life secret agent might look like, and an element that makes Casino Royale so fresh and thrilling. In one scene Bond asks for his favourite drink, a Vodka Martini, and the barman asks him if he would like that shaken or stirred. Bonds answer ""Do I look like I give a dam?"" The story this time around focuses on your typical terrorist, specialsing in laundering money and shady deals, but one who also has a knack for poker. This is where the second and middle act of the film kicks in. It spends a good amount of time at the Casino and on the game itself, which in previous Bond films may have been seen as a low, slow and boring point. But in today's world, where every man and his dog plays poker, it made for educational viewing. The actions scenes are first class and inspiring to watch. They are believable too. They don't seem structured but come together as if the characters are reacting to what's around them. This brings me back to the point of how the whole film has a very real substance to it. No implausible stunts or invisible cars. Just fair dinkum, honest to God action and violence. I loved this new film, and I loved the new Bond. Daniel Craig will take the new franchise into the 21st century and up to all new heights with no problems what so ever. Stick around for a while mate!",positive
The second best Bond flim behind GoldenEye,positive
"From the opening scene Bond can't stop being a badass. This movie was much better than I expected. It made me give the beefcake/TNT genre more love; and Daniel Craig--a few come-hither meows. His solid hard-to-read demeanor, his cyborg blue-steel gaze. There were plenty of explosions in Casino Royale alright. Right in my primordial libido.",positive
"Sexy, spy movie. Enough said",positive
Bond's reinvention is a soaring success. Craig's Bond may be a little rough around the edges but he's a man of action and a force to be able to physically back up any witty retort he may utter at the card table. The narrative is smart and the action full of adrenaline. It's an all around success.,positive
He makes an amazing new Bond. No questions asked,positive
"Daniel Craig's first outing as Bond is almost top-notch. This reboot helped silence the silliness of the Brosnan era, truly bringing Bond back. Casino Royale is full of great performances. Eva Green marks her place in the history of the franchise with the timeless portrayal of Vesper Lynd.

Daniel Craig took complete command of the new Bond in this amazing movie. A must see.,positive
Pretty good. I liked the poker scene.,negative
"Easily the best Bond film of the postmodern period. They intended to jump start the franchise, frankly one that had become a joke and they nailed it. The story is a little bloated at times, in particular the extensive focus on the poker. I almost feel as though they decided that in order to ensure they would draw a younger audience they included so much of the poker to capitalize on what was extremely popular at the time of the films release. The choice of Craig as Bond completely worked and I really appreciate the nods to both the earlier films and to the novels. There is a real connection to the novels, something really missing since Connery left the helm. The film is opulent and beautiful and ironically released at the right time. I'm not sure such an opulent film would go over as well in our current economic climate. Easily a top three Bond film for me, right behind Goldfinger and Thunderball.",negative
"He IS the best bond since Sean Connery, and this just may be the best Bond Film since... well... ever!",positive
Very action packed throughout. Great stunt work. Excellent chase & fight scenes. I really enjoyed it. Daniel Craig did a great job as 007!,positive

Daniel Craig is AWESOME as Bond.,positive
Loved it - ending stretched just a little - hope MGM finds a solution,positive
"In a series that is constantly changing an updating, 'Casino Royale' is a welcomed addition and revamp to an aging serial, and, honestly, the best of the bunch.",positive
It sure was a pretty good James Bond movie but Daniel Craig is definitely a different James Bond than the other James Bonds but still it was an exciting James Bond movie! It had a lot of pretty good action and romance scenes as other James Bond movies but the other thing different about this one than other James Bond movies is that even though James Bond and M were both in this one it didn't have a Q or R or even a Moneypenny like the other James Bond movies! But still it was a great James Bond movie! This is probably the best Daniel Craig James Bond movie.,positive
"a brutal Bond is waaaayyy a lot cooler than some ""afraid to be sweating"" Bond in all previous movies..",positive
"what a crock. The reason we go to bond movies in the first place is the gadgets. Daniel Craig is a Joke. Daniel Craig as James Blonde doesn't work for me. I give Daniel Craig an A for effort, but He's a miscast. He will ruin the James Bond franchise. He has no Charisma like the Original James Bond Characters that we've watched over the past 40+ years of the Bond History. I hope someone new comes along soon. I think that Clive Owen would be more suited to Play the 007 character at least annoying like Daniel Craig.",negative
"Reinvention of James Bond sees gadgets, comedy deaths of villains, and megalomaniacal bad guys done away with. Apparently, this is much closer to author Ian Fleming's original vision of James Bond; an anti hero operating in a moral vacuum.",positive
Don't like Daniel Craig but E Green is awesome,negative
"One of the best James Bond Films I've Seen, They went back to what everybody loved about James Bond. It was original, exhilarating to watch, and with its suspense and perfect action, it is a spectacular cinema achievement.",positive
"Daniel Craig's first outing as super-spy James Bond is definitely grittier and less playful than many of the previous 20 (!) Bond films. Craig's Bond is a new agent, attaining ""00"" status (licenced to kill) in the opening sequence. This re-boot of the Bond franchise delves into the mindset of the professional spy, the need to trust no one and to remain emotionally detached. Craig's character learns this lesson in a brutally hard way in this film that is loaded with fantastic foot chases and fight scenes. Very few of the gadgets that made previous Bond films almost campy. This is a modern action film that breaks from the Bond legacy in turns of camera work, pacing, use of humour, and so much more. This film even makes a high-stakes poker game exciting! I look forward to more of this kind of Bond.",positive
a pretty good james bond film.,negative
"Daniel Craig is the best Bond and Casino Royale is the best Bond film ever. It's not full of outlandish gadgets such as rocket launchers coming out of car hoods. It also has realistic fight sequences the others lack and actual character depth. It drags a bit towards the middle but all in all, a very entertaining movie worthy of the 2+ hours.",positive

"best Bond movie ever, period.",positive
"Rebooted and revitalised. Casino Royale has kicked life back in the Bond franchise which was looking quite tired in Pierce Brosnan's last outing as Bond, Die Another Day. Daniel Craig is fantastic as James Bond, bringing him into the 21st century and creating a character that's as 'hard-as-nails' as well as vulnerable, a quality that has been missing in many of the most recent Bond films. The film takes the franchise back to its roots, the opening scene showing Bond earning his license to kill, with the rest of the film following his first mission after this. Casino Royale does away with the Bond gadgets and a big car-chase scene, both main parts of previous Bond films, thus creating a film that is much more believable and realistic than its' predecessors. Even with added realism this Bond film still has comedic moments, with Craig able to carry off dry-wit very well. Scenes are very well filmed by director Martin Campbell too, smooth camera during the fight scenes not allowing for any action to be missed. The Poker scenes at Casino Royale itself are also brilliantly well done, creating great amounts of suspense that carry the film through moments where in other films you would get bored. Craig's performance also gives the film an emotional depth that possibly hasn't been seen in a Bond film since 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. Other excellent performances include the always brilliant Judi Dench as M, and Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre, who is a very convincing Bond villain and probably one of the best for years. With the removal of the silliness that has plagued Bond for years, Casino Royale becomes more than just another Bond film; it could have easily held its own as a new film series, as opposed to only being successful because of the James Bond franchise name. I hope that Bond films are kept similar to this in the future, rather than reverting to the franchise's old ways, and I would be very happy to see Craig continue in the role for many years to come.",positive
the perfect James Bond replacement.,negative
Basic Bond 101 with the best actor to play Bond who is not Sean Connery.,positive
"""Casino Royale"" is my favorite James Bond picture. It's classy, action packed, realistic, emotional, and well written. It features a near perfect balance of character development, mythology, action and mystery. What I like most about ""Casino Royale"" is how old fashioned it all feels. Plain and simple, one of the best spy films around featuring a standout performance from Daniel Craig.",positive

"Suprisingly good debut for Daniel Craig's Bond- he plays it cool with a touch of arrogance that makes the character all the more real. Eva Green is great in it, and not just as eye candy as with a lot of Bond girls. The first sequence is amazing, then they top that with a parkour-style chase which ranks among one of the best action sequences ever",positive
"Vesper Lynd: Am I going to have a problem with you, Mr. Bond? James Bond: No, don't worry, you're not my type. Vesper Lynd: Smart? James Bond: Single. Martin Campbell directs the 21st film adaptation of the 007 franchise, which marks Daniel Craig's debut as James Bond and plays him against a corrupt financier in a showdown of Texas Hold 'Em. Gone are the campy Pierce Brosnan James Bond films; Casino Royale is not only an excellent James Bond spy film, but a damned good film in general. The opening scene alone is evident of the series apparent new shift from campy to visceral, as Bond engages in a stunt filled chase of a bad guy that is one of the most memorable parkour scenes i'v had the pleasure to view on the big screen. As an action picture, Casino Royale lives up to it's name. Yet despite all the action, the performances here are fantastically varied. Indeed, the characters in this Bond film seem more human than usual, even Bond displayed a varied palette of emotion. With Casino Royale shifting the James Bond timeline back to before he received double O status, Royale manages to shift the series back into relevance, one of if not THE best action film of 2006.",positive
i think the new actor in this movie portrayed it well . He has the guts to be the next 007,positive

"Jump into the modern world of James Bond! Find out how good exactly is his pokerface! An entertaining movie with a great soundtrack - especially the theme tune by Chris Cornell. Some elements never change in Bond movies, but personally I was not so fond of some of the new gadgets. I mean, a glove-compartment-fitted self-defibrillator. Not every car comes with one =D. And after being brought back to life you're perfectly fit to return to the poker table if you want to.",positive

"Begging for a sequel, Casino Royale delivers a new, more grim version of James Bond. Containing all the common Bond ingredients like car chase scenes, shootouts, fights and love scenes, Daniel Craig is now a Bond force to be reckoned with.",positive
"Casino Royale accomplishes the daunting task of reinventing James Bond while retaing the feel and image of Bond films that everyone has come to love. It all starts with the casting of Daniel Craig as James Bond. Prior to seeing this movie I would've never thought of Craig as being a good idea to play James Bond. But good acting always beats out being a ""good fit"" and Craig embodies the character Ian Flemming created while expanding emotions further than any previous portrayal has. Every other aspect of Casino Royale is an improvement on previous Bond films. The fights are better choreagraphed, more realistic and more intense. The poker game provides just as much intesity and suspense in an intelligent and refreshing way. The villians are less ridiculous. The only real flaw with the movie is the end. I understand that it's setting up the sequel and there's nothing wrong with that. What's bad about it is the transition is rough, not entirely coherent and generally lacks the intelligence that made the rest of the movie so good.",positive
"ohh..don't get me start- ed on daniel Craig, I love the Man ( trying so hard not to think the speedos)Anyways Great Movie, Bond at his best. And Not to Mention we finally have a origin story,well sort of. This has got a great cast, great action and awesome scenes. I would also Like to note That Mr. Craig Did all his own stunts, Now that is a true James Bond Ladies and Gents.",positive
"What a great reboot of a dying franchise... especially after ""Die Another Day"". This was a fun flick. Daniel Craig has a natural talent in acting. One of the gripes about this movie is the score. I never enjoyed the upbeat ""classical"" feel of the 007's... this reboot is grittier and much more hands-on than the other 007's so how come they kept the same music? I'm just nitpickin'...... and the poker scenes were just ridiculous, and still a bit too cheesy. Great movie nonetheless.",positive

now everyone will know you scratched my balls! classic!!!!!,positive
"You know what....James Bond is supposed to be a legand. He is always supposed to have his ""Double-O"" Number and always supposed to have a lisense to kill! He does not say ""Bond...James Bond"" untill the end and he does not say ""Shaken not stired"" No gun barrel at the start? I loved the car, and Eva Green is one of the best bond girls (seccond to Dianna Rigg) All of a sudden James Bond has never met Felix Lighter (who used to be a middle aged white man) Now is a 30-something African American. Huh? No Q or even an R no Miss Monney Penny? What happend to Roger Moore, Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan? They were James Bond. Danniel Craig is a good actor, but the way they wrote his charactor does not do him justice. Production design and story is brillient otherwise.",negative
"Probably the best James Bond movie yet! Daniel Craig is a harder, darker, and overall cooler Bond and delivers story, suspense, action, and shaken vodka martinis like no other",positive
"Alright, what a positive surprise! I had heard that this is a very good Bond movie, but now that I have finally seen it, I can agree! Daniel Craig is so my favorite Bond. I had seen the sequel (which I also liked), but it's nice to see his first appearance and know a bit better the story behind him. A movie with lots of ""Yeah, right!"" -moments. :)",positive
Must say I had forgotten the plot and enjoyed it like the first time: Daniel and Mads. Mmmmmmmm. Still good after all this time. The only thing I was missing was the regular Bond-gadgets. The medical kit in the car does not cut it. And why ruin that lovely Aston Martin.....,negative

"The new rebooted Bond is not as good as thre rebooted Batman, but it's moderately enjoyable.",negative
"Craig plays Bond as a live wire in this visceral and grounded reboot of the venerable series in the vein of Batman Begins. The film, stripped of cool gadgets, campy one-liners, and the burden of precedent is the most authentic and human Bond film yet made. It's a film about a man with particular excessive tendencies, rather than just excessive circumstances and sets. Daniel Craig fully commits to the role with a volatility and recklessness unprecedented in his predecessors, without ignoring the dark sense of humor the character has developed over the years. Bond is truly dangerous (and interesting) for the first time. It's also the first Bond film to feature an intelligent and somewhat developed Bond girl. Eva Green's charismatic Vesper Lynd starts developing some great chemistry with Bond at the get-go and is far from the female eye candy of most other Bond films, though she's no slouch in that department either. As an increasingly sympathetic character, Vesper forms the motivation for various pursuits on Bond's part and sets him up on a trajectory to evolve into what he might be expected to become. Vesper and a story focus on a pivotal game of Texas Hold 'em help the film develop an intellectual and emotional foundation to counter the physically intense action scenes. The action in this film is markedly post-Bourne Identity, the point at which the special agent action style of choice was visceral and more physically direct, rather than technology or weapon based. However, Craig's intensity and bloody-mindedness in the action scenes exceeds the shakily shot scenes of Matt Damon performing superhuman feats of precision. Craig's viscerality in this film approaches that of Russell Crowe in L.A. Confidential, a solidly spun, high amperage live wire. Bond comes within inches of life in this film, mostly close to the ground, no leeway or time to be concerned about achieving great cunning feats with the latest from Q and nary a speck of dust on the tux. The use of parkour for a certain chase scene in the film is a nice innovative touch, giving the audience more than just excessive shooting and explosions like in Tomorrow Never Dies. The locations of the film are engaged primarily on a building by building basis. Using a crumbling building in Venice, held afloat by pontoons, as the setting for an action scene is definitely one of the more interesting locations I've yet seen in a Bond film. The Montenegrin setting is slightly unconvincing, as its stateliness is very indicative of shooting location Czech Republic and seemed to be chosen simply because it hasn't been used in name before. The production design is appealingly grounded and authentic looking. No ridiculous Cold War scale sets or egomaniacal bad guy lairs are to be seen. After the Moonraker-wannabe bombast of Die Another Day, Bond is finally human scaled again. The visual effects are fairly restrained and are aging well. The cinematography is gorgeous, making this film look even more stately and important than it would have otherwise. The action is calmly shot (in contrast to the second two Bourne films) and the colors vivid and rich like the series' fun, yet spotty history. The opening credits sequence is a somewhat generic animation with a song by grunge god Chris Cornell. Violently ripping 007 from the languor and cartoonishness of its past, Daniel Craig and Martin Campbell deliver the most authentic and one of the most fleshed out Bond films yet made. Though perhaps not as imaginative or unique as the best Connery or Moore films, this film is a real story with real characters, put through realistically violent situations and is a breath of fresh air (and an injection of epinephrine to the series) as a result. (8 November 2012)",positive

"A very strong Bond film, some great action sequences and probably the best title music since Live And Let Die.",positive
The hardest part of the movies is the good boys miss your girls,positive
Clap Clap Clap Clap...,positive
Original was better made,negative
Everything that I love about James Bond all packed into one awesome film. A gritty yet sophisticated look at Bond as we see a young MI6 agent put on his very first mission. Daniel Craig portrays Bond as he should be: A narcissistic man who is more lucky than he is smart but is willing to get any job done no matter the cost. My personal favorite Bond film of all time.,positive
"A middle of the road Bond film. The chase scene was perhaps one of the best action sequences ever in a Bond film, but so much else was weak. I mean, Sean Connery would not have sat there while some whack job wailed on his testicles. And there's something not quite right about Daniel Craig - he's a handsome enough bloke from 95% of the angles he's filmed at. But every so often, you catch him at an angle where your brains goes 'yuck'. Still, it's better than many of the Moore films...",negative
I didn't have a high expectation on this movie but the outcome surprised me a bit. Daniel Craig played equally well on the action and emotional part. It hurts me when his heart was broken again and he put a thicker shield around himself again when Eva Green died. I'm looking forward to watching the next episode! (perhaps gonna buy the disc? haha),negative
"It greatly annoys me when someone watches this movie and says ""I thought Bond was supposed to be suave and cool and they changed him in this movie."" It's a prequel redoing the often boring same ol thing in the last few bond movies. Bond was starting to die..again and I believe this re-amp of the character was well done. He just receives double 0 status at the beginning of the movie. It's an younger more rough and rugged non martini, non tuxedo wearing Bond. Slowly you see him start on his road to the smooth talking classy agent that we all know. I believe a sequel with ""this"" Bond and actor was a good idea. A well needed reboot. Buut..I wasn't exactly pleased with quantum of solace.",positive
"Formulaic. Glad to hear the studio eventually letting Mr. Bond rest in peace (because of too broke!), for awhile at the very least. Actually, there have been already tons of much more upgraded, diversified, better-than-James Bond characters in the market, do we still need one old-school prototype for real?",negative
Craig has solidified himself as the new face of bond in this action packed thrill ride that is one of the best bonds ever,positive
Doesn't stand up as well with repeated watchings,negative

this is probably my favorite bond movie now,positive
The Bourne-version of Bond = win.,positive
"Surprisingly well done. Daniel Craig owns the screen. The story is better on a second viewing. Too bad Quantum of Solace fails to equal its predecessor. The non action scenes are much more interesting to me than the action, some of which seems to be there just for the sake of it.",positive
an OK restart to this saga... too much drama. Enjoyable end-fight scene!,negative
"Like a few other Bonds, Craig's best outing is his first. At least so far. He's easily the most ruthless and physical James Bond to date. And we even get some reasonable explanations as to why he's such a man-whore. All in all, a smashing success.",positive
"Ian Fleming's novel, published in the early 1950s, was a potent mixture of escapist pulp and down-to-earth realism loosely inspired by his own black-ops experiences during World War II. The protagonist, a novice intelligence agent known as James Bond, was thrown headfirst into a netherworld of twisted allegiances and triple crosses while trying to bankrupt crime kingpin Le Chiffre at the baccarat table. Steeped in Cold War paranoia and rampant sexism, but anchored by a knowing realism, this Bond was a far cry from the cartoon character who would become defined by Sean Connery and EON productions. A remorseless thug hopelessly in over his head, with naivete to burn, the central conflict in the story resolves itself without any assistance from Bond whatsoever; if anything the agent only served to prolong Le Chiffre's debt problems, which gave SMERSH enough time to track down and execute the villain. Then, naturally, Bond learns not to become attached to women, gets screwed over by puppy love, and the story ends on a noirish downbeat. ""The bitch is dead now,"" indeed. This 2006 reboot/reimagining/prequel is part beat-for-beat translation of the novel, with every major plot point preserved, and part bloated Bourne style shoot-em-up conspiracy thriller. Where before, the expository information setting up the villain, conflict, and stakes would be shoehorned into a 5 minute dialogue with M, there is over an entire hour of frenetic action with only the thinnest possible connection to the plotline itself. Le Chiffre makes several stupid mistakes right off the bat: wouldn't it be easier to make some insider trading buddies on Wall Street, or perhaps funnel some of his ill-gotten gains into Swiss savings accounts and creative investments, instead of sinking every last dime into a featherbrained scheme involving creepy bombers, African revolutionaries, and destroying a big jet plane on a crowded tarmac? If you must finance terrorism, should you at least take countermeasures to ensure no one can track you by your cute code phrases delivered via easily traceable text messages? Moreover, there are at least four sub-villains operating beneath Le Chiffre, which does not include the multiple turncoats working with MI6 (who probably don't work cheap). While this makes no sense from a managerial perspective, it serves to further Bond's investigation in usual procedural style: plot, clue, plot, clue, followed by a bombastic set piece. No wonder our villain's crying bloody tears every night: he has about as much control over his fortune as a kid blowing allowance money in a toy store. It's not all tedium, though. The parkour chase through Madagascar is exhilirating and vertigo-inducing when viewed on a big screen. Even though it goes on way too long, the airport tarmac chase gives a few nods to ""Raiders"" while maintaining a blistering pace blessedly free of shakycam and the laser precision of Stuart Baird's editing reduces even the most meticulously choreographed chaos to graceful fluidity that would make John Woo a little envious. So while it's violent fluff, it's executed with ample panache by epic-scale action specialist Martin Campbell. Perhaps 70 minutes in, the plot slides onto familiar rails and gives us an abridged version of the events of the novel, with only the slightest alterations. Naturally there's no more Commie paranoia and the game of baccarat, considered a gentleman's game but in actuality requiring little to no skill whatsoever, has been changed to the slightly more suspenseful and timely game of Hold 'Em Poker. Sure, it all boils down to whose two cards trump the other guy's, and all Bond has to do is hide his hand and show his poker face, but is there ANY casino game that does not require a significant amount of luck to succeed? There is also some casual racism that may or may not have been adapted directly from the novel. Felix could be any race (or even any sex; change his name to Felicia and you're good to go) and is ultimately a minor supporting character. But to complement the villainous African militants who deal with Le Chiffre, two of their thugs are sent to Montenegro to menace him with machetes (groan) and terrorize his white girlfriend. It's kind of sad to see Isaach de Bankole, a very cool and capable screen presence, reduced to grunting and swinging a dull machete for most of his time in the film. Yes, the hand-to-hand combat is a damn sight better than the blight of ""Quantum of Solace"", but there's way too much of it. If all the blood-soaked padding were to be cut away, ""Casino Royale"" would be 45 minutes long and rated PG, with most of its time spent examining the sociopathic Bond, along with his various hangups and insecurities. Daniel Craig brings a great deal of levity to this one-dimensional character, successfully stretching him to two dimensions. In particular his relationship with M, with affection for a surrogate mother figure expressed by affectionate breaking and entering, is fascinating not for his cavalier attitude toward authority but rather for M's tolerance of Bond's wanton rulebreaking. Anyone in their right mind would have dismissed their agent, and probably brought him up on charges, after causing the international incident in Madagacar, but instead M assigns him to their most high profile and sensitive case. Why? Because there will always be a need for expendable agents who can operate within and without the law itself, demolishing reams of red tape to attain results, to punish the guilty before they can disappear into the underworld. Because Bond seems to be the only MI6 agent with the stones to trample on law, order, and basic human decency, coupled with the skillset required to pull off complex and morally dubious assignments. Does this make him a sympathetic person? Absolutely not. But the ugliness of his work does bring a small measure of depth to the story, provides an interesting character arc, and indeed gives a sinister neofascist shading to the 007 franchise itself.",negative
"Sorry, but James Bond isn't a football hooligan crashing some lame poker game.",negative
"The only Bond movie I'd recommend. Daniel Craig IS James Bond. It's got some emotional depth to accompany the awesome action, which is pretty rare for these types of films.",positive
The best bond yet! Hardly or no gadgets involved and he can really fight than all the other Bond actors.,positive
"Bond is back, brazen and brutal and he couldn't give a shit if his martini's shaken or not. Daniel Craig now fills the shoes of the British agent and, as always, there will be comparisons to his predecessors. Just so we're clear, he more than lives up to it and stakes his claim as an equal to Connery and quite possibly the best there's been. Bond has just been promoted to ""00"" status and has yet to prove himself in the field. He's volatile and can't quite keep his emotions in check, leading to rash decisions and a lack of professionalism. ""M"" (Judi Dench) has been keeping a close eye on him though and uses him to his strengths, entrusting him with taking down a terrorist organisation who is being financed by the mysterious, LeChiffre (Mads Mikkelson). In order to prevent the terrorists recieving their money, Bond has to bankrupt LeChiffre during a high stakes poker game. Most franchises seem to be going back to their roots, realising, less is more. Bond no longer has his usual array of gadgets, all he has are his fists and his wits and when he's required to dispatch of his enemies in a cold blooded fashion, these are more than enough. That's what makes this Bond all the more real and believable and back to how writer Ian Fleming had intended him to be. If he went on going the way he was, we'd have Bond in spandex next. Thankfully, that's not the case and Daniel Craig's intense portrayal brings back the sociopath in our favourite spy. A little overlong - as Bond films tend to be - but when it's doing what it does best, it's exciting entertainment.",positive

"Despite the commercial success of ""Die Another Day"", by the grace of God, they decided that the James Bond franchise needed another reboot. So what better way to reboot the franchise than get a new Bond and bring back a director that did with immense success before. They decided to take it too a whole new level though and literally REBOOT the franchise starting by going back to Bond as a new 00 agent. Thusly we have Daniel Craig's first Bond outing as a young agent taking on one of his first missions. This marks (another) return for the franchise towards a far more serious tonality with lots of great dark and cold undertones. And once again, showing that Bond can indeed still make a great film without sacrificing its distinct Bond elements. STORYLINE: After achieving his official 00 status, Bond (Craig) is sent on one of his first missions to watch a low life bomb maker. Unfortunately, when things go awry and Bond makes the naughty list for MI6 he decides to follow a small lead. This small lead gets him involved with a little stock market treachery that leads him on a trail to finally pin some serious accusations on a black market accountant in the form of Le Chiffre (Mikkelsen). To do so though they need to strip him of some funds and MI6 plans to do this using Bond to defeat the man in a high stakes poker game at the infamous Casino Royale. With an accountant at his side in the form of Vesper (Green) Bond sets up to take down Le Chiffre on chip at a time. Too bad this blood weeping villain might be better (or worse) off in his connections than they assume. PLOT 5/5: Although based on the first James Bond novel that focuses on a game of baccarat, they definitely modernized this film almost perfectly to make it far more exciting. Updating it to a game of poker instead (really, who knows how to play baccarat anymore?) and adding in significant back story that includes more twists and turns and some seriously awesome action sequences they definitely did this film well off just from its more intense script. Adding to the fun is that they really embrace this 'young' James Bond to a T allowing us to see why he is the way he is with his work - why the man is so cold, his capabilities, and of course the source of his love of tuxedos and martinis. Bringing back Martin Campbell to the director's chair allows it to balance this seriousness and spy film like qualities while never losing its over the top moments that all seemingly feel far more realistic with him in the chair. The free running sequence where Bond chases the bomb maker into an embassy and gets into a shootout with the military could have been so cheesy and ridiculous but never does. That's the brilliance of Campbell with a good Bond script. BOND 5/5: Firstly, Daniel Craig is one bad ass Bond and a perfect casting for this modernized version (even if he does have blond hair). Although he never quite has the 'suave' that many of the others did, he does have this delightful charm to him as is accentuated with his on screen chemistry with Vesper and his odd ability to make his striking blue eyes seem both caring and completely cold. That's essentially what makes Craig a good Bond. He is able to balance the cold and the charm in ways that we quite haven't seen before. His young and rather defiant take on the character also benefits this 'coming of age' story well too and he pulls off this realistic spy character all too well. Bravo for his debut! VILLAIN 5/5: Normally, Le Chiffre would have been a villain that might have boring (he kind of was in the books) but with Mikkelsen's really intense and subtle performance and the film's build of his desperate measures and connections makes for a damn memorable performance. Many times I likened his look, acting, and almost untouchable presence to that of Dr. No from the original Bond film. That's a compliment. Not to mention that this guy weeps blood when he's stressed. If that's not bad ass I don't know what is. BOND GIRL 5/5: Weird. I'm pretty sure that they didn't just stick Vesper into the plot for the sake of putting a pretty girl in there. Wow. They didn't! She has a purpose and has a character arc! No way! Her chemistry with Bond is actually palpable? No way! She also has a nice (plot influenced) affect on Bond's character which gives her even more relevance and puts her right on top of being one of the best Bond girls out there in the franchise. She hits all the marks and Green's performance is torn and charming at the same time. High marks all around! ""Casino Royale"" not only reboots the franchise fantastically, it might be one of the best Bond films the franchise has seen yet. Campbell out does his previous high mark of ""GoldenEye"" with flying colors and all speculation that the franchise was going to drown again are sent scattering with this serious and realistic look at Bond and his early days. This is a Bond film that even non-Bond fans can enjoy and embrace. BONUS PRAISE: Its nice to see a Bond torture scene in this film. Those scenes were prevalent in the books and it makes for a highlight for the film (for the women too that get to see Craig barely covered up) to show just how bad ass Bond is that he can joke in that tense situation. Hell yeah.",positive
""" The name's Bond... James Bond. """,positive
"Craig looks russian soldier to me. He is like (as Freddy said in Freddy Vs. Jason. Although he said it from that woman.. but anyway) a dead bream. Bond has to step aside. He is too old for this sh*t. I mean, no more Bond movies.",negative
"Never was a fan of Bond movies but this is the best out of the ones I saw. More realistic villains and situations. Most of all, a more realistic Bond thanks to Daniel Craig. The story doesn't stray too far into becoming nearly impossible and the gadgets are believable. This is a side of Bond I wanted to see.",negative
Actually I never expected Daniel Craig to be a good Bond. But BANG!!! He is Awesome. No more stupid electrical things just a mind blowing spy flick. One of the very best.,positive
"As a young child growing up in the last decade, 007 films were really old-fasioned and unappealing to me. Casino Royale is the boost that the series needs. Not only does it appeal to die hard fans and the new generation, it does it almost perfectly. The action scenes are jaw dropping, the twists are nail-biting and Daniel Craig's performance is almost influential. Everyone wants to be the bad-bond.",positive
Great action. Great acting. Daniel Craig does a brilliant job. I like the whole thing about the poker and how Vesper steals the briefcase at the end. Great action. Can't resist watching it once every month. It is really great.,positive
Best Bond since Connery.,positive

"Bond is always Bond, and Daniel is definitely a right guy for a job. Plot is not that interesting.",negative
"This is my favorite of the Bond films, this one portrays a very gritty and dangerous Bond which I liked. He's still suave but to a certain degree not over the top like the other ones. The plot was very intricate and complex, unlike its predecessors which I have always thought it to be recycled from film to film. Excellent film, highly recommended.",positive
"I was/am very disappointed with the ""new bond""... It now wants to be Bourne Identity - like, and they didn't quite succeed. I like Bourne movies way better. -From a very sad James Bond franchise fan.",negative
meh. james bond is a dumbass,negative
For my money this film isn`t worth seeing..,negative
"James Bond is back and he is alive and well. Any questions about Daniel Craig's worthiness are thrown out almost immediately as we are handed a film filled to the brim with exquisite action and explosive emotion. I squirmed in my seat with delight as I have not done since I was a child. What ""Batman Begins"" did for that franchise, ""Casino Royale"" does, and more, for Bond. For a while it seemed that he might not be able to well exist outside the confines of the cold war, but here we are given an entirely modern Bond with enough nods to the original that we can't be too upset. Maybe it's because this is the last novel yet to be filmed in the traditional Bond manner and it is Ian Fleming who has stolen our hearts not this incarnation of the super spy. However I like to think that someone actually just got their act together and concentrated on the film itself as opposed to who they could get the most product placement money out of. Congratulations. James Bond will live on for at least one more generation, and maybe forever. Great set pieces and one of the best chase sequences not involving cars ever put on screen, blended with beautiful locations and even more lovely women add up to the perfect cocktail with the twisting story line acting as the lemon peel in the martini, holding it all together. Many will come out saying that this is the best Bond film ever and I can not rightly say they are wrong at this point. Only time will tell that tale. However every fan can be assured that this ranks amongst the very upper crust of Bond movies, and Craig is no Lazenby. He lends a harsh wit and a thuggish charm to the character and by the end he's no longer the new guy, he is Bond, James Bond. A masterpiece of popular film-making and the movie we have been waiting for all year. See it early and often as it is sure not to diminish upon reviewing.",positive
The best bond movie in my opinion. Makes it cool and exciting again.,positive
"Craig Brings what James Bond has always needed: an emotional edge. This time he's more of a person, rather than a subject for a camera to follow. This is by far the best written, directed, and most importantly acted of the Bond films. And yet it still retains that ""Bond"" feel.It has the girls, the superb villains, and the elaborate chases. You don't get the idea you're watching a modern action movie. You see a storied franchise brought to a new age. Two thumbs way up!",positive
"The ""Batman Begins"" realistic-gritty-reboot treatment for James Bond. Best one ever.",positive
"The name's Bond. James Bond. No, not that pussy Pierce Brosnan or all those other guys. The new, definitive James Bond",positive
"Casino Royale is the start of the new James Bond, 007 series, which is currently in trouble with its third film. Quantum of Solace followed, but Bond 23 is in trouble, just wanted to clear that. This film is an absolute classic for our time. Years from now, a lot of people are going to discover and love this movie. This is a huge breath of fresh air for James Bond, after Die Another Day, a total disaster in comparison. This Bond is fresher, better, and also a little more manly. The plot goes like this: Newly upgraded agent, James Bond, 007, after a disasterous end to his first big mission, is now onto a case where he is trying to win a card tournament out of the country, facing an ultimate foe: Le Chife. Along the way, he falls deeply in love with his new assistant, and as the road gets more and more deadly, and the tournament becomes more and more important, Bond learns a key lesson: trust no one. The thing that makes this Bond better than a lot of the original run is that it is a little longer, a little meaner, and a whole lot more interesting and entertaining. And it is also worth mentioning that Daniel Craig is single-handedly the best Bond we have had since the great sir Sean Connery, the very first Bond. Very, very good film.",positive
"An utter travesty (though I should have expected something of this ""caliber,"" as there has not been a good Bond movie made since I was born). Bond as a young, naive, and somewhat stupid agent completely destroys everyone's depiction of him as the untouchable hero, and the fact that the female lead is a total shrew and the enemy is somewhat likeable (even though the movie goes to ridiculous lengths to try to keep you from liking him) throw things off even more.",negative
"Daniel Craig is the drive of this film, and by him the almost 50-year old franchise goes over the top. Revisionist spy action thriller which adds human depths to a superagent and the film legitimises it with Bond's rookiness. QoS is a total emotional and actioner failure compared to CR. 007's potential is a tough test from his lover side and his agent side",positive
"I used to be biased against bond films for some reason, as in I didn't like them regardless of watching them, but I saw this film and I don't know why I was so hateful towards them. All I can say is this film is awesome. Check it out if you haven't already.",positive
"Such an excellent realistic Bond movie. It's got all of the charm, action, and Bond humor of the old ones. Anyone calling themselves a James Bond fan MUST SEE THIS MOVIE",positive
"Despite it's excellent pacing, fight scenes, acting and plot twists; it simply isn't Bond.",negative

"When I saw the first trailer, I knew Iwould never liked it because of daniel craig, he didn't fit in with the bonds. I watched the movie and I never got the same experiance as the past James bond movies.",negative
A good addition to the bond collection & the debut of daniel craig as bond. this was quite an adventure with a great story that explains bond's beginings.,positive
"Loved this movie, i bought it and the soundtrack",positive
"Hands down an excellent movie. Daniel Craig had some of Sean Connery and Timothy Dalon in him. And, he made Bond a real, conflicted person who has the abbility to care, love and trust someone in his life. This Bond also showed me that he is not, I repeat, NOT to be fucked with if crossed. The action scenes were just superb and Judi Dench as M is great as always. One of my favorite 007 films and one of the best movies of 2006",positive
A great modern Bond.,positive
daniel craig worst bond ever,negative
my rating is not about the movie but about other things related to it...,positive
"I cant even begin to tell you how many times I have seen this film. Being a 007 fan since seeing ""Goldfinger,"" this is absolutely the reboot I was hoping for. I had doubts when I heard that Daniel Craig was playing Bond, but now I think he is one of the best-definitely better than Pierce Brosnan. This is one of the few times when a film not only exceeds my expectations, but leaves me dumbfounded and wanting more after the credits are rolling...two and a half hours later. I was immediately drawn in from the artistic intro and opening song. I was not even sitting down for two minutes and I was already drawn in. That is a feat in itself. I have to praise Daniel Craig's performance as James Bond. He forgoes the more comedic, one-liner happy Bond and gives us a darker and more human portrayal of the famous agent. I loved the fact that Casino Royale shows us a more vulnerable Bond-the film takes place just after he earns 00 status. The tension also runs high, and at some scenes I found myself holding my breath because of the intensity. This movie has everything you want, and more. As you would expect, there are the awesome action setpieces and adrenaline-fueled chases you'd expect from anything with the 007 logo plastered on it, but there are also the intense poker games, which are actually just as thrilling as the action sequences. This film is definitely not a dumb action movie; Casino Royale is smart. I also have to bring up the infamous torture scene. The scene is so well done, you can almost feel the blows of the knotted rope. Now that is probably the most intense thing I have ever seen in a PG-13 film. Finally, I also have to praise the cinematography; it grabs your attention and really sets the mood and tone throughout the film. There is the infamous ""shaky camera"" during the parkour chase and hand-to-hand fighting scenes, but that is not a bad thing at all (definitely not as bad as Cloverfield; I didn't have to get up and grab a 7-Up because my stomach was queasy). It just enhances the experience and draws you in that much more. Casino Royale is definitely one of, if not THE strongest title in a film series that has been running strong for almost 50 years.",positive
"Not the best bond, or bond movie.",negative
"Excellent Film, everything about this movie was awesome. I know I sound like a fanboy, which I am, but having seen all the previous James Bond flicks, this was a welcome breath of fresh air for the franchise. I understand that we are in the revamp era of films, making them grittier and more realistic then their predecessors, and this film is no different, except that they do an excellent job of revamping the franchise. Daniel Craig is a perfect James Bond for this era, a rough ass-kicker, yet suave enough to fulfill all the facets of the character. The story is darker than previous Bond films, not as campy and gadget oriented. Perfect casting and an excellent script round out the amazingness of this movie.",positive
An excellent reboot. This one more then makes up for the awful world is not enough and the almost completely unlikeable die another day. Danielle craig is an excellent and in my opion the best since connery. my 2nd favorite bond next to goldfinger.,positive
"No offense to Sean Connery lovers, but the best James Bond movie ever made..period.",positive
I just love the style of new Bond,positive
These new James Bond movies have done an excellent job. Daniel Craig is exactly what one would think a super spy would look like and act like. Highly recommended.,positive
"Daniel Craig takes over from Pierce Brosnan as special agent James Bond, in a film that basically resets the series, set when Bond is first given his double-0 (licensed to kill) status. I have to say, I found it to be more realistic, more gritty, but (ultimately) less enjoyable than any of the previous films in the franchise: bring back the three Gs (Guns, gadgets and girls) that always made the cinematic Bond what he was!",negative
"Combining both style and substance, this Bond reboot is a success, filled with amazing action sequences, in particular its parkour introductory setpiece as well as solid directing, acting and story. Daniel Craig's bravura is put to good use as James Bond, giving him a great physical presence to go along with his charm and intelligence. In years to come it will be regarded as a classic.",positive
I fell asleep while I was watching it,negative
love this film 3rd fav bond film,positive
I do believe Daniel Criag is the best bond since Connery. Great performance of the entire cast and that includes Judi Dench as M. The film combines great action scenes with enough drama-suspense that keeps your eyes on the game until the end. Just like Poker.,positive
Very well made Bond film that will be a classic in the years to come.,positive
"Fun, funny, classy and a little different than usual.",negative
if you didnt think this was the best bond movie to date then your in denial,positive
Wonderful action film with amazing dialogues and a thrilling story-telling very exciting.,positive
"James Bond reborn. Daniel Craig exceeds my expectations. Good action, you won't be bored. x",positive
Best Bond movie i have seen.,positive
not bad for blond hair blue eyed bond.WHAT!,negative
"Mr. Bond began as the handsome,sexy,brilliant,daring,and very charming world's #1 spy. He may kill you, but dammit your gonna feel alive like you never have before. You'll have high status in Hell: I was killed by Bond! And you'll have a lot of company, too. Bond was charismatic. This new Bond has come down to earth. Mr. Craig's Bond is not charming, brilliant,or even handsome. He is a rugged looking blue collar Everyman, who has to answer to a fat and ugly woman for a boss; while his true love treats him as if he were a delinquent and from trailer trash society. Her daddy has lots of money, don't you know? Bond movies have been criticized as an adolescent male fantasy by feminists. Well, I have seen enough adolescent female fantasy movies to recognize that Bond is done for. Poor Bastard.",negative
Probably the best of all of the Bond pictures.,positive
Craig is now the perfect Bond.,positive
ahhhhh!best movie ever,positive
"Great Bond movie, but more because of the writing than because of the Bond. You could replace Craig with Pierce Brosnan and the movie'd still be good, except Bond wouldn't be this craggy ugly dude.",positive
"Sean Connery reborn? Hardly. Pierce Brosnan replacement? Yes. This is Bond before Bond as you know it. Before how I knew it. Pierce brought me into the series with Goldeneye....... but there was his last entry with Die Another Day. More like die everyday. Die now why don't you. Cheesy soap opera dialogue, nonsensical plot,( even for a Bond movie) and over the top gadgets. Where's the invisible condom Bond? Let's trade all that in. What C.R. does is give you something you rarely see in a Bond film; vulnerability. Not just once but on several occasions, giving us a glimpse of two men. The man he is and the man we know him to be. Some prefer their Bond as a one dimensional superman, coming out of any situation unscathed, relying on wit, charm and a watch that can control his car. Sheer force and brute charm litter this new iteration of Bond, and it's a welcome edition. We know the end story but not his introduction. If you prefer your Bond cut and polished and set in a white gold band, stay clear. I prefer mine rough around the edges.",positive
"Some pretty good action with a mildly interesting storyline. Acting is decent. it;s pretty well shot and does a pretty good job of drawing in the viewer. Any fan of action will love it, if your into the sort of thing that's cool, but I'm not.",negative
Fantastically fresh and over-the-top action! I was entertained throughout and loved the snarky humor and unpredictable plot twists along the way. Great set-up for the sequel.,positive
"might work as 'some action flick' or sth., but James Bond? Never.",negative
One of the best Bond movies ever. Daniel Craig is great as double o seven. It is dangerous and thrilling. An intense film with great twists and turns.,positive
Nothing like those other James Bond films. This one is good!,positive
"General Opinion: Casino Royale is another great Bond flick that continues the action even in this day and age. Daniel Craig may never be able to replace Brosnan or Connery, but he fits in quite well. Acting: Surprisingly enough, in this Bond film, the actors do a great job. All of them. Like stated above, Craig jumps in the seat of James Bond very smoothly and puts on a great lead performance. 8/10 Entertainment: While some scenes drag JUST a tad and some scenes don't quite fit into the scheme of things in the James Bond world, it's still a very entertaining movie. With epic chases, gun fights, disturbing deaths, and intense poker-playing, Casino Royale delivers quite nicely on the entertainment side of things. 8/10 Plot: The plot seems a bit typical of a James Bond film, or any action film for that matter. Bad guy wants money, tries to kill James Bond in the process, bad guy dies. However, if you read between the lines, you will definitely find a bit more depth in this film. 6/10 Replay Value: While I don't think I could watch this film more than the other Bond flicks, it still is watchable from time to time. With its long run-time, it seems harder to watch than other movies, but hey, that's not necessarily a bad thing. 6/10 Conclusion: Casino Royale gives a deeper and more troubling look into the life of James Bond, letting the audience feel sadness and also making them cringe at the sight of a man being whacked in the balls with a rope. Anyway, it's an overall very good movie that helps continue the Bond saga nicely.",negative
"Smart, elegant and very well written. Casino Royale is a brilliant Bond flick that works as its own film.",positive
Not too much action in this bond film but it was still one of the best in the series. The plot is excellent and so is Daniel Craig's acting. Daniel Craig is arguably one of the best bonds in franchise history.,positive
Disposing of the gadgets of the recent Bond movies Casino Royale has enough action and originality to entertain fans of the franchise. Daniel Craig may be the best Bond since Sean Connery. The only problem I had was that out of order torture scene. I mean jeez.,positive
For me not really liking bond movies this was awesome,positive
"Great movie, although I can't make it as 007 movie. Craig is excellent but comes in almost as some other agent not Bond.",positive
"Bond movies have always been quirky spy thrillers, but Martin Campbell decided gives us a new age action packed gut busting spine shattering roller coaster starring Daniel Craig, the best 007 since Sean Connery.",negative
the most emotional and dynamic bond film to date,positive

My favourite movie ever. 'nough said,positive

"Surprisingly good, franchise should be renamed ""movies about quite serious spy person"" - as this is nothing to do with James Bond.",negative
Bond as it should be - dark and vengeful!!!,positive
"A more gritty, imperfect and rough James Bond portrayal that is like a breath of fresh air to the Bond series. Daniel Craig brings something different to the franchise with his rugged and shoot-em-all style. The script is solid and very well written, making for a great action movie experience. The supporting cast also pull their weight with commendable performances with the help of good dialogues and acting. Packaged with suspense, heartbreak, anger and revenge, this is a classic Bond flick thats a hell of a watch. I thoroughly enjoyed this darker variant of Bond. Gone are the nearly flawlessly executed plans of Bonds from the past, the suave sophistication and gentlemanly fight scenes. This one is more realistic and definitely more believable. A must see for all fans of the Bond series.",positive
"Wow, a really cool action movie.",positive
one of if not the best bond movie ever.,positive
Once you remember this is supposed to be a new beginning for James Bond you can appreciate it. But after 20 movies this one fails to bring something new worthy the spent-time watching it.,negative
Spoiled only by having the wrong actor as Bond :),positive

"The most THUG bad ass pimp 007 movie so far .... Bond is ruthless, rugged, ghetto .... raw action, GREAT cinematography to catch the moments of action and raw intensity .... 007 doesn't need to be fully pimped and tricked out with gadgets, he just needs to be one bad ass mofo .... and he is in Casino Royale. 4.5/5 stars.",positive
Okay for his first bond role! want to see more!!,negative
One of the best if not the best Bond Movie. Good Suspense Story that is build up very good and goes right to the dramatic End. The Story tells how Bond becomes 007 too. It's very dark and Bond is very Brutal but charming some times. It's not like the last Bond Generation. Daniel Craig makes a very good Bond and I like him Second after Sean Connory. The Acting of the Movie was quite good and I can't complain. The Action Scenes were intense and Exciting especially the Opening Scene with the Hunt of the Bomb Maker. Effects are few but good sometimes a bit unneeded (like the Explosion of the bus on the Airport) but Thats ok. The Best Scene to this category is the Awsome Crash of the Aston Martin. All in all a good Bond Movie.,positive
"I really enjoyed Craig's James Bond. This movie has some great, intense action and chase sequences.",positive
"About time JB threw away the corny jokes!! And substituted it for quality acting, I like this movie because it was realistic and suspenseful. I was a little worried when they said Daniel Craig would play the role but he came out the best one yet in my opinion",negative
"Interesting for a new Bond, James Bond.",negative
Daniel Craig is an awesome Bond. This is one of the darker Bond films.,negative
"Sorry, I miss the suave Bond, the shaken not stirred Bond. Craig comes off as Vladimir Putin and just another hit man. Why is it every time a product like Bond, a tried and true bonanza personality .... these assholes figure a way to ruin a good idea? Sure this new Bond will satisfy the critics and fans who see no merits in the gadgetry and crazy plots, but the bulk of Bond film fans didn't want Bond to be drug through mediocrity. They want someone that is way beyond our time. This guy uses a cell phone. Thats it. Please! And the girl accountant. Now thats a Bond girl? Please, it looks and acts like my sister. What a disappointment. Tear out my fingernails, nail me to the cross, but this latest Bond and movie is just another Bruce Willis film. An utter failure on all fronts, Casino Royale has lost the Bond charm, flare and mystic. I plan to watch the Sellers version and like it. A Royale disappointment.",negative
"This movie does away with the stupid Brosnan esque gadgets and ludicrous plots and replaces it with a cold blooded Bond and a dark, thrilling ride packed with emotion and stunning action sequences. Craig is a charmless thug and I love it, the best Bond since Connery. Casino Royale makes my top 3 James Bond films along with Dr.No and Goldfinger and is one of the best films of the 21st Century",positive
Daniel Craig is an amazing Bond and he really is supurb in this film,positive
the old bond movies wer better,negative

"After ""Die Another Day"" the series needed a completely new slate (Not to say i didn't enjoy ""Die Another Day""). Daniel Craig had to put up with a great load of ridicule ever since he accepted the role, A Blonde Bond and other ridiculous crap, He was no Sean Connery But damn did he more than exceed the role, And Eva Green portraying Vesper Lynd, the Woman who made and breaked James Bond is as gorgeous as ever. Thank god the Gadgets have been laid to rest for a while, it seemed halfed the time that you weren't actually watching a Bond movie, Shots of the Action and Chase scenes are incredible and the Casino Royale Hotel looked Beautiful. Final Verdict: The Film Adaptation of the first Bond Story should more than enough exceed the demand of new fans and Die-Hard fans alike.",positive
"Casino Royale is a great action movie, but it rises above because of Daniel Craig's fresh portrait of Bond, as well as a good script.",positive
"blgh, whatever happened to sean connery or pierce brosnan",negative
This was the greatest Bond that I've seen in a LONG time.,positive
"Haven't seen a bad a James Bond actor yet! Daniel Craig definitely pulls off the sexy, smooth, whitty, cool and loyal secret agent...besides my nephew's name is James Bond! :)",positive
terrible... rubbish... not worth watching at all... seriously.,negative
"When you think Bond the first thing on your mind might be that everything about him is so over the top. If you're a villain you can't kill him, if you're a beautiful lady, you can't resist him. If you make a Bond movie, you can impress the audience if you try hard, but you will never surprise them. Same old stories are hard to tell over and over again hoping the audience will gasp with excitement biting their nails about what is going to happen next. However, CR did a good job succeeding in trying to. Having this in mind makes me think this effort was successful to say the least. Four solid stars.",positive
"""Everyone has a past. Every legend has a beginning...Discover how James became.. James Bond."" Another era of James Bond has began, this time with Daniel Craig taking the reigns as the super spy. Casino Royale is and has everything that you could ever want from a Bond film, its jam packed with loads of action, its packed with copious amounts of style, its unbelievably slick and sexy and it raises the bar on the entertainment meter. Let me start off by saying if you are a Poker fan, Texas Hold Em to be exact, then Casino Royale will appeal to you as it features a spectacular high stakes Texas Hold Em game that the entire film revolves around. If that's not enough then surely the breathtakingly intense action sequences will be enough to curb your enthusiasm and jack up the adrenaline. Director Martin Campbell (The Mask Of Zorro, The Legend Of Zorro, Green Lantern, Edge Of Darkness) has revamped, fine-tuned and recreated the world of high end espionage, and he has struck gold in doing so, as this is the best Bond film that i have seen in decades...no joke. Campbell and company take a completely new approach to the super spy and everything around him in this one. Yes of course there's plenty of action and loads of eye candy, but what really grabbed me the cerebral and intelligent approach that the filmmakers had toward the franchise, it was unparalleled and executed with discipline and absolute precision. Casino Royale is an elite film that's executed with spectacular smarts. It will take your breath away. The action sequences are brilliant, the cinematography is magnificent, the storytelling is intricate and slick and suspense is pulse pounding the entire way through. Daniel Craig takes a crack at James Bond himself and does a wonderful job throughout, Craig was meant to play Bond. His performance just radiates with near perfection. Eva Green co-stars and does great throughout. Mads Mikkelson gives a chillingly intense villainous performance. Giancarlo Giananni is superb. And of course Judy Dench rocks.",positive
"My Fav Bond film, the only thing that wood have made it better is some Bond Gadgets.",positive
Actually I think Daniel Craig its the best James Bond I seen. Great to see.,positive
Great - shame they made Quantum.,positive
"This was my first time with a James Bond movie (aside from trying to watch Skyfall out of context but didn't really understand what was going on) and I enjoyed it. Craig is great as Bond and Judi Dench steals every scene she is in. Eva Green is good as well but Mads Mikkelsen is just an actor I don't think is that great nor menacing. The score, sound, and stunts are all fantastic and I'm intrigued to continue",positive
THE BEST BOND FILM YET!,positive
Eh..... this new James Bond was no better than most of the previous ones,negative
My 1st Bond movie...was really good!,positive
"this is an achievment in action spy films. This film makes me happier after seeing it. Well acted, and sleek and sexy in every way possible, Casino Royale, I tip my hat to you.",positive
"A total surprise! Not only is this a great Bond movie, it may very weel be the best Bond movie. Truly, a great film!",positive
"I love the Bond reboot. I was afraid I wouldn't, but the new take on James Bond is modern and fresh without abandoning the original completely. The nods to the old films and the fans just make it all the better.",positive
"daniel does great with the role of james bond, he still doesnt beat sean IMO, but he does really good with the scenes he is in, a great bond film, probably one of the best",positive
not that bad but not my type of movie i guess...,negative
"It gave the newer generation an above average Bond movie, and Daniel Craig plays a good Bond as well. It will never live up to the classics, but it could open the door for people not interested in the older Bond movies.",negative
Best bond in ages!!!,positive
lacks the finesse of the Sean Connery days but great action scenes,positive
Daniel Craig Brings On A Great New Bond.,positive
Eh enough with the New Bond already,negative
Talk about revitalising an old brand......,positive
Stunning to watch but very superficial.,negative
So hat mir James Bond am besten gefallen,positive
"My favorite Bond film. Craig is outstanding, Casino Royale goes back to the essential James Bond and has some great action sequences.",positive
"Drags a bit at the end, but classy, stylish, and cool.",negative
So good it was impossible to follow,positive
its ok not the best bond movie,negative
"a great new take on the Bond franchise, using a nice blend of realism (compared to the previous films) and espionage, as well as a nice look into what makes a 00 agent, but its overly dramatic and some of the stunts become laughable.",positive
"Though more Bourne than Bond, but yet, Casino Royale is one the best Bond movies yet which captures a much more realistic Bond story, with top notch performances, a great love story, and a much realistic and vulnerable Bond as he takes on his first mission. Bond fan or not, this is a must see!",positive
Melhor do que eu imeginei,negative
"The best Bond film. I don't like the Bond films, generally speaking, but this one I genuinely enjoyed.",positive
"I didn't know I could enjoy an action film this much. Even the action itself was well done and didn't look messy. The only part I really didn't like were the poker scenes, even if it's possible to cidnap the watcher into the game in a film, this fim didn't manage. The happily-ever-after scenes were hard to watch due to that being the most clear way of showing that it's not over yet - which in a way, is quite... interesting.",positive
"A good smart action film, which there aren't enough of. It is a perfect counterpoint to the overblown campy Bond of old. There are no secret missile facilities in underwater caves, no lasers, no razor sharp hats, and no unfortunately named women dressed in garish colors. This Bond is subtle and gritty in an adventure that does not strain credulity.",positive
"Welcome back Mr Bond, best in years",positive
*** Good. Difficult to fathom why Pierce Brosnan was replaced. Daniel Craig is not Bond. His bulkiness does not make up for his lack of suaveness and sophistication.,negative
the bond bitch in this is not hot! Shes a bond girl for f sake,negative
"Love this man as Bond. The only Bond movies I'll watch, actually.",positive
"Never cared much for James Bond, but this was a decent action film.",negative
Really well done!!!!,positive
The joint best Bond of ever...,positive
"The re-invention of Bond could not have happened with another actor on board. Craig epitomizes Bond, not in the carefree, 70s fashion, but pertinent to the changed global landscape of today. One of the best Bond movies made, with the director who helmed a previous Bond reboot with Brosnan at the time (Goldeneye), right from the Chris Cornell sung titles, to the impeccably cast Le Chiffre, this one is one of the most engrossing Bond movies of all time.",positive
james bond was better with sean connery,negative
Easily the best action picture of the decade. Casino Royale reinvents Bond and for the better. Daniel Craig is one of the best Bonds we have ever seen. This is the Bond flick you have been waiting for.,positive
"A top-notch actioner. Craig is a great 007, the theme song is one of the franchise's best and the suspense levels are high. Campbell (""GoldenEye"") masterfully conducts an impressive array of mind-blowing action sequences - not of the loud, mindless type, more of the inventive, memorable type - to complement the simple but captivating story. It does end up a little long as the writers tease us with several potential endings, but even in those moments ""Casino Royale"" remains comfortably above-par.",negative
wasnt a huge fan of this one..,negative
A new kind of Bond. The shame is the sequel.,positive
You only need 3 words to describe this movie: Best Bond Ever! When I first found out that Daniel Craig was going to portray Bond I was guttered and very disappointed. A blonde Bond? I was always more of a Brosnan fan when it comes to the Bond franchise so from going from him to Craig was going to be what I thought a disaster. I was so shocked after the very first scene of the movie how wrong I was. The first scene itself made this movie great and then the rest of the film was just as good. As a huge poker fan at the time Casino Royale was the perfect movie for me and Craig now is up there with Brosnan as the best Bond to me personally.,positive
No..sorry...Daniel Craig just does not fit the part of James Bond. Sean Connery is the ONLY 007!,negative
"Stylish and cool continuation of Bond series, Daniel Craig is a great Bond.",positive
its disgusting would be good if it wasnt bond,negative
"I didn't really like this one at first, but I am being to see the light.",negative
"OK...I never expected Craig to even come close to Sean Connery and he never did. Craig delievered something new and I liked it. I am a die hard 007 fan and I can say this, the art, direction, story board and production allowed Craig to shine...not Craig himself. Oh yea, Eva, all I can say is this: thank you for travelling to the other side of the spectrum from Dreamers as humanly possible. Your a classy Bond girl now, so pick acting jobs from now on accordingly.",positive
The first movie I ever watched with my wife :),positive
I love this film! Daniel Craig is also my favourite Bond as much as I love Sean Connery.,positive
"Made Bond cool. Good acting, action, and story. A little on the lone side, though.",negative
The only Bond movie I actually kinda liked.,negative
"This movie was very well done, but had room for improvement.",negative
"if you looking for good action movie, then this one is what you looking for, this one of James Bond best movie, better then quantum of solace, i want to watch this again:)",positive
I will always love bond movies.,positive
not a big fan of james bond but it wasn't that bad,positive
Daniel Craig IS Bond. He's very natural and believable in this role. He's not dry like Timothy Dalton was or the whimpy 130-pound Pierce Brosnan version. Daniel Craig is the only Bond I'd actually be afraid of getting into a fight with since Sean Connery. Solid story and all the eye candy we're entitled to as Bond viewers.,positive
"handles women like casanova, fights like a ufc champion, drives like an old woman on her way get her pension.",negative
11/17/2006 One of the greatest films in the franchise. Breathes a breath of fresh air back into the franchise. Excited to see where the series goes from here.,positive
A break from any Bond you've seen before. Casino Royale is a classic reinvention of a franchise for the time in which it is made. The classic Bond cliches and tropes are mercilessly assassinated on screen making this almost a 'Bond for those bored of Bond'. Fantastic film.,positive
"[b]Casino Royale[/b], the new rehash of the series has been a great success, debatably the best of the series and the new ""Blonde"" Bond Daniel Craig has also been awarded with the title as one of the best Bonds. We must ask ourselves though, is that a large achievement? The Bond series is tiresome and very bland in my opinion; I have never enjoyed any of the series, and from what I have seen this is probably the best of the series. So despite the loss of gadgetry ridiculousness, it still feels like we have the old Bond series in the new high definition look to gain a larger audience. There is no doubt Casino Royale (2006) does a lot of good for the series, it gets a new 3-Dimensional Bond, a more 'cool' approach to things and a lot more care in what it does, but it never seems to be sure in its intentions. It tries separating itself and really making a good movie, but its nostalgia keeps pulling it back to the horrid series, leaving the whole movie as if it was 'gender' confused. The plot is surprisingly complex. Although Casino Royale does over-stay its welcome by a solid, thirty minutes. It does not stray too far away from past films though, Bond doing some smaller missions soon follows the far-fetched leads - which just any other cases is found through the stock market - to the larger picture, and finding the main bad guy. So now that he has found the guy he needs to kill, he for some reason needs to beat him in poker? Now I must say although silly and far-fetched at times, Casino Royale does attempt to give us a more interesting viewing. It does this by a few aspects, like not making the death of the main bad guy the end, although I think in this case that would have been well welcomed. The prologue and the ending of the movie are very, hazy. Why yes this is a Bond film, I think one foiled terrorist plot is enough for one movie, and I think after dodging a thousand bullets, they should not make him dodge another thousand. I think they over anticipated themselves, trying for a completely 'new' beginning to gain a completely new group of followers. I believe though a more humble approach, instead of trying to get the Bond series and make the story better; get a completely different story with the same character. If it was up to me I would end the whole series, and that looks like it is about to happen anyway. Beyond the changes, it still has the tiresome tricks and clichés, maybe in a different form, but they are there and annoying. Yes in case you are wondering, the female fatale still remains, and yes Bond manages to bang anything that moves. I think the series has been dealt with too many 'Pussy Galores'. Eva Green the latest conquest is a little different though, due to the new 'equal' sex world we have now, she plays a little game of Cat and Mouse, instead of rolling over and spreading the legs. This may seem like a nice change, to a degree it is, but it also gets annoying and predictable. The acting is quite solid. Daniel Craig adds a lot more depth to the 2-Dimensional character that is James Bond, but at some stages it is a misfire. The character seems to be caught between new guy with actual feelings (which is better of course) to the usual indestructible ego that gets a million women. The problem with all this is his confidence and breakdowns just makes the confident Bond have 'punch me' written all over him. While to go as far as say I despise the new Bond would be too irrational, I quite enjoy what Daniel Craig has given to the character, I just feel the work he has been given asks for too much difference in his character. Eva Green is the new conquest, a beautiful women she is. I find her extremely obnoxious though; she says no to him and easily resists the man's advances. Than all of a sudden she just gives herself to him, it just gets annoying. The support cast are nothing too impressive, just a bunch of people jumping into Bond's bullets. The bad guy, Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) does alright. He is not in your face evil, but that scar! He just happens to have tis massive scar on his face, they might as well just tell Bond to kill anyone with a scar on his face. Although there are no giant death machines or a plan to destroy the world, just a guy trying to earn some money. Everyone else in the movie are just wildly under-developed sub-bad guys, or just random agents telling Bond what to do. The direction, this is really quite a beautiful film. Martin Campbell has blasted this movie into the twenty-first century, where it has always belonged. We are given more than satisfying action sequences, and a lovely poker game. Therefore, Campbell gets it all right with the visuals and entertainment; the action sequences are well made. The rest on the other hand, the whole why he's trying to kill this guy never seems to be easy to understand. The ending also just seems rushed, as if nearly all the conclusive resolutions happen all within five minutes at this hospital. Casino Royale is just too messy and although it does have a decent plot behind the action, it is not told clear enough to fully stay engaged for the completely protracted movie. Overall, Casino Royale gives us what a lot people (including I) have been waiting for. Although it may be the best of the series, the movie seems to be confused on what it is trying to achieve. We are given a fast-paced fun movie, but soon it turns into a protracted mess, with lost intentions and the old Bond back, which we do not want.",negative
Pretty average.. This is the only Bond movie I was allowed to see... Not bad.. I can't stand Eva Green..,negative
"Love James Bond. This one was well written, good plot, and good acting. Much better than Quantam Solace. And I'll say it, I'm so glad that Pierce Brosnan is done. Daniel Craig does me just fine.",positive
"I recognize it was a good movie, but I have realized that I just do not like the character James Bond.",negative
"Talk about rebooting a franchise!!!! This is Bond as Bond was supposed to be. Cool, hard, smart and deadly. A great script is backed up with solid editing, acting and intensity from the action. This movie will be the standard all other bonds are compared too.",positive
"Great Bond film compared to the last few. which were getting cookie-cutter. Could have used more gadgets and car chases, though.",positive
Easily the best Bond movie so far.,positive
I don't like Daniel Craig as James Bond :-/ but it wasnt that bad,positive
"I'm not exactly a Bond expert, having only seen 'License to Kill' and a couple of the Pierce Brosnan films. But I very much liked this one.",positive
"My favorite 007 movie, great action, relevant modern day story, no gadgets, just brute force for a brutal enemy. James Bond is just what his Majesty needs.",negative
"After the dissaponting Die Another Day the Bond franchise takes a new direction with Daniel Craig as 007 James Bond. Although Casino Royale doesn't boast as much action scenes as the other Bond films, it is still another good film to come out of the franchise. Full of suspense and has a twist at the end, all I can say is Bond is back.",positive
"Cutting silliness and bizarrely stupid simple yet insanely complicated plotlines, Casino Royale presents Bond, the man, not just the icon, and shows us a rare glimpse of his human, his psychotic, and his vulnerable sides as the newly created 007.",positive
The first of the two best 007 movies,positive
"My favourite Bond film, if not my favourite film full stop. Classy, fun and exhilarating. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery.",positive
"This is probably the grittiest, most exciting, and most intense Bond film ever made. Daniel Craig is an A-lister as Agent 007, and Martin Campbell knows how to put his ingenious mind to good use for this high-octane spy thriller.",positive
"Great movie, but Craig just doesn't feel like Bond to me.",positive
"Better than its sequel, of course. Very good acting and violence level is very adequate. Moments of tension are very cativating.",positive
"I CAN TAKE IT: I know I am one the best movie critics on this website and I have seen many movies. I can take it when you start to yell at me and say how can you be so sure your awesome when you have never seen any other James bond movies besides the ""New Bond Movie"" well I am..... going to..... going to one day....",positive
Really cool action moive .,positive
one of the best bond movie u should go for it,positive
This movie was pretty good. It had great stunts and classic James Bond action. Entertaining and awesome. It drags into the epilogue a little but then it does pick up and have a great ending,positive
"Holy crap! Since I grew up in the post-Sean Connery era, I only have Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan to compare this to. Daniel Craig kicks ASS in this Bond remake! Great choice to revitalize the franchise. That opening chase scene is HOT!!",positive
"Bond is a legend, and this movie only added more value to the series of movies.",positive
I was actually really surprised. Daniel Craig was an amazing Bond and Eva Green to me was one of the best Bond girls. The plot was actually really good and believable. The acting was great. The only problems I have with the movie is that its a prequil but the technoligy was far better then the other films and M looks older. But once you get past those details this movie was great.,positive
might be my favorite bond movie,positive
"A perfect adaptation of the novel to modern times and a perfect restart to the limping series. I know its sac religious to say this: but Daniel Craig ties with Sean Connery for the perfect Bond. Connery may have established James Bond for audiences in his suave, debonair way, but Craig has embodied the essence of the brutal, flawed, and engaging Bond of the novels. Tight action sequences, flashy cars guns and hotels, and a couple of well placed wits retain some of the roots of the series. The gorgeous Eva Green is the best ""Bond Girl"" yet, redefining what that is supposed to mean by creating a strong female equal to Bond as opposed to mere eye candy. Mads Mikkelsen is wonderfully sinister and Judi Dench kicks some ass with her equal parts hilarious and intimidating, serious and believeable performance. This is not just a great Bond Film, but a great film.",positive
The best Bond movie yet! Daniel Craig makes the perfect Bond.,positive
cant stand james bond movies,negative
One of the best most well made Bond films.,positive
"Finally a no nonsense Bond and Bond film. Daniel Craig was superb as a gritty ruthless darker Bond, the story was great with a brilliant chase scene at the beginning.",positive
"Now if all Bond films could be as entertaining as this one, I would be happy. Awesome is all I can say.",positive
luv the 'anti-bond' attitude :D,positive
"Daniel Craig's first outing as Bond is almost top-notch. This reboot helped silence the silliness of the Brosnan era, truly bringing Bond back. Casino Royale is full of great performances. Eva Green marks her place in the history of the franchise with the timeless portrayal of Vesper Lynd. Aside from typical fan complaints about the film, the only downside is David Arnold's misplaced score.",positive
"I am a sean connery bond man, but daniel craig was a more realistic version of what a secret agent would be like, they would be highly skilled military personnel. this is far better than any pierce brosnan bond film",negative
"Definitely one of the best Bond movies I've ever seen. I mean, I really can't think of many others that really stand out; most Bond movies follow a very typical formula. Goldeneye stands out for sure as one of the best of the franchise (which was also directed by Martin Campbell). And a few of the Connery movies were pretty good as well. James Bond was never supposed to be this extremely smooth guy. That's just how Sean Connery played him and the other actors just kept it going. Craig is more like how 007 was supposed to be. Not just in his acting either, Daniel Craig actually looks a lot like the original sketch Ian Fleming drew for Bond. Anyway, there are a few odd little moments with the story, but ultimately, this is how Bond should be.",positive
"Hands down, one of the best Bond movies since Goldfinger.",positive
"One of my favorite James Bond movies, very action-packed with very poignant moments such as when the woman cries in the shower.",negative
The greatest Bond movie of all time.,positive
"On aura donc du très lourd. Le meilleur James Bond que j'aie pu voir bénéficie en effet d'un script tout simplement génial qui brouille magnifiquement les pistes tout en emboîtant parfaitement ses différentes pièces. Après les films avec Brosnan et leurs intrigues linéaires et aux twists pitoyables, ça fait plaisir. Et en plus on en prend pour 2h20, alors ... La réalisation n'est pas en reste, tout à fait dans l'air du temps - comprenez qu'il n'y a pas de plans de plus de 3 secondes et que les caméras doivent rarement être posées sur un trépied ... Je ne sais pas qui est le chef cascadeur sur Casino Royale, mais il dépote sérieusement et le résultat est spectaculaire ! Craig est parfait, sans doute le meilleur 007 depuis le grand Sean, et il est accompagné par une brochette de très bons acteurs. On attend le suivant avec impatience !",positive
The best Bond movie i have seen ever ever ever!!!!!!! the main reason behind this is.... that every thing was very conceptual.... there were no funky gadgets (though these gadgets have always pleased us) but these elements took James Bond to a much much real platform.... Now we can think that this could also happen in real!!!! unlike other bond movies...... Daniel Craig was much much better than i had expected from him... (even though i was critising him a lot before i saw the movie) The movie was best in almost all terms.... its duration was good enough.... Action was great.... And the main thing.... the suspense and thrills were stupendous!!!!! Daniel Craig and Martin Campbell have done a lot of Hardwork...... Plus Chris Cornell was fantastic.. You know my name.......,positive
craig is believably hard as nails.. he's not the bond of old... but is the first actor in 20 years to really stamp his name on the brand and offer it something new.,negative
my favorite james bond movie. i ddnt enjoy any of the originals,negative
That movie blew my mine . A bond film that have some thought in it's writing and doesn't follow the same plot line of all previous bond movies.,positive
"Casino Royale is the definitive breath of fresh air that was needed for so long. Re-energizing the series to a whole new high, Casino Royale is by far the best Bond film since the Connery years. One thing that I loved about this film is that the film makers pulled out every trick they had to create a tense, thrilling action packed film that truly redefines a James Bond film. What Casino Royale offers is a more realistic Action thriller, probably the most realistic in all the series. This is by far one of the best Bond films in the franchise. Daniel Craig shines brightly as 007. He gives the character a certain deadly charm that demands you attention. Casino Royale is truly a return to form for agent 007.",positive
"Whatever people say about Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan, to me, Daniel Craig is the best James Bond ever and this is the best James Bond movie ever made..",positive
Holy shit! Better than most Bonds. Only one to fully grasp the character from Fleming's novels.,positive
One of the best James Bond movies of all time.,positive
"The best Bond film ever. A truly fantastic film. It's brilliant, dazzling and unforgettable. A classic. Director, Martian Campbell first introduced us to Pierce Brosnan as Bond back in 1995 and now again succeeds in 2006 with Daniel Craig. Daniel Craig is terrific, he's the tough... read moreest, coolest and best Bond yet.Great stunts, clever tricks and non-stop excitement. One incredible action sequence after another. Great chases, great fights and great effects. Smart, crackling, eye popping and exhilarating. It's awesomely entertaining action movie fun. Pure high-octane, stylish, thrilling, unforgettable and pulse-pounding cant beat entertainment. This movie will take your breath away. A wickedly fun adventure ride. This just keeps on getting better. James Bond is back and better than ever.",positive
"If they'd made it a spy film without making it a Bond film, I'd have liked it much more.",negative
"Primu film din seria Bond care l.am vazut, cred k am sa ma uit si la celelalte inceputu a fost foarte dinamic, desi cele mai emotionante scene erau la masa de poker",positive
"The first Bond film I had seen. Was interesting, Daniel Craig did a decent job as James Bond, though not as good as Pierce Brosnan and others. I didn't like Bond falling in love with Vesper, ruined the movie a little.",negative
It was okay as far as James Bond movies go... it's no Die Hard that's for sure.,negative
maybe the best Bond movie,positive
That Daniel Craig. The only great Bond film I've ever seen.,positive
"Reasons to watch: Back to basics Bond, much grittier, Daniel Craig makes an excellent hard-nut Bond, more brutal, great Poker Scene, cars, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen (sp?) Reasons to not: The new, darker, more brutish Bond may not be welcomed into fans of the old suave, smooth talking gentleman we all knew, men might squirm watching the torture scene.",positive
I really don't get this one...,negative
the best bond movie ever made. A-,positive
muito bom filme mas não há melhor que o pierce brosnan,positive
He plays Bond greatly.,positive
"I am not a big James Bond fan, but after watching this movie I am now.",positive
"First off, the negative. Casino Royale is both too long and too short. Like OHMSS, there are moments when the running time feels its length and others where you think something's missing because they suddenly tried to trim the running time by not shooting bits. At times you'd be grateful for a little bit of exposition BEFORE a couple of the big action scenes rather than after. And some of the script has some lines as subtle as a car crash that stink of Paul Haggis' brand of heavy handedness. The big finale is just a bit too much, as if they're afraid not to destroy some big building again because that's what they always do. Having got that out of the way, none of that matters that much because this is the best Bond since George Lazenby thought he had all the time in the world. It's got a strong plot for once and makes it even stronger by showing us where Bond came from and how he smoothed away some of the rough edges. And the edges are brutally rough here. The killings are nasty and the aftermath has to be dealt with in a way Bonds have never done before. The real ace in the hand is Craig. He doesn't have Connery's raw star quality, but he's easily the best actor to have played the part. I don't know if the film was shot in sequence but for the only time since OHMSS you get a sense of Bond changing throughout the film as his cockiness becomes confidence and his brutality becomes cold efficiency. He starts off unlikeable but human and gradually picks up the Bond traits we know until he becomes more likable but just a little less human. It's an interesting journey and Craig is up to it. It's not just his delivery, it's also his body language. Even his fighting style changes as he adapts. Physically he's the most in your face Bond since Lazenby and the action scenes look brutal for once. Even the not very likely free running chase is spectacular but believable because you get the idea that this really is kill or be killed stuff. It's got a real feel of danger to it that hasn't been seen in the series in years. Only the torture scene feels like it's holding back (it's almost as tastefully done as the old TV version) but that's probably fear of the censors. You'll come out of this one not just thinking that Daniel Craig IS James Bond, but that no-one has ever played him before. Let's all hope EON don't lose their nerve with Bond 22 and bring back the sci-fi stuff and gadgets, because this could be a real new beginning! See it and you'll believe it.",positive
"Suprisingly able to modernize it's source material, ""Casino Royale"" brings Ian Fleming's first 007 adventure to life with a perfect mix of drama and action, supported by Daniel Craig's magnificent performance of James Bond's evolution from a reckless killing machine to the classy brutal secret agent spy the series was built off of back in the very beginning.",positive
only good for initial showing...then its just boring,negative
It is the best Bond movie I have ever seen.,positive
"Not the film I was hoping for. This is just a spy film where the lead character is called James Bond, no need at all for lengthy romance interlude.",negative
"a fair bond movie but don't know if i would say,classic",negative
"a very good movie,probably the best since sean connery back in the 60's.",negative
"""We keep on trying to make From Russia With Love, but always end up with Thunderball."" This movie is From Russia With Love and Thunderball in one. Great plot and great action scenes. This could be and probably IS the best Bond film ever made, it's not my favourite but it IS the best. Daniel Craig is a wonderful Bond, he's so good that you can't compare him to the others. His grittiness and acting. Hell, he should have got the award for Best Actor. There is actully nothing bad about this film. There is nothing to review and be critical, but the thing I WILL tell you is that if you are a Bond fan, you'll love this. If you hate Bond, you will love this Bond. If you want a good action movie but don't like the Bond films then THIS is the one you've been looking for",positive

"The third best Bond film. Truly amazing. I love Daniel Craig as Bond, and he is truly magnificent. It tops Die Another Day by 3 gazillion miles. It Brings the real Bond Back. No dumb actin or weird gadgets. It features amazing action, while still having a great script, great acting, and amazing cinematography. And stunningly beautiful Bond girls. Eva Green and Caterina Murino are gorgeous women. A personal favorite for me. Loved it. This was my second Bond, and this movie made me fall in love with the greatest film series of all time.",positive
Daniel Craig is my new favorite Bond. Alot darker than any Bond who's gone before,positive

the most unexpectedly fantastic film of all time,positive
"I liked this one, it was cool, I loved the poker scene best of all.",positive
Awesome movie...never liked James Bond movies but this one rocks!!,positive
"Its crafty plot,rampant action and some good on-screen performances(Daniel craig in special) marks a strong comeback to the franchise.",negative
great rejuvenation on the bond franchise,positive
Best Bond movie yet! Daniel Craig is the new Sean Connery.,positive
One of my favorite James Bond flicks. This one was great!,positive
"Bond. Is. Back. Only downside, I feel, is that the poker game seemed to be a big distraction from the fantastic characters and the fantastic action. Still though, best bond movie in quite a while and also one of the top action movies.",positive
I think I watched it.... maybe.,negative
I have never been too into the whole James Bond thing but this was a pretty good movie. Lots of classy action and decent acting. I liked it.,positive
"a great re invisioning of the man who is 007...skip the corny puns and one-liners, and do away with all the one-time use gadgets and go for the throat with an actual realistic character one can believe in.",positive
Casino Royal dethrones the bourne series as best spy thriller,positive

"One of Bond's finest hours, with one of Bond's finest females (Eva Green) ever. A shame that Craig's days as Bond may be cut short by MGM's possible demise.",positive

I fell asleep so many times and it wasn't that fun,negative

"Casino Royale es lo que muchos estaban esperando. Cuando todo parecia que no hiba a resultar, este filme del legendario James Bond complace tanto a los enloquecidos fans, como a nuevos en el tema. Este reinvento del agente 007 es hecho con gran exito gracias a una excelente actuacion departe de Daniel Graig.",positive
"absolute rubbish, james bond? i dont think so",negative
"Daniel Craig is probably my favorite Bond. He's B.A. classy, belligerent and...well, he's a completely different Bond. One of the reasons I think I liked this the more was the fact that most of the movie actually seemed realistic, as opposed to a watch that can melt an iceberg or something.",positive
Not as into James Bond as I thought I was. I do like the Daniel Craig version as he is grittier than previous (Pierce Brosnan) iterations.,negative
007 is Always a good movie & a Great Thriller!,positive
"I am the James Bond fanatic. Amazing Bond film, need more Martin Campbell Bond...Great villian too.",positive
I went to the pictures to see this and really enjoyed it. Daniel craig is a great bond.,negative
"Captivating movie, great addition to the bond series.",positive
"Can't think of a single bit I didn't like. Actually quite concerned that if I watch Quantum of Solace it'll take the sheen off this. And if Daniel Craig isn't your favourite Bond, then you Fail. At life.",positive
i love daniel craig he's so sexy and full of charisma,positive
"Hokey pokey gadgets, corny dialouge, and campy plots are what usually define the James Bond films. This on the other hand has intense realism, brutal action, and enough thrills to prove that this is the James Bond that we have needed all along. I've always ignored the past Bond films. They're all so lame, bland, and unimpressive. Thanks to Daniel Craig as Bond though, we get possibly the best James Bond yet. He is so much colder, quieter, and serious. There is no room to joke around with Craig. If you do, he'll kill you like that. The opening chase scene to a thrilling airport chase provide some of the greatest action and thrills that I have ever seen. Even tiny moments like the pre-opening scene, the opening credits, and the small moments in between rounds of Poker pack huge amounts of adrenaline into the film never leaving you bored. There is no denying that this is a full frontal spy/thriller/action masterpiece.",positive
"This is the best James Bond movie to come out in the last 20 years. Without a doubt James Bond is one of the most iconic cinematic figures. The James Bond franchise has had more sequels than any other film franchise in history. This is a prequel to all the other movies, Bond is not yet certified as a double 0 agent until he racks up two kills. After he does he is assigned to his first case as the infamous 007. This movie brings something that James Bond movies have been lacking, emotional depth, we get to see Bond not only as the super bad ass that he is but also as a person. Through some lines of dialouge we come to see that Bond has had a some what rouge childhood which has forced him to be though and guarded. This makes him more relatable to the audience. As the story progresses Bond is teamed up with Vesper Lynd played by Eva green, they fall in love and Bond who has just began as a double 0 agent realizes that he may want to have a normal life with Vesper, who seems to bring out the humanity in Bond, is want he may want more than the secret agent life. The shower scene is a great example of Bond showing a more compassionate side, as Vesper is still in shock after having killed a man, she sits in the shower soaked and with water bombarding her. Bond finds her and proceeds to comfort her. The Bond villian this time is Le Chiffre, played by Mads mikkelsen,he is a banker for the worlds terrorist organizations. Bonds has to stop him by winning a high stakes poker tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. Some people have stated that there are too many minutes given to the card playing but that wasnt an issue for me, i though they were done well enough thati didnt mind. This villian is well acted but he lacked some of the charm and charisma of the previous villians but i have to admire that unlike the previous he doesnt just catch Bond and tell him all his plans he actually captures Bond and theres a torture scene that would make every man cringe. I had doubts about Daneil craig playing Bond but after watching the movie, i appreaciated his performance and he brought some gritty and darker elements Bonds character. But Sean Connery is still the best Bond EVER!!!!!!! The direct Martin campbell, does a great job of pacing the movie as well as shooting the action sequences, where this time Bond does use high tech gadgets, but uses the basics his fists and legs. A great scene of Parkour action is shot in away thats both absorbing and disorianting. This movie avades the cliques that have plaqued recent Bond releases. Its a great Bond film and a great action movie by all means check this one out if you havent already.",positive
"I'm sorry to say, I'm not a 007 fan. And watching World Poker Tour staring James Bond for 2 and a half hours didn't exactly help with my interest. For the record, Daniel Craig as James Bond was not the issue. Casino Royal falls into the trap of being just another action flick with nothing special except having poker cards.",negative
Ok but somehow I didn't feel the old bond things....,negative
proves that bond can kick ass without gadgets,positive
Bond movies starting to get good again?,negative
"Excellent Bond film. One of the best. This is a sort-of prequel. Don't worry, it has everything a Bond film needs. They didn't stray from the formula and do anything sacrilegious to the series. But in this movie, we meet Bond just as he becomes a ""Double-0. He's a darker but more vulnerable Bond. He's extremely talented but not as experienced and has some lessons to learn. Everyone loves to argue about who the best Bond is and I'm not going to get into that debate but I will say that Daniel Craig did an excellent job in his version. In my opinion, and I have seen all of the Bond films, I think this one has the best chase scene of any of them. It kicks off the entire film with a burst of pure energy. Rather than going for a ton of unimaginable special effects, this Bond film goes back to basics - guns and knives and fists. Ok, the chase displays some miraculous feats of athleticism but the action is believable. Although a prequel, it gives a nod to its predecessors with ""all the usual refinements."" Fast car, gorgeous girl, tuxedo, innuendo, exotic locales, Bond kills bad people and saves good people, action, seduction, suspense - it's all there and it's all good. Highly recommended for anyone who loves Bond or anyone who likes their action with a twist of wit and class - shaken of course, not stirred.",positive
Wasn't sure how much I'd like this new Bond. But he's bad-ass and gritty. I like him!,negative
"Sir Sean Connery might have been the best Bond, but this is definitely the best Bond movie (I agree that the card game scene was a bit long though).",positive
Nunca pense que podria sufrir tanto viendo un juego de poker! Me encanto! bÃ¡rbara!,positive
Best Bond film of All-Time and Daniel Craig is the best James Bond ever.,positive
well it was okay considering it was 007's 1st mission as 00 and considring that he doesnt have any fancy gadgets to use its a gud movie with way more action with fists than in any other james bond movies,positive
One of the better Bond films. Good debut for Craig.,positive
Daniel Craig is not Bond!,negative
Daniel Craig delivers a solid performance as the legendary 007 in this action packed spy movie,positive
Fun if overly long Bond flick with excellent action sequences. It doesn't hurt that Daniel Craig makes a fantastic Bond. 8/10 (Great),positive
"best james bond, best james bond movie, enough said.",positive
Best Bond movie ever...,positive
"A raw,gritty, more ruthless look at 007. More along the lines of Ian Flemming's book, Casino Royale reboots the whole Bond series and tells the story of how Bond becomes a ""00"" and how he becomes that womanizing,gadget wielding spy we all have come to know so well. This isn't your Kevin Costner, Sean Connery,Pierce Brosnan Bond...but it's still great.",positive
"like the consensus said, this bond film is jaw dropping and will have your knuckles turning white. Craig truly is the best bond since connery.",positive
A movie about a sociopathic killer that works for a government agency and is not a walking pile of terrible puns? Yes please.,negative
"I do not like the new bond he changed to much the whole concept of bond is gone... The woman he always gets in they end are gone and his drink and ofcource his charm all gone, so sad about the change.",negative
Daniel did his thang! But he's NO Sean Connery!,negative
"Best Bond in years. Daniel Craig is one of the better Bonds of all time. It does action, plot twists, and car chases without the sex (sorta). The plot is the most interesting part. The idea of a bond movie wrapping around a card game sounds bad, but it works better then other simple type plots (think Awake)",positive
One of the best bond films. I love the crane jump sence!,positive
My favorite Bond flick,positive
I'd like to see it... complete,negative
"This is one of my favorite movies. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery. It was back to basics in this film as the heart of Bond that was so plagued by ridiculous plots, gadgets, and action scenes is restored in bad-ass fashion. As the opening scene is arguably one of the best in modern cinema it shows the young inexperienced Bond energized that remains throughout the movie. Action packed, emotional, funny, smart, and a classic. A better James Bond movie won't be made.",positive
"After kiwi trannie Lee Tamahori did more damage to Bond than any villain ever could, our hero is brought back in a film that manages to be one of the best in the entire series.",positive
"Excellent movie. At last, this character is played by a permormer that actually looks like a cold-blooded mureder, instead of a fancy dandy. Craig´s contribution is remarkable. Full of action, great scenarios and interesting secuenses, It´s higly enjoyable. 90% !",positive
I am a daniel Craig convert. Screw you Pierce Brosnan.,positive
The best James Bond since Sean Connery!,positive
This was interesting.,negative
Watch as hollywood remembers who 007 is suppose to be.,positive
"21st Bond film and the first to feature Daniel Craig. This is in my views to best Bond movie ever made. Outside of Connery, Craig is light years better than the other actors who played the role. There are so much great emotion and raw feeling in this flick, that just makes in unforgettable. Eva Green is hot and does a great job not to just be used for sex appeal. Great villains and great action sequences. Will go down as better than ""From Russia With Love"" and ""Goldfinger"" in the years to come.",positive
"I liked the 'back to basics' with Bond, it has a lot going well, just not well executed.",negative
Intense and Action Packed!,positive
A blond Bond! That guy kicks a...!,negative
"A wonderful reboot of the James Bond franchise. The prequel of the James Bond films. The first scene explains James Bond's first mission and his first and second kill then the course of the movie is James' first challenging mission. He did his best playing Bond and led the reboot to a sequel, Quantum of Solace.",positive
A decent effort on Craigs part but won't beat live or let die,negative
New look of Bond did it. Hard guy image- that's perfect for a secret agent. And Eva Green is awesome.,negative
Solid action flick. The Bourne films are just a little better.,negative
A grittier Bond that lacks the cheeky British charm previous Bond's have,positive
Finally a James Bond I can relate to.,positive
"Although this new Bonds personality makes him look like some sort of an antihero,Casino Royale really filled my expectations,made me feel the same way i felt about From Russia With Love,Goldfinger or Moonraker(Although they are way different than Casino Royale)this movie is certainly,one of the greatest Bond filmsever made. Some people just keep saying that Daniel Craigs characterization does not seem like Bond at all,but i think that it is a great twist,from Intellectual-gentlemanlike(Sean Connery/Lazenby) to sexy and funny (Moore/Dalton/Brosnan)and,finally;Strong,rancorous and mainly,VIOLENT(Craig)...Well,Bond had to loose his patience at some point (lol).",negative
"The Best Bond since Sean Connery! I like Moore,Brosnan and even Dalton! But there stories sometimes lacked and It seemed the series was caught in a little funk. It needed new blood and it needed to go back to Bonds roots and by that the Bond in the books! Daniel Craig is perfect for Bond and bringing back the Original style that was in the Books by Ian Fleming! I hope Craig stays on for 5 to 6 movies as the super agent and he receives great scripts to work from! This is the Bond movie I've always wanted and waited for!",positive
Didn't like the new bond.,negative
"'Casino Royale' brings on the thrill with its deep performances and complexity. Daniel Craig makes the perfect Bond. It gives me the sense of Indian Jones mixed with Batman. Right away, you sense the charismatic appeal radiating off the screen. I was happy to see that it wasn't as cheesy as it portrayed. This is probably the finest Bond rendition ever.",positive
best bond film ever! great return for james bond! best deffo in my top 5 greatest reboots,positive
"Big fan of the ""reboot"". Caught a couple of fun bits on this rewatch: Bond sending emails about ordering stationary?",positive
Great reboot of the Bond franchise.,negative
"the best movie as ever!!! but the ending was unhappy, so it was so hard for me not to cry....!",positive
One of the best James bond series I guess.,positive
bond returns and is finally given the darkness dalton delivered a decade earlier. was i not on to something when i said i loved the dalton films? this back to the basics delivers a film that suits the modern era with its demand for a sharper script and interesting villains. it is all done in spades and we are reintroduced with a character who has been on the screen forever. daniel craig is a bold and worthy choice for the role. i enjoyed alot more then the other brosnan bonds because of the darkness and the idea bond is a person not someone who is immortal and unkillable.,positive
"Good action scenes, Smooth lover interceptions, and guns. 4/5",positive
Cannot say enough good things about this movie. It was like a shot in the arm to the whole franchise.,positive
A great new take on Bond.,positive
"See...this is what happens if you use the original literature. Fantastic Bond, James Bond.",positive
I liked the electronics that are James Bond!,negative
"This movie was a nice comeback after the Halle Barry one. It wasn?t great, and some pretty crappy movies would still be better than the previous, but Casino Royale works for a new style Bond movie. I saw this way back when and caught it on TV recently. Amazingly enough, I don?t think they edited anything, and that?s after what was taken out of Pulp Fiction. Even all of the torture was in it. And that?s not really a spoiler as Bond movies have mean things like that in them. What was great about this Bond movie was the action, which the opening scene is amazing and very inventive with other action scenes, and the women, both of which were instant classics for looks and role/performance. What didn?t work was the horrible pacing and the purposely vague points, unless they were just purposely blandly written. Still good enough.",positive
Best Bond movie ever.,positive
"Now, THIS is one great James Bond movie! I consider this the true FIRST Bond movie with a real, not fantastic, James Bond. And Eva Green was just right for her role.",positive
"i read all bonds in the sixties and fell for them hard. Maybe i saw a connery-bond and thought it lightweight, anyway i was not interested of bond-movies: pompous macho scheisse! and then by some odd coincidense i saw this new one... actually it is not my type of a movie but it is so well made and exhilarating that it has been a pleasure to see a few times more. What catches me is the way Africa is Africa: the buildingsites, the incompleteness, ramshackle buildings and surroundings, and finally the rain and mud. Stereotypal? Oh yes, but so deliciously. Not to mention the Miami airport sequence, which is so american action, american action that it just could not be any more so. The chase with trucks and heavy cars...with the target an airplane. And can anything stop him - no, of course not! Stereotypal? oh yes, and meant to be so! And then we end up in Europe. Old culture, old houses, old Dalmatian coast, and a chase: Bond after the villains that have his amoreuse! and can anything stop him? The woman is on the road! My old european soul laughed out loud at this stage! and finally the venetian sequence, houses held up and floating with compressed air and even the elevator such an old metal structure!",positive
"Very nice, a classic 007 ;)",negative
Bond as he should be,positive
"A nice new direction for Bond, but at the same time, didn't feel like a Bond film in a lot of ways...I miss the the ludicrous gadgets, stunts, humour, villains, plots... well, the ludicrous EVERYTHING about the old Bond films.",negative
"I never would have thought of Daniel Craig for the part of Bond, but he ends up helping usher in the best Bond film in decades. Casino Royale manages to capture the essence of the earliest Sean Connery films, where Bond isn't just a wise cracking ladies' man, but the cold hearted beast the British government unleashes when they need some serious business done. Craig looks like he's always on the verge of erupting in violence, even when he's being charming. The film is exciting and fast paced, and doesn't fall prey too much to the modern tendency of shaking the camera constantly. Plenty of world travel brings back the traditional vibe of the early films as well, as we see exotic locations on several continents. Even the gadgets are toned down to things either currently available or not far off. Some complain about the extra half hour after the film's climax. But upon repeat viewing, I actually like this sequence even more, especially when you take into account the next film. When watched with its companion and sequel, Quantum of Solace, they feel like one long, continuous film. There is a break in tone, but not in story, between the two.",positive
"Honestly not a Bond fan (since I never watched the previous movies), but Casino Royale, in particular, is really impressive. Epic! :)",positive
The new bond is badass to say the least. I love this movie.,positive
"After the disaster of Die Another Day, it was clear that the James Bond series was in need of returning to its roots. So, out went Pierce Brosnan and in came Daniel Craig, a casting choice that me and many other fans were upset about. To this day I wonder how it would of turned out if Clive Owen got the role. But, I told myself to wait and see. Craig turned out to be very good in the role, something that surprised all of us fans who questioned him. In bringing the series back to the beginning, the producers chose to adapt the first of Fleming's 007 novels, Casino Royale. This is the first time since On Her Majesty's Secret Service that the film faithfully adapted Fleming's story. Any time a Bond film does that, it turns out great. Casino Royale is no exception. Why don't the producers do this more often? Casino Royale is gritty and rough, but at the same time sophisticated and classy. The action scenes are nothing short of first rate and the poker scenes are tense and suspenseful. Craig's supporters in the likes of Jeffrey Wright (in the welcome return of Felix Leiter) and Mads Mikkelsen (as Bond's original adversary Le Chiffre) turn in fine performances of their own. Judi Dench as always, is superb as M. However, the film is hurt by the absence of both Q and Miss Moneypenny. I see no reason to not bring back John Cleese as the quartermaster in some sort of role or finding a way to slip in Moneypenny but hey, I have no control in it. Casino Royale is the best entry in the Bond series since On Her Majesty's Secret Service way back in 1969. The modernized tone is welcomed for today's audiences and the use of one of Fleming's stories for the first time in a while is great. From the action, to the suspense, to Chris Cornell's spectacular theme song, Casino Royale is first class Bond entertainment that cannot be missed.",positive
"The only way to restart the Bond series... get someone who can actually portray the character as Ian Flemming envisioned. Connery, Dalton (Yes, DALTON) and now Craig have done the best job portraying the hard edge character that Bond is supposed to be. Brosnan and Moore added so much tongue-in-cheek humor to the role that it took away from the overall character. Craig is the only man to play Bond that could even be a contender to the title of ""Best Bond"" after Connery.",positive

"Awesome, just Awesome - Best Bond since Sean Connery...",positive
"""Casino Royale"" is easily one of the best James Bond pictures I have seen...This Bond film gets rid of all the cartoonish silliness and buffoonery that plagued recent James Bond outings, and Daniel Craig delivers. Craig becomes the character James Bond and I believed him. I believed his performance and for once I got to see a James Bond who actually has flaws, is troubled, and makes mistakes. Bond also shows a certain sensitivity. A scene shows Bond comforting Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) as she breaks down in tears. As cold and teflon Bond can be, that was quite surprising. The action is great and very well edited and the Bond villian Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen)is hauntingly cold, and it's nice to see Judi Dench as M again. ""Casino Royale"" is what fans and critics have been waiting for: A caustic, haunted, intense reinvention of 007.",positive
"This movie is by far the best James Bond movie to be made. It's got everything and more. The beginning of Bond. His first love and real love, amazing cars, tons of explosions, witty banter lines and Daniel Craig is an incredible 007! ;-)",positive
"Pierce Brosnan is still my favorite James Bond, but I'm pleased to say that Daniel Craig is the second best Bond. Unlike other Bonds, this Bond is more emotional, and that's a good concept for the reimagining of this series. For Craig's first Bond movie, it is an epic success. First, it's directed by Martin Campbell, director of Brosnan's first (and best) Bond film, Goldeneye. Second, it's has what makes a good Bond movie.",positive
Epic the first time I saw it. I like the mean James Bond a lot.,positive

"Actor Daniel Craig assumes the role formerly occupied by such screen greats as Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Timothy Dalton to set out on the character's very first 007 mission. James Bond has earned his ""00"" status by masterfully executing a pair of death-defying professional assassinations. Now assigned the task of traveling to Madagascar to spy on notorious terrorist Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) for his maiden voyage as a 007 agent, Bond boldly goes against MI6 policy to launch an independent investigation that finds him traversing the Bahamas in search of Mollaka's notoriously elusive terror cell. Subsequently led into the company of the mysterious Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian) and his exotic girlfriend, Solange (Caterina Murino), Bond soon realizes that he is closer than ever to locating well-guarded terrorist financier Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), the man who has personally bankrolled some of the most prevalent terrorist organizations on the planet. When Bond learns that Le Chiffre is planning to partake in an upcoming high-stakes poker game to be played at Montenegro's Le Casino Royale and use the winnings to establish his financial grip on the globe, M (Judi Dench) assigns beguiling agent Vesper (Eva Green) the task of watching over the fledgling agent as he plays against Le Chiffre in a covert attempt to destroy the nefarious gambler's well-established monetary stronghold in the underworld once and for all. Bond will need more than his legendary gambling skills in order to win this dangerous game, though, and after allying himself with local MI6 field agent Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and CIA operative Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), the endlessly suave super-spy puts on his poker face for a high-stakes game of cards in which the stakes are not measured in dollars, but human lives. Starring Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Giancarlo Giannini, Caterina Murino , Simon Abkarian , Isaach De BankolÃ (C) , Jesper Christensen , Ivana Milicevic and others. Directed by Martin Campbell who also directed GoldenEye, the 2 Zorro movies, Vertical Limit, Edge of Darkness and the recent Green Lantern. here comes the best Bond movie ever. i am gonna keep my review short. i have seen it before but i didn't completed it so few weeks back i saw the full movie and now i am reviewing it. Campbell directed GoldenEye before which was a nice movie but this was something i never expected from him or from anyone else. an excellent Bond Movie, a Bond movie worth giving 5 stars? that is shocking indeed. many of you have seen it but if not then it is a MUST WATCH. Daniel Craig's first movie as Bond, he did a fantastic job. i don't know about others but i find him so good as Bond and also he has great looks. he did a very good job and i loved his performance. Eva Green and Caterina Murino both looked good but isn't Eva Green like one of the best bond girls? Mads Mikkelson was a good villain. and obviously Judy Dench as M was good as always. Good Direction as well as very thrilling and edge of the seat plot. screenplay was excellently written. great Effects and action with great score and cinematography and other stuff. filled with good action fun. a pure adrenaline filled rush from start to finish. definitely one of the best movies. and my most favorite Bond movie.",positive
"Bond reinvented; superbly. Nothing close to the novel, but hey, that's Hollywood for ya.",positive
"When I first heard about this movie, I was highly skeptical. Maybe even a little outraged. ""What is this? Blonde Bond? So overly-aggressive? What happened to suave? Bond is going to be in LOVE in this???"" That was pretty much my initial reaction, and I wasn't too happy with Craig's face for Bond either. But regardless, I wanted to see it. I had to check it out, I mean, the others were always so fun right? So I saw it, and I was oh-so-pleasantly surprised. What I thought from the trailers to be mistakes in the representation of Bond's character- his brutish aggressiveness, not-so-sly behaviour, and constant serious face especially- turned out to make perfect sense for this movie. How is that possible? Because this movie is about Bond -before- Bond. Here we see him just starting out. He is very appropriately unpolished and raw. Of course, this does not excuse his looks, but with that aside, I was entirely wrong in my assumptions before going in. Casino Royale is without a doubt my favourite Bond movie, and definitely one of my favourite action flicks. Daniel Craig really went above and beyond my expectations of him as Bond, he is gritty at the right moments, smooth at the right moments, and even human at some, which is probably what makes this such a good movie. Seeing the human side of Bond isn't something we're used to, and as this is a movie telling the story of his beginning, really, it couldn't be more appropriate. His relationship with Vesper, the ""Bond girl"" of this film, played by Eva Green, is really captivating, without ever getting corny or overly romantic, and in the end is one of my favourite parts of the film. As for Vesper, I completely fell in love with her character and thought Eva Green was perfect. The action scenes are top notch, the acting is definitely there, the cinematography is great, and when it comes down to it this is just a great movie.",positive
"Synes ikke det er en rigtig James Bond film. Der er også for mange histroier, der følger hinanden i filmen.",negative

"I feel like this was a knockoff of a Bourne movie, but it wasn't pulled off nearly as well. the gun fights are decent, but the hand-to-hand stuff was fantastic. The toture, ball-whipping scene is soooooo gruesome, it is the best part of the film, but the rest is just decent. Doesn't merit a second viewing",positive
A good action flick. Daniel Craig gives a good performance and gives us something new in James Bond.,negative

"Awesome movie, but Bourne can still beat Bond. Craig is awesome.",positive
"The first Bond I've ever seen who seems like an actual person. Just my opinion, of course, but all the other Bonds seemed to me to be broad comedy at best and arrogant anachronisms at worst. I feel for this guy. I understand a little about where his attitude comes from ... why he treats women the way he does, why he's so angry. And the action is pretty spectacular. Normally, I find action films way too heavy on incomprehensible battle scenes where what happens is too fast and too loud to make any sense. This director has found the sweet spot where you can follow the cause and effect of each event in the chase scenes. There is emotional impact on the characters involved in the action, rather than a dry separation between character development and sensational explosions. Really enjoyable stuff!",negative
"While sometimes falling into the conventions of the ""gritty reboot"" established years earlier by Nolan's Batman Begins, Casino Royale is a rough around the edges romp through the world of Fleming's Bond. Strong performances and great direction recapture audience's love with MI6's top ""licensed to kill"" spy and look to revitalize the floundering film series.",negative
Bond playing Texas Holdum? Please!,negative
"Spits in the face of everything that has come to define James Bond, but in a way that makes me wonder why it hadn't been done sooner. Craig's Bond is the vicious, visceral grown-up to Pierce Brosnan's teenager, and it recasts the whole Bond universe in a sharp, seething new light. Depending on your angle, it may be the best Bond film ever.",positive
"Spettacolare. Spettacolare dal punto di vista non dell'azione ma delle emozioni. CasinÃ² Royale ha il pregio di rimettere in gioco l'intera saga di 007, rompendo tutti gli schemi e cambiando la filosofia del personaggio divenuto oramai una macchietta di se stesso. E' mirabile come il film si focalizzi sull'introspezione psicologica di Bond: il film gioca sulla dualitÃ  tra Amore-Tradimento. GiÃ  da subito si inizia a capire come Bond imposti il suo metro di giudizio, la fiducia verso gli altri, pari a zero, Ã¨ la base su cui muoversi per il proprio lavoro ed uccide crudelmente due traditori del servizio segreto pur di ottenere il doppio 00 ovvero alla qualifica di agente segreto. Non solo. Uccide e va alla caccia di una fitta rete di terroristi e di un'organizzazione segreta ben radicata ritrovandosi a giocare una partita a poker su cui peserÃ  l'esito dell'intera missione. I piani, le strategie politiche si intrecciano e si confondono, perÃ², con la figura della femme fatale, l'amore di Bond. Bond appare emotivamente vulnerabile, insensibile verso chi uccide e sensibile verso colei che ama. E proprio il rapporto tra Amore e Tradimento, tra l'orgoglio, la fiducia in sÃ¨ stesso e verso Vesper lo ingabbierÃ  segnando la propria vita per sempre. Spettacolare il montaggio, mai scontato e noioso, ben costruita la sceneggiatura: benchÃ¨ la prima parte del film sia composta piÃ¹ dall'azione, tutta la seconda parte Ã¨ incentrata sulla partita a poker e la storia d'amore tra Vesper e James Bond rivelando come la regia di Campbell sia toccante e perfetta per un film del genere. CasinÃ² Royale rappresenta quindi, a sorpresa, un capolavoro per la saga di Bond. Recitazione, specie quella di Daniel Craig/James Bond e Eva Green/Vesper Lynd, fantastica cosÃ¬ come la fotografia, la scenografia e la colonna sonora di David Arnold (oltre al tema musicale di Chris Cornell ""You Know My Name""). Un Bond innovativo che fa un tuffo nel passato, nei romanzi gretti di Ian Fleming. Voto 5/5.",positive
"I give credit to daniel craig, but we all know hes not Sean Connery. James bond in Casino Royale is simply a killing and seduction machine with no emotion. The film lacks and suspence however Eva Green was very good and you cant fault the visuals.",positive
"One of the best Bond movie I ever enjoyed. It had action, suspense, romance and Craig was awesome in the role just killing people all over the place awesome. A fun thrill ride, MP *****5/5",positive
"Action, drama, intrigue, this is by far the best James Bond film of the entire series. Finally something we can actually relate to, no hi-tech gadgets, no silly situations, real life dilemmas. This is definitely the definitive Bond film where Bond is finally a human being not only a stylised secret agent.",negative
"A great movie, but not the best bond movie.",positive
bad ass james bond! i love it!,positive
"Gripping and intense, Daniel Craig creates a Bond that defies all previous incarnations, replacing his gadgetry-old, gun-car, and slightly-comic personality with one dependent on his own personal skills and a sense of mortality that drives Casino Royale to the top, with the assistance of Judi Dench as a stern boss and Mads Mikkelsen as the sadistic villian.",positive
I really liked danial craiq as james bond it was a good story but now i want to see the origanal one to compare which one is better.,positive
kinda long but overall enthralling action movie and mikkelsen :),positive
If I were a chick I would have a Daniel Craig poster on my wall. This breathed new life into a dying franchise.,positive

"Filled with action, brimming with emotion, this James Bond movie satisfies.",positive
This movies ROCKS!!! Action was amazing and Daniel Craig is the Hottest Bond yet!!!,positive
"Better than the original, A new start to the franchise, so much intenser than previous films, It's a big boost to have more action in the film than having the main character having just speaking in his normal accent to interest audiences in a one man show. The best bond film in two decades.",positive
The best bond since connery,positive
"REBIRTH!! Bond is cool, he's hot and he's built like a brick shithouse. Much kick-ass-ness in this much needed reboot of a franchise.",negative
such a fulfilling bond film. restrained itself from being ridiculously over the top like the previous pierce brosnan films. this rivals goldfinger in my book.,positive
"After watching this movie once, I watched it again just to be sure that I was watching a James Bond movie. When exactly did James Bond turn into a cold-blooded killer ? What does Daniel Craig have to do with the James Bond character ? He is completely bloodless, emotionless, without even a trace of the charm and the sarcasm that made the James Bond franchise so successful. Why would ANY woman fall for him ?He never shows any vulnerability, nothing the viewer can sympathize with. He is actually not a likeable character, from the very first second moment on, when he brutally kills a man, one wonders why he is supposed to be the good guy. Casino Royale is one endless succession of excessive violence, shallow dialogue, and really bad acting. This movie sucks the energy right out of you. The worst of all Bond movies made so far. One can only hope that they find another Bond, soon...",negative
"Bond done right! I've never been a big 007 fan (although the Brosnan movies were pretty entertaining). Director Martin Campbell gives Bond a much needed makeover. Daniel Craig's Bond is a tough, gritty, emotional, and flawed portrayal. Also loved Mads Mikkelsen's performance. The over-the-top womanizing and cheesy, goofy dialogue is gone. The movie is beautifally filmed and the action sequences are simply amazing. The film's well written story sets up the next Bond movie (""Quantum Of Solace"") perfectly. Put aside your perspectives of Bond from the past. This movie feels more real and is definitely worth watching. It does run a little long but still a fun, fun picture.",positive

WOW! great action and thrills. The Best Bond yet!!,positive
ok i guess.....this Bond needs to lightn up tho,negative
really too violent for me ahaa,negative
I don't mind Daniel Craig as Bond but I don't particularly like this version of Casino Royale. Perhaps that's because the David Niven/Peter Sellers version is so much more fun and a product of its time than this one promised to be.,negative
"Craig Daniel has no taste in clothes, isn't suave, has no panache, has no swanky British accent, doesn't know his drinks and is definitely not a playboy .. BOOOOO!! .. who picked this guy??? Once you stop thinking its a Bond flick its awesome!",positive
"This movie is entertaining on levels I don't think it's supposed to be. I laugh hysterically during the ""torture"" scene. I know, I'm twisted.",positive
Maybe the best Bond film ever; certainly the most interesting Bond character. The only flaw is Eva Green. Is that supposed to be a British accent? We're supposed to believe that she's an elite secret agent? We're supposed to find her irresistible?,negative
"I think they are trying to get back to the original Bond movies with Daniel Craig. This means limited gadgets and more raw fight sequences. Not sure if this is a good move or not, but it was a good movie to get back to that raw style. Although I really don't think Daniel Craig can make it as the new Bond...but time will tell.",negative
the parkeur is excellent,positive
"Bond is back and better than ever! In this clever reboot Bond is taken back to his roots with style. Casino Royale is hands down the greatest James Bond film of all time. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery and with his awesome portrayal he may prove to be even better than the man who started it all. Casino Royale takes the franchise back to the beginning, showcasing a young, arrogant, more inexperienced and a much more brutal, deadly and lethal Bond played to perfection by Daniel Craig. Craig shows he has what it takes to be Bond from his cunning suaveness, his elegance, his charm but at the same time being the strongest and definitely the most no nonsense cold hearted Bond of all. This reboot shows Bond in his first mission following being promoted to 007 as he pursues a private banker to terrorists known as Le Chiffre in a sinister performance by Mads Mikkelsen. Eva Green is stunning as Vesper Lynd, the accountant aiding Bond on the mission but at the same time the woman he falls in love with. However in this film things aren't always what they seem as at the end what makes Bond even more cold and the man we all know him to be is because of betrayal, and the lesson to trust no one. Director Martin Campbell who revived the series and thrust Bond into the modern era with GoldenEye does so once again but this time with Casino Royale completely grounding the Bond world in reality. Gone are the fantasy of the gadgets and over the top schemes and villainous lairs (as cool as they are! no hate here) but here we have a much needed realistic interpretation of Ian Fleming's super spy. The film also showcases the most gripping action sequences in the Bond series from the free running chase, the airport scene and notably the ending scene in Venice. The film's most thrilling scenes are no doubt the poker, casino scenes in Montenegro. The film also showcases one of the best and definitely the deepest and darkest opening sequence to the Bond films as well as bringing forth a clever modified gun barrel sequence, a cliche that is trademarked with the franchise, with a cool title sequence and awesome song, ""You Know My Name,"" by Chris Cornell. Casino Royale also gives us the best Bond car since the DB5, the very cool, the fast and modern Aston Martin DBS V12, as well as showcasing the original Bond car the Aston Martin DB5 in the Bahamas. Craig truly inhabits the role of 007 and makes it his own in a breathtaking Oscar worthy performance. Bond has been reinvented for the new generation and I like it. James Bond will return.",positive
"They are trying to take Bond in a new 'serious' direction. I don't care for it much, but it doesn't matter, this film is still well worth watching!",positive
Daniel Craig is brilliant!,positive
A typical James Bond movie of the modern age - a bit too much hype to my taste.,negative
Impressive! Lots of action scenes. Daniel Craig perfectly embodies the new James Bond.,positive
"Daniel Craig is the perfect Bond for our time he has what it takes to be the 007 gent :a great accent. now as acting directing goes, this movie has it the action sequences were great a great story line, and in certain scenes you could feel his emotion and if you look very deep back at him could embrace it. the best James Bond film ever made so far.",positive
"Hard edged, Macho Atitude, Passonate and Alive Bond. Like it!",positive
"Totally awesome, but Quantum of Solace is even better!!",positive
My only problem is him being James Bond. He isn't as charming as Sean Connery. And his head doesn't match his body. But I do like the movie and the script. I thought they did a great job with it.,negative
"Wow. This exhilarating James Bond reboot is one of the best action films of the past few years. Plus, the acting is truly great: Daniel Craig and Eva Green give career best performances. Decidedly, it's grittier then the Connery Bond movies, but it's just as good in it's own way. Sure the plot is a little convoluted but the action scenes are well made and dialogue is as good.",positive
"There will never be a better Bond movie. Action, atmosphere, a Bond girl to fall in love with, a Bond to believe in; it is has everything you need except it needed to 1. bring back the sexy silhouettes of the title sequences, and 2. bring back Q (with a back story)!

"A surprisingly good Bond movie, but that's my impression after watching the previous twenty-or-so Bond movies in a row. It probably wouldn't look as interesting without that context.",positive
He has taken the role great.,positive
One of the better Bond films ever made.,positive
"This is THE Bond movie. It brings the Bond from the books to the scene, something that hasn't been done since the days of Sean Connery. The action is brutal and fast, the acting is top notch, and the writing is smart. This what Bond is and should be.",positive
"Daniel Craig is a great bond! A little slow, but the set up is excellent.",negative
"The best Bond in years!! Daniel Craig exceeds expectations as easily as he ties his shoes. Great performance. Hard, bloody, raw, no fake Bond surfing on fake glacier waves with fake surf boards. Pure pleasure to watch. I hope they go on like this.....Great!",positive

"Possibly the greatest Bond movie, I have ever seen. Ever. Outstanding acting, and good action throughout the entire movie. If only the sequel was just like this...",positive
Daniel Craig is not James Bond. Ever,negative
"Great reboot to the Bond franchise. Before viewing, I felt that critics labeling Daniel Craig's ""great"" performance was just a ploy to sell tickets. After seeing the film, I realized Craig brought out a harder side of Bond that many other films in the series avoided. Here was a 007 that didn't have to be sleazy to be badass.",negative
worst James bond I have ever seen,negative
A return to form for bond. Too bad quantum of solace took it back to mediocrity.,positive
Almost 100% Critics liked it,negative
Daniel Craig does an amazing job rebooting the franchise. Definatley a dark side of Bond. It's definatley one of the top ten Bind movies. Craig's performance is comparable to Timmothy Dalton's in my mind. The entire movie is great start to finish. From the action to Craig's performance. I highly reccomend this Bond!!,positive
"I do not like this man as Bond. Everyone before him did a much better job as Bond and they need to not use him again. It was a very good movie, but it got less star's because of the guy",negative
excellent if only the sequel was as good as this then the bod franchise would be back in business,positive
My dad said it followed the books well. Never read them. But I did watch a whole movie and then went into the theater to meet my parents. It was like 6 hours long and I hated the lame romance. Just really wasn't that thrilled with it. Not terrible though. Lots of action.,negative
It's Longshot approved!,positive
"First experience to an 007 movie. ""Whatever I am, I am yours.""",positive
this movie is the best of the bond movie's. daniel craig is probably one of the 2 best bonds and this movie has every thing and it suprised me how good it was.,positive
"I liked this one...even though it wasn't what I would call a ""true"" Bond movie.",negative
"Great revival, contrasting to many die-hard Bond fans, Daniel Craig is one of the better Bonds. Showing what Bond had to go through early in his double-0 status, Craig brilliantly portrayed the rough edges comparing to the witty Bonds of the later films. Just like the Star Wars prequels, Casino Royale definitely kept the Bond tradition strong.",positive
"wow I loved this bond movie, This was Daniel Craig's first bond movie, he's a good bond, I love him and I want it on DVD, it's a great film, it starred Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Giancarlo Giannini and Judi Dench",negative
the best james bond film of all time and is so good and ive seen it about 30 times and i still love watching it.,positive
"In some respects James Bond is becoming a bit dated, and yet this reboot has managed to not only capture the original style of Bond but also bring it into a modern era and up the ante on the stunts and effects.",negative
"Craig makes a great Bond and despite an overlong emphasis on a card game, this has great action and intrique.",negative
"don't like James bond, but thought this was fantastic! daniel craig is great (nearly but not quite as great as sean Connery)",positive
"Daniel Craig reinvented James Bond in this umpteenth sequel. He brought, in my opinion, a more realistic James Bond, if that's possible. It still has all the fancy gadgets and suave style, but with a little more edge. It's a great action adventure spy movie that's worth the watch.",positive
one of my favorite Daniel Craig is this best 007 yet,positive
"I've never been a huge fan of James Bond, but as long as Daniel Craig is playing him I will be watching. He is just such a cool Bond. This was a worthy debut for him. This is not only the best Bond film I have seen, but one of the better action films I have seen as well. It's great.",positive
beutifull que guapo y esos ojos!! ijoles!!,negative
"Holy Moses. A clever Bond movie where the lead girl is complicated, smart, and beautiful?Who knew a blonde Bond would work, but Daniel Craig does a great job, as does Eva Green as the lead girl. Enough action and cleverness to keep everyone happy, and a good story line. Probably the best Bond movie I've seen (none the least because they left out the ridiculous female names-Octopussy...Really?)",positive
"A newer, brawnier Bond makes his debut in Martin Campbell's hugely entertaining Casino Royale adaptation. A reboot though definitely recognizable, this Bond is the best in years",positive
"ALL RIGHT I'm going to FINALLY give this film a review it's worth. Be warned now: It maybe long and it MAY not be great for people. Okay let's get the ball rolling here it's quite obvious that after the DISASTER that was Die Another Day the bonds where in the old category of ""Too Much of a good thing"" Similar to how On her majesty's Secret Service brought bond back to it's roots after You Only Live Twice(Wich I always found odd since the series hadn't QUITE got too outlandish at the time) all the way down to The Living Daylights after A view to a Kill or For Your Eye's Only After Moonraker. Casino Royale takes bond back to it's roots...WAY!!! Back. With Casino Royale MGM decided to go back to bond's roots and re-boot it..now this is where one of my small little complaints comes from. I'm all for the bonds wanting to go back to there roots and getting away from the outlandish stunts and etc. But...this bothered me(Mind you ANY reboot really bothers me now a days,not only are they re-used but they're kinnda dumb) Why did they have to start bond from the start? couldn't they have...re-invented him with the previous arc,meaning they some what continue after DAD?,And if anyone says that it's not possible because of Craigs age don't give me that. Don't for get that when Connery retired as bond 31 and the man replaced him,Moore, was 46!! and when it's between Brosnan and Craig there's about the same age difference between them as Connery and Moore. But what ever I'm not the owner of the series and so my opinion on that is what ever. ANY WAY getting back to the film. the series was in need to go back to it's roots and that's what Casino did. The story is of Bond first getting his 00 status and of him going into a high stakes poker game to stop a terrorist from winning so they can't finance terrorist with the money. Now one little thing I should point out about this is it's nice cause they can get rid of years of continuity but..at the same time it kinda,for me, feels disappointing because let's be honest the bonds where never really ""Continuity"" wise,sure you had the Blowfeld trilogy but it wasn't like you couldn't not watch a bond and not understand the next one. But it's also interesting to point out that..this was one thing that Cubby never wanted to do(interestingly enough) and thusly always vetoed it. Now that he's dead I often wonder if them doing this is kinda like a..slap to the face to him or something but..that's me. Any way the story is pretty good and easy to follow but one thing I thought was wrong with the film is it had a very...thunder ball feel to it. Meaning it's a little slow to get going,Minus the free running scene which is a really fun scene to watch and is one of the most enjoyable scenes I've scene in a bond film since the tank chase in Goldeneye, but once it get's going it's entertaining then it SUDDENLY slows down,maybe not to the extremity of Thunderball but it is slowish,and then..kinnda get's interesting again. Now I like poker and I love playing it but..I'm gonna be honest watching people stare at each other is...well..boring. Watching those scenes reminded me IMMENSELY of Thunderball's under water fight scene. The poker scene's where interesting for me..for a while but after words it got be almost like a staring contest. Now I play poker and I understand that's really what poker is (a staring game) but it's really hard to make those kind of scene's entertaining for a movie. But that's just one of the FEW things I didn't like of the film when I talk about this film though I'll be talking more about the fight scenes. Which are some of the most entertaining scene's I've seen since Dalton's era(You'll see me refer to him alot in this review) They where AMAZING to watch. It was a down and dirty style with no holds bar. Unlike Moore or Brosnan who usually had boring fight scenes that always felt more like an ass kicking of bond then a fight scene these scene's felt more like a Dalton and Connery style. Down and Dirty Quick and Hard. Like Dalton Craig is VICIOUS with his fights and does it with no remorse the fight scene. BUT like Connery he does it in a smart and cold way BRILLIANT. Or I will talk about the great Chemistry that Craig and Eva Green had. There chemistry really was entertaining and was actually some of the best chemistry I had scene with a bond and a bond girl since..well..Dalton and d'Abo watching those two work together I felt like the creator's had pretty much..expanded on The living Daylight's already great chemistry and made it better. I LOVED THAT. And it REALLY mad me feel more...hurt when you see Craig holding Eva's character after he murdered someone and she was dead. Another thing that I liked about Craig was how he sold his clothes. Meaning..He could wear ANYTHING and make it look great on him. From a spedo all the way down to a tux. It looked great. It was just like Dalton(and Before Dalton Connery) all three of those actor's could jump from wearing something like a wet suit to a Tux (in Connery's case) or A Tux to brown Cacky's and a shirt(Dalton's Case) or A spedo to a Tux(Craigs Case) and make it look AWESOME. Meaning every time you saw them in something other then the ""Normal Bond wear"" they looked like it was something they would,or could, wear in real life and not just in the film. And not many of the bond actor's could do that(it's really been a 50/50 thing actually since the series started) I mean Moore Unless he was wearing a suit he looked just weird and as if the wardrobe said ""Wear this or else"". Lazenby was...okay in his Kilt but it still looked Goofy. And Brosnan was just like Moore. And I always think that the actor should look as if he's comfortable with what he's wearing and not like he's wearing it cause he has to. And Craig really is a guy that sells it good. You see him in his clothes and he looks good and he SELLS it good. Now I'm going to get into some bad things now,cause obviously no film is perfect, For starters one of the big things about Casino I didn't like was the Pacing it had a...semi The World Is Not Enough, but not to it's extremity, Mixed with a Thunderball feel. Meaning it was slow getting started,As I said earlier the Poker scene's got to be a little redundant and slow after awhile, but it also was like it filled up a balloon then let the air out before it was fully filled BUT unlike WINE it didn't go to it's extremity. And Unlike Thunderball it didn't stick with the one scene for too long,at least for me, with the poker scenes. I thought they where a little long and got slightly boring. As I said earlier I love poker but..watching it can really be boring because unless you know the game it can almost be like watching flies fuck for people. A check here. A raise there..it's not like things can really get exciting. But..it didn't ruin the film completely for me. Some people may find it boring some won't. I personally found it a little weird. As I said earlier too Craig reminds me ALOT of Dalton,hence why I think he's always doing a quasi rip off of him, and this is where one of my...little wrinkles comes in. Alot of reviewers have stated that Craig is the best bond the series has ever had,which is okay and mind you it's also personal opinion who is always the best,But while I was watching Craig I couldn't help but see Dalton's bond in him. They both had the same seriousness they both tried to play Bond with the same..coldness and etc. The only real difference between the two is the fact that Craig looks more like a classic Bond henchman(Blue Eye's Blonde Hair) and Dalton looks more like...well..bond(Black/Dark Hair and Dark eye's) other then that they're almost identical. Which..is FUN to watch cause it's almost as if Dalton taught Craig how to act or something but it's also...rude(?) to say that Craig is better then him if they both play Bond in the same manner. Personally speaking I always liked Dalton more but Craig isn't bad. I just think he is always a better villain then a hero. But Having said this I don't think he's the worst the serries has had,That for me personally is Lazenby, but He's not THE BEST either he's..kinnda in the middle for me. Not AMAZING but not bad and is fun to watch. I just wish that he,like Dalton, could deliver the one liners better. Maybe I'm just picking too cause I've seen Craig play more as a villain then a hero to(which I always thought he was better at) so It may take me some time to get use to him as bond. Now bond wasn't the only Character I liked or have things on. The other character I REALLY enjoyed was the Villian: Le Chiffre. Watching him and Bond in the same scene reminded me totally of Sanchez and Bond. They played off each other as Mirror Images. If Bond is the good Character Le Chiffre is the opposite of him and vice verse(like any hero and villain mind you) but this reminded me exactly of License to Kill and how Both Le Chiffre and Bond knew that they where enemies but they both acted like they where friends and etc. the same way Sanchez and Bond both acted. It was great and fun to see. Interestingly enough Sanchez and Bond's performances where both based on Le Chiffre and Bonds portrays in the books so it was nice to see the Director's and Actor's of both movies realize that and use it as part of their character's. Another Character that was nice to see was Felix Leiter,played by Jeffrey Wright, Because they gave him a more complex and entertaining role instead of like the other Felix's in the bond films this one was more involved with the story and they really helped make him more then just a 2d character. I also think that having Martin Cambell come back was nice but...in all honesty he didn't really do anything big for me. Like the film had some connection's to Goldeneye,Like come on it shouldn't surprise people there, But In all honesty I think even if a different director had done this..it wouldn't really change my view of the film. I'd still like it and all. Now this is my last set of bad things(bare with me folks I want to do this film and my review justice) Why did they ""ruin"" a classic line of ""Shaken or Stirred""? It really didn't sit well with me. Also the scene where Bond get's poisoned was,for me, more comical then scary IDK why but it felt...comical and didn't seem like it was suspenseful IDK why though for me. Now the most ""Famous"" scene was the Ball lashing scene and that scene really made me go..WTF?? like I under stand how they wanted to try and keep the film...realistic and etc. and not as goofy like the old films but in all honesty I would've rather seen them do something like in Moonraker where they had bond spin around and around in a centrafuse or License To Kill's classic throwing him into a crusher or HELL Goldfingers Castration by laser then that. At least that would've been more...thrilling then the ball lashing which felt more comical then thrilling. Also although the film has good scene's none of them really stick out. In other words there's no ""Two Missile's being fired and only having so many second's till they explode"" scene. But that's mild and really doesn't ruin the film for me..it just makes it less memorable for me. Another downer for me was,sadly Vesper Lynn. IDK why but...she really gave me this..Stacey Sutton feel. She felt more like a mush between Tracy di Vicenzo and Stacey Sutton then any thing. Like Tracy and Lazenby she had good Chemistry with Craig but..felt..like a bland character to me and felt more like a bimbo IDK why though. Mathus,Bonds Alie/Tratior, was also cool but..he needed more screen time I thought so that he and Bond could really flush out their characters. Also..if this bond is a reboot and suppose to be in a fantasy world...Why reference 9/11? Like..wouldn't it be better to NOT refer to current events so that the film isn't put in a specific time period? cause they never really did that in any of the other bonds(save maybe for the first..3) and also so it doesn't have to worry to much about ""Continuity"" for latter films? Now in closing I will say this was a good movie,I'll be honest I was skeptical at first cause of the fact it was a new actor and the whole rebooting idea but..it's not Bad. It's not AMAZING but it's not bad. Is it a little over hyped? maybe. does it deliver? Yes. Is it the best in the series? Personally speaking...no. it's good but there's better out there. Is Craig a bad Choice for bond? No He's not bad he's a little over hyped but he's not bad. Is the film worth Watchin'? Def.",positive
"Can't believe it, but my reaction after leaving the theater was ""Best Bond movie ever!"". Never thought I'd say that. It wasn't that Daniel Craig was a better Bond than Connery, but I think this Bond story told so much more than most others. It was a shame Quantum was pretty bland. I thought the franchise was onto something fresh....but this movie itself stands above Goldfinger and From Russia as my all-time favorite. The opening chase scene itself was worth the movie ticket alone.",positive
can't get enough of that new Bond!,positive
AWESOME ! BUT NO SEan CONNERY or PIErce BRosnan !,positive
"It's fitting that it took what is probably the objectively worst Bond film (""Die Another Day"", although it's not my least favorite, by a hair) to prompt the producers to deliver the best. When the series was retooled and rebooted for the 21st entry in 2006, some smart choices were made. First, a new Bond was chosen, and he was nothing like any of the previous actors in both look and style. This allowed newcomer Daniel Craig to put his own take on the character without having to emulate anyone. Secondly, ""Casino Royale"" has a much more adult feel, with gritty, realistic action unlike ever before seen in the series. Lastly, the series would be literally rebooted from the start, as this is the only film in which we begin before Bond has received 007 status. By starting things completely over, the character development could treat Bond as a real human being. When he is hurt, you feel it. When he loves, you believe it. The into is done brilliantly, with style and substance as Bond gets his first kills. It transitions in a familiar way into one of the very best Bond songs and intros, featuring Chris Cornell's ""You Know My Name"", used often in the musical score throughout in place of the traditional music (this was done for a reason, and the payoff is beautiful). The first action scene is breathtaking and really let's the audience know that this is not the same Bond they were used to. There is no cheesy CGI, no unconvincing fight scenes, but rather one of the most intense and exciting chases I've ever seen. The art of parkour is used to great effect and Daniel Craig is able to show off this new brutal side to his character. As the film goes on, the well-done plot unfolds with great pacing and some truly intense and emotional moments. Never before has Bond been so accessible, and yet so bad-ass. The dialogue is sharp, witty, and thankfully quite funny at times to offset the intensity of the plot and action. This is not a Bond who forces trite puns after a spectacular kill, all it takes is a sly smile. The film expertly weaves in some familiar characters and tropes into the proceedings, and always in a natural and clever way. Bond makes up his favorite drink and gives it a name that makes perfect sense within the context, he wins his prized Aston-Martin car after starting out with a Ford. CIA agent Felix Leiter appears with a new actor, and he steals the moments he is given. The supporting cast is phenomenal including the only returning member Judi Dench, who is allowed to portray a harder-edged M. The way ""Casino Royale"" manages to include so many elements of the Bond formula while also subverting it is simply a treat. Between the exhilirating action sequences, the intense middle act of the poker game, and the magnificent final sequence, I have really nothing bad to say about this film. The ending promised the familiar tag line of ""James Bond will return"", and for the first time in many years, no one wanted to wait.",positive
"This is the first one of 007 series I have watched and I was happy to watch it, because it is a famous series and I finally watched it! Then... it was good.",negative
"Back to the beginning, I like the more serious Bond. Love Daniel Craig !",positive
"Not a huge Bond Fan, but this one was really good... I like Daniel Craig as the new Bond after three generations of wussies!",positive
"I love Eva Green and Daniel Craig. Of also, Giancarlo. This is definite my James Bond. :)",positive
Craig's rendition of an emotionaly shocked dark bond is a much welcome step up from previous 007 films.,positive
A drastic revitalization of the franchise. Has all the sexy action of the old movies minus the cheesiness.,positive
"Casino Royale is one of the more gritty James Bond experience. Daniel craig offers a new side to the newly-instated Double-0, creating an original movie (which cannot be said for all Bond movies). The Craig-Dench relationship worked beautifully as did the Vesper relationship as it progressed. The film was made even better by the brief but memorable appearance of SÃ©bastien Foucan, the inventor of free-running (and parkour). All the classic companants of a bond film (action, cars and women), in an altogether more rounded and entertaining package.",positive
"Great movie, especially the beach scene!",positive
Best Bond film to date.,positive
"Actor Daniel Craig assumes the role formerly occupied by such screen greats as Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Timothy Dalton to set out on the character's very first 007 mission. James Bond has earned his ""00"" status by masterfully executing a pair of death-defying professional assassinations. Now assigned the task of traveling to Madagascar to spy on notorious terrorist Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) for his maiden voyage as a 007 agent, Bond boldly goes against MI6 policy to launch an independent investigation that finds him traversing the Bahamas in search of Mollaka's notoriously elusive terror cell. Subsequently led into the company of the mysterious Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian) and his exotic girlfriend, Solange (Caterina Murino), Bond soon realizes that he is closer than ever to locating well-guarded terrorist financier Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), the man who has personally bankrolled some of the most prevalent terrorist organizations on the planet. When Bond learns that Le Chiffre is planning to partake in an upcoming high-stakes poker game to be played at Montenegro's Le Casino Royale and use the winnings to establish his financial grip on the globe, M (Judi Dench) assigns beguiling agent Vesper (Eva Green) the task of watching over the fledgling agent as he plays against Le Chiffre in a covert attempt to destroy the nefarious gambler's well-established monetary stronghold in the underworld once and for all. Bond will need more than his legendary gambling skills in order to win this dangerous game, though, and after allying himself with local MI6 field agent Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and CIA operative Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), the endlessly suave super-spy puts on his poker face for a high-stakes game of cards in which the stakes are not measured in dollars, but human lives. Starring Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Giancarlo Giannini, Caterina Murino , Simon Abkarian , Isaach De BankolÃ (C) , Jesper Christensen , Ivana Milicevic and others. Directed by Martin Campbell who also directed GoldenEye, the 2 Zorro movies, Vertical Limit, Edge of Darkness and the recent Green Lantern. here comes the best Bond movie ever. i am gonna keep my review short. i have seen it before but i didn't completed it so few weeks back i saw the full movie and now i am reviewing it. Campbell directed GoldenEye before which was a nice movie but this was something i never expected from him or from anyone else. an excellent Bond Movie, a Bond movie worth giving 5 stars? that is shocking indeed. many of you have seen it but if not then it is a MUST WATCH. Daniel Craig's first movie as Bond, he did a fantastic job. i don't know about others but i find him so good as Bond and also he has great looks. he did a very good job and i loved his performance. Eva Green and Caterina Murino both looked good but isn't Eva Green like one of the best bond girls? Mads Mikkelson was a good villain. and obviously Judy Dench as M was good as always. Good Direction as well as very thrilling and edge of the seat plot. screenplay was excellently written. great Effects and action with great score and cinematography and other stuff. filled with good action fun. a pure adrenaline filled rush from start to finish. definitely one of the best movies. and my most favorite Bond movie.",positive
One of the better James Bond movies!,negative
Best Bond film ever made,positive
"Sigh... I know what most of you are thinking... ""What? How could he give this movie such a low rating? It's really good!"". Yes well, I realize that most of my dislike in this movie is just sour grapes... because it's actually not that bad of a movie in it's own right. But that is exactly my point, this movie isn't in it's own right, it's in the James Bond right; and if it's in the James Bond right, it should be more like a goddamn James Bond movie. I'm a huge James Bond fan, and I don't like it when people fuck around with my James Bond staples, like martinis, and Q. However, I will save most of my griping for my 'Quantum of Solace' review, because that movie... God... I hate it so much... you don't even know... I just, can't stand it...",negative
"Casino Royale is my favorite Bond movie for multiple reasons. What could be controversial is the elimination of the fantasy element of the previous Bond films and trying to make it as realistic as possible. When it comes to the plot, while it is still somewhat unbelievable that something like this would actually happen, it is believable that something like this could happen. As far as Daniel Craig as James Bond goes, hair color is not a good way to rank who the greatest Bond is. I'm still reserving judgment, but to his credit, he looks like someone who would kill people for a living. I think it's his piercing blue eyes. In short, Casino Royale is a clever blend of the realism and intensity of the Bourne series and the iconic title character who is charming and entertaining. If you say that this is not James Bond, I say that it is better. 8.25/10",positive
"Straight to the point: this is hands-down the best Bond movie. It dispenses with the campiness, the gadgets, and the space satellite lasers. They are replaced with realism, true intensity, and complexity. This is the first Bond movie where you genuinely are on the edge of your seat as to what is going to happen. Usually, it's ""I'll be entertained, won't have to think, and Bond's gonna win. There's a good girl that he sleeps with, and a bad one that he sleeps with first. They fight in the end."" ZZZZZZZZ..... All of these cliches are eliminated. The plot twists, turns, and you never can figure out what side people are on. I don't want to spoil anything if you haven't seen it (go see it now), but you will not be disappointed at any point in the movie. More good news! Daniel Craig is hand's down the best Bond yet. Somehow, he's tougher than Connery (which I previously thought was impossible). He's better in like every way over Brosnan, which wasn't hard in the first place. He's even better than the guy who played Bond in In Her Majesty's Secret Service. What was his name? Who knows... As stated before, Casino Royale is the best Bond ever. If you haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself to watch it. If you have, buy the special edition on blu-ray and watch it again.",positive
"liked the ""othe"" guy much more...",negative
Excellent.Yeah!!!!!!!,positive
"Great action, not so much a great bond!",negative
"Greatest James Bond movie in the whole series. It impressed me to the max and I can enjoy the gambling, deceit, and action. Daniel Craig is an ideal replacement for Pierce. Can't wait to see more of em.",positive
"All right, I admit it. When I heard the ""blonde Bond"" rumors, I was skeptical. But Pierce Brosnan was getting too old for the role, so I consented and watched Casino Royale. I'm glad I did. Daniel Craig is probably my favorite James Bond of all time (except for, perhaps Sean Connery), and he gives an exceptional performance in this one. Strangely enough, while the movie is focused on a huge card game, it isn't slow. It's extremely fast paced, and also very dramatic, as it has a GREAT plot twist at the end. Definitely one of the darker Bond movies, Casino Royale is a revitalization of the Bond films that shouldn't be overlooked by anyone.",positive
"I was skeptical, Daniel, and I'm sorry. I wasn't ready to let go of Brosnan just yet, he had such a sophisticate swagger is was almost like he really was Bond. But, back to you. Swear to God, the open chase sequence literally changed the way I think of movies, and Bond in particular. The bathroom fight, raw and real, sloppy even. Superb. I love the banter between Bond and the ensemble characters (well cast btw), I loved all the locations and sets, just a fantastic movie.",positive
"Best bits are all ""borrowed"" from The Bourne films",negative
Eh ok. I Miss Sean Conrey...,negative
"After some dull and cheesy Bond movies, this is a fresh reboot. Loved the Aston Martin, glad it's back.",positive
"Excellent installment to the Bond series...action packed,good plot, and oh!""I've got a little itch down there...could you please if you will a little to the left""",positive
"My fav bond (although truth be told I haven't seen many). We finally get to see bond get hurt, get into fights and get cuts and bruises.",positive
"Die Hard Bond fans are gonna be easily blown away by this. As ive felt differently towards the Bond franchise over the years I felt this would be quite average but i was quite wrong it was actually quite good, It was vintage Bond of course by they introduced a more serious and aggressive Bond that was new. It had some satisfying fist fights, chases and even some tension believe it or not, I wouldnt buy it on DVD because its Bond and i havent got for Bond anymore as i feel its been drowning over the past years, but again enjoyable and if your Bond mad then your gonna love this.",negative
Great return for th 007 franchise.,positive
Brought it back to the old school!,positive
"Manages to beat two full houses and a lesser straight flush, and then gets hit in the nuts over and over. Man, I hate it when that happens.",positive
My least favorite bond yet. But not the worst bond film. That is saved for the sequel.,negative
"i must say, i had my doubts about daniel craig but hes proved that hes much more than worthy! wow, best bond movie ever. plus, i think i like daniel craig the most. my favourite bond too! very good action, especially that amazing parkour (dunno how to spell it) scene at the beginning, absolutely stunning. everything else is awesome too, the focus is not the action but man, its done really well! story is very nice, very good. the gun barrel scene, and the opening song would have to be my favourite bond song too! well, if youve only seen daniel craig in the dissapointment that was quantum of solace then watch casino royale its so so so much better.",positive
Craig is the perfect Bond in our time... He is the perfect heir to the Bond universe...,positive
"That was awesome! Easily the best Bond since Sean Connery. It had an attitude about it that makes you want to sit down at the poker table with Mr. Bond. I also liked the look into Bond in his early escapades and why he is who he is. I hope they continue with Daniel Craig, he encompases what James Bond is.",positive
Don't like spy flicks! Even though Sean Connery is a wonderfurl actor!,negative

Exciting movie with action-packed thrills all round. Not always about fighting- but James Bond can't lose.,positive
"Bonne surprise que ce James Bond. Le scenario est plutot previsible mais a le merite d'exister. Le rythme est soutenu sans etre fatiguant, et, chose trop rare dans un film d'action pour ne pas etre mentionne : il y a un dialoguiste !! Daniel Craig est nickel, meme si ce James Bond-ci est plutot le successeur de l'ancien que le meme jeune. Bref, un film d'action agreable, plutot bien realise et pas idiot, je prends. PS : la scene d'introduction est dans ce noir et blanc magnifique. J'etais tres decu quand la couleur est arrivee :)",negative
one of tyhe best bond movies ever... connery watch out daniel craig is a great bond,positive
I don't like James Bond. I usually find Bond the stuff of lame male fantasy and the disposability of women in the films deplorable. This. This I liked. A good solid spy action movie with great action sequances and a good actor at the helm. It's not perfect but it's pretty good.,negative
"Cool and nice actionscenes, but just doesn't have the Bondfeeling, though it was made wit much greater technology. I don't know, Bond had his best times during the 60's and 70's.",negative
daniel craig is sexxxy,positive
not a james bond movie,negative
The best bond film ever.,positive
"I was disappointed with this. I was hoping for more action. Also I think that Le Chiffre was possibly the worst bond villan I have seen. However since I have seen Quantum of Solace I can see how this was a useful ""introduction"" to the new style of Bond film. Pity Quantum was crap really.",negative
"'Casino Royale' is the epitome of a James Bond movie, pulling out all the stops to present a new-age 007 that has everything you expect - plus a little more. And though Bond has had many faces over the years, never has anyone pulled off the character as well as Daniel Craig. From brutal and ruthless to cool and suave, Craig doesn't perform Bond - he is Bond. 'Casino Royale' takes the 007 saga in a new and darker direction, doing away with those fun little gadgets and replacing them instead with physical action that truly shows off Bond's tough skin. But some of the best scenes are not high-octane, but take place at the card table, with the film's nasty villain playing right across from Bond. Not to mention, of course, those brilliant and memorable Bond lines, the best ones interrupting the hardest scene to watch. Despite my five-star rating, there is one part of the plot that doesn't seem to work well in this latest Bond movie - the ending. Yes, you have the showdown with the villain, but afterward we see the turmoil that ends the life between Bond and Vesper, and leaves you not with the rush of an explosive action pic, but rather the sobriety of a tragic drama. Somehow, though, this ending still fails to wound this perfect 007 flick.",positive
"a top notch blockbuster, though, the Third Act does suffer a bit.",positive
Sweet new take on an old tale,negative
I love this film :) ... i haven't really seen any of the other Bond films fully i don't think so this one got me into the up coming ones... and then eventually i will watch the others :),positive
it was better then the second one,negative
Love Craig as the new Bond. Let's keep up the good work.,negative
"hella weak,the newer one is better",negative
"The very first movie where we see James Bond before his 00 status is confirmed. Die Another Day left us bored and disgusted out of our minds, and made us question whether this franchise will survive. But bringing in a brudish and rugged bond reminded us why we liked it so much. We see bond run through dry wall and sink an entire building in Venice without losing a bit of class.",positive
the bottomless chair scene in the theatre was the best every dude groaned at the same time lol,positive
Absolutely the best adaptation of a Bond book ever.,positive
"Casino Royale reboots James Bond for the better of the series. Daniel Craig was fantastic as Bond, the rest of the cast was great, very good directing, and it had impressive sequences of thrills, suspense, and action. Darker, harder-edged, brutal, brilliant.",positive
"It was ok, I'm not a huge James Bond fan, but basing it on the other films I've seen Daniel Craig did a pretty average job & he does have a rather good bod so I can't complain too much!",negative
GREAT reimagining of James Bond!,positive
Watched this when it was first released. It's quite good.,negative
"A great action movie and a terrible 007. Actually I enjoyed the Pierce's age, especially Goldeneye, but after Die Another Day and The World is not Enough the series really need a reformulation, or at least titles that make sense, but not in this direction. Cassino Royale ir more like a movie from a series starring Win Diesel or The Rock than a Roger Moore or Sean Connery one. The 007 gained a lot in action and ""realism"", but lost the main, the character. Um grande filme de ação e um horrível filme do 007. Para falar a verdade, gostei da era do Pierce Brosnan, especialmente 007 contra Goldeneye, mas depois de Outro dia para morrer e o Mundo não é o Bastante a franquia realmente precisava de uma reformulação, ou pelo menos, títulos que fizessem sentido. Mas não no setido que caminhou. Cassino Royale é mais um episódio de Triplo X ou qualquer outro filme de Win Diesel do que um que já fora protagonizado por Moore e Connery. O Agente 007 ganhou muito em ""realismo"" (aspas por que as cenas dos pulos são ridículas) mas perdeu o principal, o personagem.",negative
the best Bond movie in years.,negative
A great reboot movie for the james bond series... Daniel Craig is an excellent james bond and definitely fits the role. The story is solid and even follows the real one pretty well. Only problem i had is that they didn't really make a point to show all the crazy gadgets that he normally has like in Pierces james bond. Other than that a truly good movie.,positive
"Pioneer movie from the 007 saga when Bond becomes a 00 agent and learn about love and trust, amazing movie.",negative
This is the only James Bond film i could watch without switching it off. I thought it was amazing.,positive
The best Bond film in a long while. Flawless in its delivery and impeccable with its characters. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery.,positive
prefiero a Pierce Borsnan.,negative
I thought it rocked.,negative
"This is without a doubt, my favorite Bond film of all time!! (Even beating From Russia With Love and Goldeneye!) It's got everything a Bond film needs, and more! I don't think any other Bond film could ever compete with this. (If possible, I would have given this a 95%)",positive
the best bond movie ever,positive
I had never seen a Bond film before. Me likey.,negative
best bond since Sean Connery,positive
"I own it, this is my all time favourite 007 film! All round a great film!",positive

They freaking crashed the Aston Martin!!! .. so sad :'(,positive
"My #3 favorite bond film. Just how I like my Bond films. action,pretty girls,thrills and everything. One of the best bond films ever made.",positive
Daniel Craig's intensity and brutality fits perfectly into a believable take on Bond. And that french chick is hot,positive

My boyfriend's favorite altime movie! love you Hunter! <3,negative
"Only Bond films I've really seen are the ones with Pierce Brosnan and while all those are good in their own right this ends up being by far the best Bond movie ever. Great action sequences from start to finish. Although some parts of the story are dragged out I never grew tired of any of it. Daniel Craig is excellent as James Bond and is much better than Pierce Brosnan and even Sean Connery. His take on James Bond is a lot more interesting as well. Plus, I grew the biggest crush on Eva Green as the new Bond girl. She was gorgeous and delivered a great performance. This is by far the best Bond movie ever.",positive
"Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever, second only to sir Connery.",positive
Casino Royale was the first Bond movie I had ever seen. From the beginning to the end I was hooked. I picked the right Bond movie to watch. As long as Daniel Craig is playing 007 I'll be their!,positive
Daniel Craig was an excellent choice for rebooting Bond. The theme song by Chris Cornell is great. The Bond girl is beautiful. The plot is advanced and mysterious. The filming locations were exotic and scenic. This was by far my favorite Bond film.,positive
Daniel Craig was good!,negative
"after I saw Dr. NO, I knew that James Bond would always be forever in my mind Sean Connery. Daniel Craig's performances is with out a doubt one of his greatest performances I have seen in years.",positive
"this is a really good film, definately my favourite bond film. the storyline is excellent and love the idea that the directors were able to make the poker game so entertaining. its not predictable in my opinion it was the best film of the year.",positive
Lack luster return from James Bond.,negative
"Did not look forward to seeing this film. Craig was not my idea of a James Bond. But as i have been a fan of Bond since childhood i had to watch. What i got was an excellent film, a brilliant performance by Craig and probably one of the best Bonds there has been. A must see for any action film fan. A modern great and proof that Bond is better than all others. Bond is back and kicking arse.",positive
"A lot of people didn't like the casting of Daniel Craig as James Bond and whilst he wasn't m first choice, I knew he would do a great job and was never worried about the franchise. I think that all of the flak that Daniel Craig received when he won the part worked to his advantage because it will only have made him want to prove the doubters wrong more than ever and that's just what he does in Casino Royale. This is the best Bond film since certainly Thunderball, maybe even Goldfinger and the reason for it is the fact that all of the bells and whistles are stripped off and Bond has no gadgets, no Moneypenny and no Q to get in the way. This was a risk but it has paid of geatly, allowing Martin Campbell to craft a superb action thriller that does just about everything right. All of the actors and actresses are on top form and Daniel Craig is amazing as 007. He has obviously spent a lot of time in the gym to make himself believable as an assassin and he brings an air of inexperience to his character. Here, Bond has much to learn, even though we can see that he is definitely gifted and hopefully we will see Bond's journey continue upto the point where we have the Bond we know and love back again. It would also be nice to see the franchise stay away from the over the top gadgets too, as Martin Campbell has proved that a great action thriller doesn't need them. One of the best elements of the movie is the title song ""You Know My Name"" by Chris Cornell. It is absolutely sublime, the best Bond movie song in ages and I love that the title sequence has gone back to basics as well, one of the best introductions to a Bond film for years and years and I really mean that. If you haven't cared for Bond movies in the past, give Casino Royale a try as it's different from the formula and much fresher for it. If you are a Bond fan, you should love it anyway but either way, don't miss out on this sublime action thriller! Best film of 2006.",positive
Great opening sequence,positive
Entertaining the whole way through. Daniel Craig fits well as a Bond.,positive
"For a James Bond hater, this movie made me want to know more about this new James Bond that doesn't give a damn if his Martini is shaken or sterned",positive
Eva Green was so not believable as a Bond Girl. Just like Maggie Gyllenwhatever as Batman's girlfriend.,negative
"What away to upgrade Bond, James Bond!!!",positive
"The best thing that ever happened to James Bond. It's without a doubt the best entry in the series and took it to places I never thought it would go. It's got all the things you love: charisma, adventure, suspense, diabolical villains. However, it also is written and acted so well that you don't feel you're watching a spy genre film, there's nothing typical about it.",positive
craig is much better than pierce at being bond for sure,positive
good james bond movie,positive
Pierce Brosnan was the best James Bond along side Sean Connery. This new guy took my focus off the entire James Bond franchise.,negative
"Finally, a James Bond guys can respect.",positive
This is the beginning. It is the birth of Bond as we know him. Casino Royale is an exquisite film with beautiful scenery including the Best Bond Girl ever (in my opinion) and enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat. It was a simple time for Bond no fancy gadgets just yet which is nice because the viewer can focus on the more important things like the plot and the characters themselves. i give it two thumbs up.,positive
Nice movie loads of actions,positive
"Guess I have to take a deep breath to describe what this movie tells by the awesome prodigies a human being like 007 british agent can reach through technology. Thus catching the bad guys' a matter of ""eating a piece of cake"".",negative
Great Gritty Bond film I thought Danile Craig was a great Choice of Bond!!!,positive
NOT a true Bond movie!,negative
"An excellent installment into the Bond franchise. This film has a much more gritty feel to it than it's predecessors. Appropriate, given that it is supposed to be a prequel to the previous films. The action sequences are some of my favorite of all the Bond films and Daniel Craig REALLY looks the part of a super spy.. the most believable of them all IMHO.",positive
"it didn't flow the same as most james bond in my eyes, I won't be watching this guys as 007 again anytime soon",negative
A nice Bond movie. Lots of actions and interesting scenes.,positive
FUCKING LOVE THIS MOVIE.,positive
Was the best Bond...until Skyfall came out.,positive
The coldest blood runs through my veins You know my name! The song+ this movie made it more awesome than the sequel!,positive
This is what original bond is like (novel!),positive
"I enjoyed this Bond movie more than any since the days of Thunderball. Loved the story, the chases, Eva Green and the car. Perfect for the big screen but a great rental, too.",positive
WAY better than Quantum of Solace!,positive
"Martin Campbell's pure adrenalin, spectacular, high-octane spy thriller which goes back to the roots and shows how James Bond got his license to kill, this film introduces us to the new Bond, who is played by the astonishing Daniel Craig who gives a performance of such spellbinding scalding intensity that you'll swear he was born to play the role, he is a physical force to be reckon with those piercing blue eyes of his that burn right through the screen. He is without doubt the best Bond since the original which was unforgettably played by screen legend Sir Sean Connery. This time Bond is pitted against Le Chiffre, a evil banker to the world's terrorist organizations played memorably by Mads Mikkelsen who gives a brilliant cold-blooded performance. Le Chiffre is planning to raise money in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro at Casino Royale. ""M"" played wonderfully by Dame Judi Dench who assigns 007 to play against him, knowing that if Le Chiffre loses it will cause havoc in his organization, she also assigns the beguiling Vasper Lynd, an MI-6 accountant to finance Bond's card game and keep a watchful eye on him. Vesper is beautifully played by the sexy Eva Green, who is one of the best Bond women in long time and is also one of the most intelligent, her chemistry with Bond is both moving and genuine. Exceptional direction by Martin Campbell and utterly exceptional supporting performances by Jerry Wright, Giancarlo Giannini, Caterina Murino, Simon Abkarian and Isaach De Bankole. Terrific action sequences with seamless stunts that are truly breathtaking, with Craig doing most of them himself. Phil Meheux's cinematography is totally stunning. A lean, mean, sophisticated thrill-ride that is not to be miss! Highly Recommended.",positive
Yeah- good entry to relaunch- pity about Quantam Solace putting the franchise back to square one!,negative
"Dont like the new bond, he has the action side of bond down to a T, but he lacks any of the charm. While Pierce Brosnan did have the charm, he lacked that macho action side. To this day, only Sean Connery had both, oozing charm while still exploding on the screen with action when needed.",negative
I didn't want to see this at all. I didn't want to like Daniel Craig and I didn't want to like the revision of the Bond franchise. I was dragged against my will to see it. Thank goodness!,negative
"Sorry guys...with the exception of the parkour chase scene, really the whole movie boiled down to a long drawn out, high stakes card game. I'll watch Celebrity Texas Hold'em instead, thanks!",negative
"Very good action movie, and Craig is great, but it's not a James Bond film, no cheesy action scenes and no gadgets!",positive
"Best Bond ever and a brilliant movie in it's own right. Daniel Craig beat all the critics and provided us with the best Bond so far, grittier and much more improved without all the gadgets and somewhat crap jokes. Though some credit for the re birth must go to the stunning Bourne movies which make the previous Bonds look rather laughable.",positive
Daniel Craig *is* Bond. He does an excellent job keeping the important pieces of Bond's character together. Visually appealing. It's easy for me to forget how much I liked this.,negative

"Niaiserie affligeante. Ca part d'une bonne intention mais cela dure 3 minutes au debut du film (la sequence en noir et blanc). On finit par voir un simple film d'action debile, un Mission Impossible 4 avec un blondinet enerve dans le role principal. De toute faÃ§on venant du tacheron du Masque de Zorro et de la fabuleuse suite on ne pouvait pas s'attendre Ã  grand chose. Et puis les Feux de l'Amour sur le yacht... non mais c'est ridicule...",negative
"My 2nd favorite Bond film, and my favorite film of Daniel Craig's Bond films to date. Daniel Craig is how Ian Fleming intended Bond to be. In the 60s Cubby and Saltzman were a little worried about it being on film in that day and age, so they picked somebody that LOOKED the part of James Bond because they couldn't get Cary Grant like they wanted. Their godsend at the time would've been Daniel Craig. Daniel Craig shows the world what Bond was, is, and always should be. The relationship between Bond and Vesper Lynde (played by the amazing Eva Green, a personal favorite of mine) leaves everybody speechless. And the reality of the difficulty of Bond's 'job' is right in the face of the entire audience watching this film. Craig shows that Bond isn't a Man of Steel like Superman, but a real human being with emotions and blood and guts. Jeffrey Wright (another personal favorite) shows GREAT promise in reviving the infamous CIA operative Felix Leiter. Mads Mikkelsen makes for a terrifically creepy Le Chiffre ('The Number' in French) and has his time to shine during a torture scene between him and Bond. The future still looks very promising for the revamped Bond franchise and I can't wait to see more of Daniel Craig in the role!",positive
"I thought Brosnan was the sh!t after Goldeneye. Unfortunately, numerous bad Bond movies left a nasty taste. Then comes Daniel Craig as the most ruthless, Bourne-esque Bond ever. Great decision",positive

"James Bond is back, in a new film that acts as both a reboot and origin story, helping to repair the franchise after it has started to take a nosedive in a few recent entries. Based on Ian Fleming's first novel in the James Bond series, the film acts as an origin for Bond, starting off with him killing his first two kills, receiving his 007 status and slowly getting to the point where he becomes a fully fledged agent for MI6. After receiving his 007 status, Bond is assigned by M to take part in a highstakes poker game, in order to bankrupt terrorist financier Le Chiffre. During this time, Bond falls in love with Vesper Lynd, the treasury employee assigned to provide the money which Bond needs for the game. The film acts as a perfect reboot for the franchise, which has started to tire after several years. In the past few years, we saw films in the franchise that started to focus more on insane gadgets and over the top CGI, instead of characters and sensible plots. This film takes it back to the beginning, with no gadgets, focusing more on the characters. In a way it acts as a homage to the early years of Bond, most notably Sean Connery's tenure as the infamous agent. The cast in this film is impressive and well-thought out. Daniel Craig, who replaces Pierce Brosnan as Bond, is a perfect choice. Craig is different from the earlier Bonds, in particular his features: blue eyes and blond hair. He's rough, acting more as a thug, which perfectly suits the character. There was significant controversy when Craig was cast, but he manages to prove the haters and skeptics wrong, putting forth an original and brilliant performance. For me, Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan. Craig gives the character soul and a different attitude. While viewers used to the earlier depictions of Bond may be unused to Craig's approach, he's a new Bond for a new era. Craig manages to show the character evolving as an agent. He's terrific with the action sequences and also during the big card game, which acts as the film's big standoff with the villain. Eva Green is amazing as Vesper Lynd, bringing a sense of sensuality and strong will to the character. She and Craig work well in many scenes. Mads Mikkelsen, in the role of Le Chiffre, is both villainous and threatening, while he's also a different Bond villain. Jeffrey Wright is perfectly cast as Felix Leiter, Jesper Christensen is perfect as Mr. White and Giancarlo Giannini is terrific as Matthis. Judi Dench, reprising her role from the Brosnan films, is once again outstanding as M. Dench doesn't seem a strange fit in a new version of the franchise, while she works well with Craig in several important scenes. Phil Meheux's cinematography is outstanding, supporting many of the action scenes, and David Arnold's score is both action packed and dramatic when necessary, supporting Craig's debut as the secret agent. The title song, You Know My Name, by Chris Cornell, wonderfully supports the film, with a strong rock and roll feel, which doesn't detract from Craig's first outing. Also, the opening credit sequence, which has a strong poker feel to it, cards are added in for bullets, is well-thought out. Martin Campbell, who directed Goldeneye, which introduced Pierce Brosnan as Bond, does a good job with the actions and the story, adding drama when necessary. Campbell proves that he understands Bond, as do screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, presenting a different Bond that supports the new era. The film honors Fleming's novel. While the first hour of the film is original, which wonderfully leads up to the main card game, the rest of the film follows Fleming's novel, albeit with a few necessary changes. This approach thus changes how many of the Bond films have been seen, further supporting the new appearance of James Bond in Craig. The action scenes are also well-thought out, with the best ones being the foot chase in Madagascar, the Miami chase and the shoot out at the end of the film in Italy. The film ends on an appropriate cliffhanger and once when you hear Craig utter those famous words: The name's Bond, James Bond, you know that he has become the perfect actor to succeed as the new Bond. Well done indeed.",positive
The latest James Bond is definitely more of a loose cannon than previous portrayals. This is now one of my favourites of the franchise.,positive
"i was starting to get really disappointed with the newer bonds, but daniel craig is amazing!!",positive
The only James bond movie which i liked....!!,positive
"I have been a 007 fan since my very first 007 movie, For Your Eyes Only. It was my first experience with 007, and thankfully not my last. This by far is the best of the series. This movie made me a die-hard Daniel Craig fan too. Loved him in Tomb Raider as well. Well worth the watch!",positive
berk c pas JAMES BOND !!,negative
"A reboot and pretty much a revamp of the James Bond series of films, Casino Royale directed by Martin Campbell is a origins story of the James Bond character who has just received his 00 status and is embarking on his first mission as an 00, after Bond prevents a terrorist plot to blow up a new prototype airplane, Le Chiffre a banker for world terrorists loses a huge amount of his clients money after he had planned to make millions of the shares of the airline company at which he planned to cripple after blowing up the companys brand new prototype, after Chiffres plan has failed he needs to get back his clients money before they catch on to the fact he has lost their money, to do this he enters a high stakes poker game to win back the money, but Bond has also been sent to the game to prevent him from winning in an attempt to get Chiffre to bring him into MI6 and to reveal information on his terrorist clients in return for protection. After Pierce Brosnons exit from the character of James Bond, the series needed a new man for the job and also a revamp to breathe new life into the films and in comes Daniel Craig to fill the boots of the 00 agent. Craig certainly brings something different to the James Bond character and the films seems to have evolved and taken a lot from the Bourne films in style and presence and though its hard to fault the performance of Craig as he does perform quite well as a secret agent, he doesnt really sell to you the fact that this character is a womanizer he just doesnt have that smooth look to him or that air of confidence to make you believe that he can have any woman he wants and seeing that the makers of the film where willing to change much of the style of the film, I really think they missed the boat here and should have changed the character as well or at least brought in an actor who has that suave look and presence about him. I had put watching this film off for quite some time as Ive lost the passion for Bond movies, I thought the Pierce Brosnon films were terrible and though I used to like watching all the old Bond films as a kid, I just dont really have that same feeling about them now, so I was quite surprised that this film is nowhere near as bad as I had imagined it was going to be, the opening sequence is utter garbage, but then the real opening action scene is very fast paced and is very much in the vein of the Bourne films with that high adrenaline rush feel and very well shot, so after the initial tacky prelude the film kicks off very strongly, but unfortunately the rest of the film doesnt follow suit and there are some pacing issues with Casino Royale. A big problem with the film is that although we do have a villain in the form of LeChiffre, he really is just a banker and a middleman for other terrorists and though the films does have a real villain in the storyline, he doesnt exactly get a lot of screen time and the film really does suffer from that lack of true evil on screen presence, when we do finally meet the real bad guy that Bond is really after it is so swiftly dealt with that the scene is over before you realize it had started. Pacing is Casino Royales biggest downfall and that is because a lot of the action is sandwiched between a lot of boring dialogue that really doesnt add much to the film, except for it filling out the running time of the film and at almost 2hr30mins this isnt the shortest of rides. A huge chunk of the film is based at the poker game in Montenegro and this is rather tedious and begins to drag early on, Poker is hardly the most exciting of things for you to watch let alone when you can pretty much guess everything that is going to happen with the development of the game, together with the filler scenes that intertwine with the Poker scenes this sequence is too long and overall a hard watch as it is stretched out, which at times borders on sending you to sleep. Overall the film has some great action sequences and has evolved into something more like the Bourne Trilogy, which was a much needed change and the change of Actor to Daniel Craig, who for the most part is really good but doesnt pass as a suave womanizer, but the film is let down by with pacing issues and at times all too predictable plot twists, its by no means a bad movie nor does it really excel into anything great, its still got a lot to do to catch up with the likes of the Bourne Trilogy and even the likes of Mission Impossible, has Casino Royale brought back my interest in the James Bond series? No, not really, but I dont regret watching the film either, its more of a missed opportunity than a failure. 5/10",negative

"Casino Royale is a great reboot for Bond, spectacular in scale and gripping in drama. Although I do miss the gadgets and cool cars equipped with weaponry the action scenes and card games featured are enough to take my mind off it. The free running scene is breathtakingly shot and it goes on for a good ten minutes, Sebastian Foucan's skills are unlike any other, he's brilliant, that whole scene is guaranteed to take your breath away and keep you on edge. It is hands down the highlight of the movie. The airport chase is filled with carnage and the Aston Martin barrel roll is epic, Casino Royale packs it all from stunning action, gorgeous girls, lush locations and an extremely sinister villain. The high stakes Poker games are gripping, you feel like a viewer standing in the background watching, looking out for the players tell, and the way the story intercuts between the games and what goes on in and around the hotel is superb. With betrayal, surprising deaths and a wonderful finale Casino Royale is one of the all time great Bond movies.",positive
"Le renouveau de James Bond. On repart du dÃÂ©but et on efface tout (mÃÂªme si les prÃÂ©cÃÂ©dent James Bond ne se suivaient pas).

Et bien sur les belles voitures et les beaux hÃÂ´tels. Le choix de Daniel Craig, un acteur aux cheveux clairs et yeux bleus qui se diffÃÂ©rencie des prÃÂ©cÃÂ©dents, ne choque pas et passe trÃÂ¨s bien. Il garde la classe habituelle des James Bond. TrÃÂ¨s bon film, avec de belles scÃÂ¨nes d'actions, un duel au Poker trÃÂ¨s sympathique. Je vous le recommande.",positive

"I have to admit when I heard that they were rebooting the Bond franchise I felt bad omens about this film, it seemed like throwing the baby out with the bath water junking forty years of movie history. So when I first sat down to watch it on its original cinematic release, it was with glee at the fact I would be vindicated and that I and everyone else would hate this movie. How wrong could I have been, it was as close to perfect as a Bond movie can get, bring the character closer to his literary roots than ever before. Origin stories have a way of blowing up in the makers faces, taking away mystery from the main character, this bizarrely doesn't. It character builds Bond from his first two killings for the 00 unit and shows why later in life he is such a mistoginistic user of women as he is betrayed by seemingly everyone around him. The movie also dumps many iconic Bond symbols, gone is the pre-credit gun barrel view, gone is Q branch, gone are the gadits, this is Bond using his intelligence and brute force to overcome his enemies. The plot is also realistic for a Bond film, concerning and unnamed international cabala terrorists investing their money via a shadowy organisation in companies whose shares will benefit from the acts of terrorism the said shadowy organisation then set up. When Bond stops one of their terror acts at Miami airport the organisation loses millions given to them to be looked after by an African terrorist. Needing to recoup the money quickly LeChiffre the organisations accountant come banker organises a high stakes poker game at Casino Royale to recoup his loses and payback the terrorists whose money he has lost. The film is littered with brilliant set pieces, the free running chase and a scene were Bond is tortured and almost humiliate by LeChiffre stand out, the latter also adding to the vunerability of Daniel Craig's Bond in his first outing as the iconic hero. This is a movie which transcends being a Bond film and brought much belated critical acclaim to the franchise. Stylish and sexy like every Bond film should be, but at the same time making Bond accessible to a wider audience who might not otherwise have been interested in his well known brand of wham bam secret agenting. Quite simply a modern classic.",positive
I was so over the Bond movies until I saw Daniel Craig. He finally breathes some life into a very stale franchise.,positive
the BEST Bond ..EVER ',positive
Best Bond Film. Great action sequences and great actors. This is the way Bond films should be. I think Martin Campbell should be the only director to be involved in making Bond films.,positive
Brilliant portrayal of Bond. Puts Bond in a new direction.,positive
"'Casino Royale' is a 2006 Remade/Reboot screen adaptation of the 1967 same named James Bond Films/ book that has been a huge successful film and is number twenty-first film in the British/American James Bond series as this is the first British actor to play James Bond & is a slight reboot for the generation but is still in the original Film series. The Film is a good update on the James Bond film and was enjoyable to watch, People & Fans of James Bond say it the best Bond film every & has been rated really highly by fans, audience & critics, while I through it was an alright decent film but this is the first James Bond I've seen so I don't really have a say its a really good one but can't really say anything more really, it was well directed, well acting & well written film,'You Know My Name' is song by Chris Cornell, for the intro of the film & theme tune of the film which was well song & was an Ok song, The Romance is Utley brilliant & really sexy fun and the movie is a mind-blowing James Bond film for the times. The genre of the Movie Action, Adventure & Thriller really do well for this film, well made genre type & setting on this film, the acting was pretty good, but the Best acting was by Daniel Craig as James Bond & Judi Dench were the best acted in the film, while Jeffrey Wright, Eva Green (Who is James bond love interest which she's not that pretty or sex and not that good of an actress, but she did do well in the film), Mads Mikkelsen and with good unknown cast members, the director Martin Campbell made an unique bond film (as this is my first bond film) he did a great job, the Films style, theme & element are very out-standing stuff for a James Bond movie, the music/sound background is very one tune & song & the Theme tune in this film is average, the special effects is a Morden day turn and has been used in all the right places in the film, the Movie is full on James Bond Style with sexy looking, action-packed, full on violence, fight, bloody deaths & full on adventure & action in this reboot bond film, The Movie is a shocking & thrilling film that has great moment of time in the film and no doubt this Film is a timeless classic for are generation and towards the James Bond Film Series. The Ending of the film was sad, but in some what why stylish as James Bond is bad then ever in this Reboot for the new generation James Bond Movie & love the last quote of this (and probably in other James Bond films) ""am Bond, James Bond"" Love it.",negative
Daniel Craig as James Bond. an awesome movie! lots of usual Bond action. loved it!,positive
"great gun play and an ending with a twist... of lemon. Always shaken, never stirred...",positive
the best bond film to date and the only one without a considerable amount of cheesy nonsense. coinscidence? i think not.,positive
"Fantastic James Bond movie! Daniel Craig does an excellent job as a 007. Very awesome chase and fight scenes. Sweet cars - Astin Martin DB7's and what not. Eva Green is very hot, so she definetly fit good into this Bond film. The story was pretty cool, the playing cards at the Casino started to come off interesting but boring at the same time. Of course that didn't last long, it totally picked up and got intense quickly. The ending was good as well - Vesper's death was somewhat surprising. Overall, very cool Bond movie - definetly a good start to a new 007 franchise.",positive
Great show. Daniel Craig is a great Bond.,positive
"Wasnt sure about the ork-like looks of daniel craig donning the tuxedo of 007, but i have to say he is great, not in a sean connery type of way but in a new, refreshing take on JB. The new intelligent villain is great too, the plot winds in and out and grips you along the way. The only let down was the bond girl, i really do not see the attraction.",positive
The best James Bond movie ever. Finally one thats not so corny.,positive
"bond is back with a bang. great action movie, great Bond movie. daniel craig is brilliant. love how he is actually capable of injury. bond may get a little shaken but he is never stirred.",positive
"At last James Bond becomes REAL !! This movie is everything a James Bong movie should be thrilling, exciting, glamourous, intense, sexy and more. Daniel Craig unlike the previous Bonds actually looks like he could do all the action that is reuired from Bond. Brilliant set up for future movies - lets now see Bond be bad!!",positive
"Love the movie, Love Daniel Craig! His eyes are such a nice colour... sorry distracted. Best action scene at the very begining of this movie. It manages to catch your attention and keep it during the whole movie.",positive

"This isn't James Bond, it's just some really good action movie.",negative
"I'm a huge Bond nerd :). Daniel Craig is AMAZING--smoldering, dangerous, complex--love it!",positive
"I disagree with all the praise. The only good action scene was the Uganda chase. Bond as Craig lost his humor, the only witty part was the parking guy scene. This Bond lacked gadgets, lacked high paced action, instead focused on his genitals, unexiting texas hold'em, only 3 minutes of Aston Martin, and a very boring fall-in-love premise...",negative
"Daniel Craig is the best Bond so far, even after only seeing him in 2 bond films.",positive
This to me was the best beginning of any James Bond. Still hasn't gotten use to a blond 007.,negative
i wanted to love this one but i only liked it,negative
"This is what Bond should always have been! Thrilling and daring, it has Bond with the rough, dark edge! Daniel Craig has just become my favourite Bond and Casino Royale has become one of my favourite films!",positive
"His name is Bond, James Bond...again. This reboot was a major improvement over the last few films and arguably the best since GoldenEye. Brosnan was a great Bond, and now Craig has cemented his name as one of the Best Bonds since Connery. The story never gets slow and the action scenes were brilliantly done. Writing and Screenplay in the film were flawless and Campbell has created another great addition to the franchise. Just as you thought the series was over, Casino Royale gets it right back on track. EPIC MISSION SUCCESS",positive
"This film gets the Bond series back on track. Gold, guns, and girls are the basis of any good Bond film, and this one is exactly that. An extra bonus with Daniel Craig is more action, and a more personality savvy character. Oh yeah, most importantly, the storyline is great.",positive
"Daniel Craig is the greatest Bond in history and that's what powers this action-packed spy film. The parkour chase at the beginning is sick, this movie is sick. It has a great villain, even the poker stuff is involving. The final action scene is awesome, involving Bond shooting a guy in the eye-patch with a staple gun and the whole building sinking under water. This is by far the best and most serious Bond film. 90%",positive
Takes a very different direction from the normal James Bond film but makes it so exciting to watch. Daniel Craig impresses!,positive
"Finally, a new start (and a GREAT one at it); a far cry from the miserable Pierce Brosnan works. The second one wasn't as memorable as this one.",positive

"le meilleur de tt les j bond,,,, daniel craig est parfait!!!!! j espÃ¨re qu il sera lÃ  pour de nombreux j bond!!!!! xox love",positive
"Daniel Craig brings back the James Bond character with the most slick style possible. His witty character has kind of become dark and serious, while still staying true to the source personality. ""Casino Royale"" focusses more on story than action, while still have just the right amount to have action junkies drooling all over the screen. The cinematography is superb, better than any other James Bond picture out there, the script is much smarter, and the bond girls can finally act well. This is easily one of the best bonds out there, if not the best. This film brings back the Bond character for a new generation, and it is fantastic!",positive
"Solace was better, but this is still worth a view.",negative
"This film is everything it needs to be: It has great locations, captured beautifully by spectacular cinematography. We see wonderful stuntwork, nothing out of the realm of ""believable"" (as opposed to die another day ""glacier surfing""?). It's cut perfectly, logically so we can follow the action and story. Craig plays a much deeper bond well fleshed out, he is a hero that is battered by his work and love, but continues to do what is right in that cool bad boy anti hero sort of way. This is told by a great story written by Haggis and company, the origin story if you will, those are often such gems. Along with Heat, Dark Knight, T2 and The Departed, this is the highest form of an action film. and the best Bond film I've seen thus far.",positive
"This is like a raped James Bond: nothing of original conseption, just a clear action movie with a lot of effects. James Bond have died when Pierce drop out. I love that old action-sci-fi-crime movies which I could watch like a comedies. At least one thing left to be good - soundtrack. Anyway R.I.P. James Bond...",negative
The Bond Revamp that was a kick in the pants to its previous films (sorry Goldfinger I still love you) but a great film all together.,positive

"I'm not a fan of James Bond movies at all but this one was really enjoyable.Fast paced,twists,love,drama,good story.",positive
i thought this film was directed perfectly.not to much action and not to much talking scenes. 007 was casted perfectly.,positive
"Finally, James Bond is rehabilitated. It was about time! Cleaning up with old traditions in this case was more than worth it. Thanks to Brosnan the genre and especially the character itself became so flat that Bonds were not worth to watch anymore. Daniel Craig, who brings up new characteristics both for him as an actor and as character James Bond, plays tremendously. Caught between being a cool agent and loving man, his inner disunity persuades even the most disappointed Bond fan to revive the fallen king of spy movies. In clear-cut contrast to the other ""Bond-Girl""s (in this case not following the usual definition though she looks awesome, too), Eva Green plays magnificent and convinces throughout the whole film. However, her role might be not comparable to the ones in earlier films. Great work, though! Unfortunately, it is still a Bond. And it is about to let the genre rest for some (more) years in order to make it interesting once more. Referring to newer aspects such as the hype of poker and street climbing is not enough to make it more than just another blockbuster with a great leading actor.",negative
casino royale is probably one of the best 007 films daniel craig had done a pretty good performance as agent 007 this film had some pretty cool action scenes just a great 007 film,positive
Best Bond movie ever! Yes I said it and ment it!,positive
"Arguably the best Bond film. Not arguable that Craig's the best Bond. The only low point: the Bond women left something to be desired, but better than QoS.",positive
"Best Bond, and best Bond movie, since Connery. Quantum of Solace was meh though.",positive
"An invigorating fresh restart to the flagging Bond franchise, this is how reboots ought to be done. Gritty, realistic yet retaining some of that Bond glamour, this film gives 007 a much-needed update for the 21st Century. Eva Green also makes a fetching Bond Girl and Jeffery Wright one of my favourite Felix Leiters.",positive
"Shame because the first one was good, this one sadly is CRAP.",negative
Excellent! It got a little boring but overall a great 007 film. The action was absolutly fantastic!,positive
"It was good. Not great, but good. Had the best Bond song in recent memory as well. Eva Green was a beautiful Bond girl, no doubt about it. It was the nice start to what is hopefully a nice new beginning for the Bond films.",positive
"SPOILER ALERT! This movie is remarkably faithful to Ian Flemming's novel. Daniel Craig is spot on as James Bond, newly premoted to 007 status after killing two people. In the book as well as the movie, 007 is a cold-blooded assassin assigned to stop the funding of terrorism by beating the equally cold La Chiffe in a game of cards (in the book it's baccarat, in the movie it's Texas hold em). Bond eventually wins the game but is captured and tortured brutally. He escapes and is nursed back to health by Vespa Lynd, who he falls in love with. Later he finds she holds a secret and all doesn't end well. The difference between the novel and the movie is that the novel has almost no action, save for a car wreck and an explosion early on that doesn't appear in the film. I like this movie because I'm a purist and this is the closest to the source material I think Bond will ever get. In this way, it is like the new Batman movies, darker and truer to its roots than its predessors. It is my favorite of the Bond films and one of my favorite movies of all time.",positive
"Before Casino Royale, I had never heard of Daniel Craig, I also wasn't the biggest James Bond fan. However, after watching Casino Royale I became a huge fan of both. Now I always hoped that Clive Owen would get the role when they said they were going to make a new Bond movie, but Craig brings a sort of roughness that I don't think Owen has. James Bond has a bit of an edge to him now, an edge that I think was lacking in the past. He goes from badass to lover in seconds whereas past actors always made Bond seem suave even when he was in a fight for his life. As for the movie as a whole, it is amped up with lot's of action, smooth dialogue, and it really seems to have a sense of itself. Director Martin Campbell realizes that we are in the 21st century and that people want more then just your usual action flick. And Casino Royale succeeds in it's amazing action sequences, but the drama and romance are just as good. Even though the poker game is unbelievable everything else in this movie leaves you wanting more. Casino Royale is one of the top 5 Bonds ever made, if not the top. I look forward to what they have in store for us in the future.",positive
"The first in a new breed of dirtier, more brutal Bond movies. I like.",positive
"After seeing this, Daniel Craig is NOW my favorite James Bond.",positive
"liked it, didn't love it. the beginning chase was awesome, but the best part of a movie shouldn't have already come by 15 mins into it. torture scene was all kinds of cheesy. ending dragged on. BUT! Best Bond outing in ages, best Bond theme in AGES, so you can't ask for that much more.",positive
"Great movie! A bit confusing at the beginning, but easier to understand as it goes on. Really exciting and suspenseful!",positive

I hate the new james bond actor,negative
"Casino Royale is a near perfect..wait..forget that...Casino Royale is a damn perfect movie. At least, that's what I think. It has everything you could ask for in a action movie. Let me start off by talking about Daniel Craigs performance as James Bond. He clearly was made for those role. He's the best Bond in the whole franchise. Yes, Yes, even way better than Sean Connery. The pacing is great, it's not to long and not to short. The action is top notch and brutal. The story is superb. You can't ask for anything better. To me, it's the greatest action movie ever made. 10/10",positive
"Without a doubt one of the best Bond films to date. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery - and the story, cinematography and stunts are all fantastic.",positive
I'm no Bond fan but this is absolutely amazing.,positive
"probably the best james bond movie ever made!!! very exciting, entertaining, and great performances. Craig really portrayed, in my opinion, the real bond, better than any of the other actors.",positive
"A fine reboot to the Bond franchise, one that was sorely needed after the previous outing (sorry Brosnan, I liked Goldeneye and the World is Not Enough, but that last one you did was a real stinker). Craig's rougher-around-the-edges Bond at the start of his double-0 career is a fun and exciting ride.",positive
"Great action flick, Daniel Craig makes an awesome Bond!",positive
Oh my f*cking god!!! WHY?? for the love of all that is good and holy did they destroy the Bond dynasty with this piece of trash!,negative
"I have to admit. In the beginning I was skeptic of Craig's ability. The press set him up deficiently, using bad pictures to shed a bad light on him, I didn't think he was the man for the role that was until the teaser trailer. I then started to grasp how good he was, and man was he good!! Daniel Craig has reset the standards for Bond. Moving away from the 'pretty boy' Bond look that Pierce Brosnan brought to the series, Craig takes Bond to his roots. He shows that he isn't superman. Bond does get injured (he does make genuine mistakes) and it takes his relationships with the other characters to a whole other level and puts them in a new light. Craig is a rough Bond; he's a freshly promoted 00 agent with no experience. He's a ' half hit man half monk. This is the wakeup call the Bond series has needed for far too long. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would highly recommend it to any fan of action films and the James Bond series. Well done 007, you've finally grown up.",positive
A great start with a new Bond.,positive
J'aime l'idée d'un James Bond blond ^^,negative
Loved it!! Pity about the sequel.,positive
"Best Bond film today, finally a Bond film with a bit of emotion and a Bond that is believable as a calculative killer.",positive
najsiroviji Bond do sada...,negative
The chase sequence at the begining is breath-taking!,negative
Best Bond film in my opinion! Great action sequences and an odd cameo from Richard Branson!,positive
"I thought The Departed was the best movie I saw back in 2006. I wasn't prepared for this. Absolutely, incredibly fantastic movie. You know; Bond was not my thing until the Brosnan films; so I haven't watched any of the movies prior to 1997; hence, I can say this is the best one ever for me. However, I can see everyone pimping ""From Russia..."" so I might have to check that out. My only complaint about Casino Royale? It was a fucking Sony commercial! Anyone else spotted the Blu-Ray disc on the Ocean Club security room?",positive
"Casino Royale is one hell of a Bond picture. The characters are all fantastic, you got your impressive action scenes, hot babes with hot personalities, a very intriguing game of poker, realistic villians, lavish locations, and a James Bond character who I actual cared for. Couldn't have asked for more.",positive
"While the Pierce Brosnan years lacked in almost anything good and had too much of everything ''too much''. This one had too lite in general. Nothing really happens, but at the very beginning of the movie. It was like watching people playing a card game for hours. But thanks to Eva Green's charm and Craig's interpretation, I give it a (mere) 2, one point each, although Green deserves a 5/5 for acting and Craig a 3.5/5",negative
Oooh! So much better than Goldfinger. I love Dame Dench as M and Craig as Bond.,positive
First James Bond movie I've ever seen - and it sucked.,negative
Simply superb opeing action scene and although not a typical Bond movie was solidly entertaining...,negative
i like the street runner at the begining,negative
"To me it was Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan as to who was the best Bond. But after watching this movie, I'm afraid Pierce will have to settle for the bronze.This movie showed Bond in a way we have never seen him. He showed us that he can bleed, feel pain. But most importantly, he showed us that he has emotions. Daniel Craig portrayed Bond as less of a super hero and more of a human.The people who made this film has rekindled a fire in all of us. They have made us dream of wearing the fine tuxedos, the shaken not stirred martini, and saying that famous of lines,""Bond. James Bond.""",positive
"Best James Bond in years, Daniel Craig was incredible as Bond.",positive
"I'm not a Bond fan, but this movie got me interested in the new franchise. Too bad the follow up sucked.",negative
"It didn't feel like a Bond movie to me, but I enjoyed it.",negative
Revived the franchise after the dismal Die Another Day. I don't know if DC will ever be the best Bond but he will probably get the best films (as long as they stop involving him in the writing),positive
"Casino Royal is action-packed, intelligent, funny and the bond we want to see in some new and modern role; Daniel Craig who brings a intensity and human quality to a character that was drowning in his culture ego. This is the best bond in the recent years.",positive
"Daniel Craig is the best James Bond yet. After the debacle that was Die Another Day, this movie revives the Bond franchise and brings it to a new level. Eva Green is a great bond girl and the movie contains some great action sequences.",positive
"I have to admit, the first hour of this film turned me off. It looked like a brain dead action film, but I stuck with it and it was well worth it. By the time the 2nd hour of the film comes around, everything settles in place and a strong story emerges. So many different angles being played and so many intriguing characters. Unlike a lot of other spy films, it isn't so confusing where you just get frustrated. You'll enjoy the ride of twists and turns. Plus the fight scenes are top notch (I'm a stickler for super unrealistic fight scenes). The entire poker scene will forever have its spot in Bond franchise history for one of the most well crafted rising climaxes. Plus, Daniel Craig shows us a more human side of 007 which was long over due. Good concept, good execution! Watch it and enjoy!",positive
Daniel Craig is a god,positive
Not bad but he's no Connery !,negative
the best james bond movies so far in my opinion.,negative
Eva Green Ã¤r hela filmens behÃ¥llning.,negative
"GREAT! I never really liked any of the Bond films (oops), so this was a refreshing starter to a series remake. I don't know, the other Bonds just never really appealed to me. Daniel Craig on the other hand... yum ;)",positive
"a new actor fro 007. cool, amazing, and very handsome.",positive
the worst bond ever..,negative
The best Bond movie ever,positive
Worst Bond movie EVAR! Solange ich Quantum of Solace noch nicht gesehen hab,negative
"Casino Royale is an EXCELLENT addition to the Bond series as well as an EXCELLENT movie in general! Directed by Martin Campbell (Goldeneye) its no wonder it shines so bright as a good Bond movie, as Goldeneye is undoubtedly one of, if not thee BEST Bond movie ever created! This is definitely up there though. From the opening scenes to the very end. this movie has it all, action, suspense, love, more action! lol. The thing that really stands out about Daniel Craig as the newest Bond is the side of James Bond that he displays in this movie that we never really get to see in any other film, which is that of Bond falling in love. Usually he is just a womanizer to the fullest degree, but Bond actually catches some feelings in this one, setting it aside from any other movie. We also get too see how James achieves Double-O status. We also get to see him high stakes battle in an epic game of poker at the Casino Royale. Craig is easily one of the best Bond's ever, right next to Brosnon and Connery. His new direction for the character is very amazing and just adds that much more depth to a normally cold, callous character. Casino was a very enjoyable watch and i recommend it to anybody who enjoys a good action flick mixed with a dash of conspiracy, love, and death. A must see for any Bond fan who has not has the honor yet. 5-stars",positive
James Bond series reboot with grit!,positive
"Not for Bond traditionalists but if you liked Bourne, you'll love this.",positive
James Bond was epic but it went shit,negative
now my favourite bond.,positive
"Daniel Craig plays a good James Bond. And my gosh, have you seen his eyes?",positive
ugh Daniel craig get a life,negative
"James Blond as an antihero? Great action flick, horrible bond movie.",negative
THIS is how Bond should be. Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever. Period. And this is the best Bond movie. Period.,positive
Really enjoyed but it should of only had one ending,positive
really good bond film,positive
"Welcome Back, Mr. Bond!",positive
"a great reboot to the 007 movie line - Daniel Craig is a great Bond, and the movie has more realism/darkness than the usual storyline.",positive
"A very post 'Bourne' Bond movie. And very good for it. This is to the Bond canon of films as 2008's Star Trek is to the Star Trek canon: a complete re-imagining with freshness and impact all previous films never had. Craig could be the best Bond but you cannot compare him to previous actors as his role is a different character to the one all the others played. He is modern and hard where the others are of a past and in some cases, really a camp gun slinger. This was one of the best directed Bonds too. Shame they then replaced the man at the helm for the washed out follow up.....",negative
"If you´re single, 35 year old and like men, be careful when watching because you may want to find your Bond immediately after the movie.",positive
Martin Campbell is my favorite Bond director as of late. Craig makes a great Bond. #2 on my list.,positive
Brutal and enjoyable update of the Bond series. I enjoyed this much more than the cheesy old Bond films.,positive
"""The street art"" was awesome!",positive
"I love this movie, it has a great storyline and great songs especially the song at the start ;)",positive
"A good row-dow action thriller, but not Bond in any way. Craig's ""Bond"" is no more than a thug in a tux.",negative
"It's easy to hate new Bond movies and actors but Craig truly pulls it off! Intense action, beautiful women and fast cars. Classic Bond flick to the core.",positive
Craig is truly a great Bond.,positive
my name is bond james mighty bond,positive
"Daniel Craig, is modern James Bond! He's got the looks, the style, women want him, and men want to be him. Casino Royale was not a disappointment in the James Bond franchise. Ian fleming would be proud.",positive
"Si on ne peut déplorer les qualtiés de mise en scène du métrage. Ce reboot malmène le mythe entretenu pendant 30 ans de manière radicale. Difficile d'adhérér à ant d'hypocrise et de cynisme. Daniel Craig est un Assez 007, mais rappelle plus Bruce Willis que Sean Connery.",negative
IT'S A POKER GAME! I could watch this much action on espn. he wrecks the bond car as soon as he gets in it. and the bond gadjet is a difribulator.,negative
In a dead heat with FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE as the greatest Bond film ever made. It was a testament to how accustomed we had become to lowering the bar for 007 that its quality came as a complete shock.,positive
"Okay, I've long been avoiding it, but on a Sunday night at 11 pm after 67 reviews, what else am I to do? Casino Royale tells the origin(or as close to an origin as possible) of James Bond, British Secret Service(MI6) Agent 007. That's double-o'-seven for the newbies. His job that elevates him to the rank of double-o', and his very first mission that leads him into the ties of love, sex, & a high-stakes poker game with a ""banker"" called Le Chiffre. Now, I am a long time fan of Bond, so none of this is new to me. Sean, Roger, Pierce, Timothy, and even George; I've seen them all. When I first heard the news of a new James Bond rather than a continuance of the series(which ended in 2002 with Pierce Brosnan's performance in Die Another Day) I was very skeptical. Daniel Craig also didn't really fit my expectations of a new Bond either. But nevertheless, I saw it in theatres. It was the last theatre movie I saw with my father. It played just about the same way all the other movies played. 5 minute musical opening and all. A few distinct differences between this film and previous are: the lack of key characters Q(tech expert for MI6) and M's receptionist Moneypenny (who maintained a flirting relationship with 007 in every film). Another odd but understandable difference is Judi Dench playing M. She does a fantastic job which I enjoy, but fans like myself were expecting a male to play the role, which is canon with the originals. And the final difference is the fact that James has more of a character. He's open to love, and the pain that accompanies it. He ""has his armor off"" as they put it in the film. He's young and can't stay emotionally detached such as in former films where he bags at least 3 one-time girls. The only hint to the sequel was the introduction of Felix Liter, a CIA agent who helped James regularly in the old series. The film does stay true to the style of the old movies without over-doing all the nostalgia. Of course the original theme shows up in one form or another, with the soundtrack being led off by Chris Cournell's You Know My Name, which fits excellently. Overall, I don't like Craig, but I can't deny he does a great job. As a fan, it's no Goldfinger(my personal favorite, which makes me wonder if Pussy Galore will show up eventually), but it's a great Bond movie that modern fans have been waiting for. Casino Royale gets 8 winning hands out of 10.",positive
Best Bond movie in years,negative
i dont usually like this type of film but when i had to study it for English Coursework i really enjoyed it...,positive
"This ill-advised reboot of the James Bond franchise takes--for me--at least the long-running spy/adventure series in entirely the wrong direction. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the Brosnan-era films, which are fun, very well acted and produced, and also aren't afraid to sprinkle in some sci-fi/fantasy elements within. On the other hand, Daniel Craig's Bond is unappealing. Instead of taking out most of his opponents with cool gadgets, he mainly punches. I honestly couldn't make it to the end of this movie. It's competently produced, but the film just dragged along with no spark of enjoyment, and thus, I couldn't even force my way through it to the end.",negative
Not the classic Bond I had hoped. Altough interesting plot line and casting. Daniel Craig is actually one of the best.,negative
"I don't care what the world says, Daniel Craig was a great Bond.",negative
"I did like this movie very much. I have to be honest, i have not seen many of the Bond films. Its one of those things on my to do list. Daniel Craig i believe is a great James Bond. The right mixture of British charm and brute athleticism. Good movie.",negative
Daniel Craig proved all the skeptics wrong with his no-nonsense portrayal of James Bond. Arguably the best since the Sean Connery era.,positive
Bond finally gets out of the Brosnan gutter and into some sleek Daniel Craig goodness.,negative
"Die hard Bond fans are gonna like this quite alot, although Bond to me is starting to fall, i quite enjoyed this, Daniel Craig's first outing as 007 really gets a good response, By all means not the best of the Bond series but it has all you want in a Typical Bond movie, Craigs portrayal is more tough and quicker then any other Bond but not slick or cool.",negative
"I like the new Bond, not as much as Sean, but a close second. Good movie, seen it about 5 or 6 time already. 007 never gets old.",positive
In the way that this movie ended I can't help but have the impression that the writers spent too much time pocket-pulling over their gambling fetish to give this movie a more sensible third act and ending. (And that is an impression I certainly don't want to have.),negative
In the end it wasn't that bad at all.,negative
"Great story, the best action film in 2006, It is one of the greatest Bond films ever.",positive
Daniel Craig is an awesome James Bond,positive
One of the better reinventions of a franchise.,positive
daniel craig has replaced roger moore as my favorite bond.,positive
craig is the best bond. forester screwed up the new one,positive
"This isn't Bond. This is yet another in a long line of Bourne Identity conformists. Daniel Craig is ALL WRONG as Bond. He isn't witty, suave, or nearly enough of a womanizer.",negative
A mind blowing Bond movie that silences the critics and shows that Bond really is back! Daniel Craig is terrific! The Title Sequence is stunning and the parkour chase scene early on is one of my favourite action scenes ever! An all round awesome movie!,positive
"Goes on forever, I'd stoped caring by the final half hour.",negative
"I never thought I would be the sort of person who would happily watch a Bond film. However times and people change. I can honestly say I loved it! Ok, it's all a bit mindless but the jokes are witty, the action is spectacular and it's actually an interesting story. I really like Daniel Craig ;-P",positive
Daniel Craig showed bond is good without funky gadgets..,positive
Great Reboot of an aging franchise. Craig proves why a blond bond is better.,negative
"Bond is reinvented in this magnificent movie. Gone is the corny one-liners, Q branch and the gadgets. Daniel Craig is superb as 007. Many great action sequences.",positive
"James Bond really can adapt to nowadays film trend And the film is so marvelous!! No doubt James Bond is the best secret agent ever!! Although I haven't watched all the JB's films yet, I can feel the strong character with this Casino Royale.. ^^",positive
i liked the original with David Niven,negative
he is not sean connery.,negative
One of the best Bond films ever. Daniel Craig makes Bond menacing and vulnerable in one of the best portrayals of the character. A fantastic reboot.,positive
"I DONT THINK I HAVE EVER SEEN A SINGLE JAMES BOND MOVIE ALL THE WAY THROUGH, ONE THING THAT REALLY SURPRISES ME IS THAT JAMES BOND IS AN AMERICAN FAD, BUT YET, THERE IS NO AMERICAN EQUIVALENT TO JAMES BOND. ???? FIGURE THAT ONE OUT. ACTUALLY I THINK I HAVE SEEN THIS ONE BUT I THINK I DID MISS THE BEGINNING, IDK, OH AND SEAN CONNERY AND PEIRCE BROSNAN WERE BETTER JAMES BOND'S THEN THIS GUY WILL EVER BE, EVEN THOUGH HE HAS A NICE BODY.",negative
WHoever decided Craig could pull of Bond should be on a bread line somewhere.,negative
booooooooooooooooring,negative
Thank-you Daniel Craig for making Bond something worth watching since Sean Connery gave up the mantle.,positive
Like helloo... This is the best james bond ever.. lol..,positive
Don't like james bond movies but loved this!,positive
"More action, lots of excitement, a fantastic theme song, minimal cheesy sexual innuendo (seriously, it gets old) - all leading to one of the best movies I've seen in years. Casino Royale shows a darker and more serious Bond, something that I hope continues for years to come.",positive
"When Daniel Craig was cast as Bond, unlike many I did not hold my hands up in despair, and predict a flop. I was willing to give him a chance, and certainly felt he could give something different to the role. Sadly, this film left me with an extreme sense of frustration. Perhaps due to my high hopes for the film, and the many positive reviews? And yet, it seems beyond my personal expectations. The film tried too hard to be different, the end result being an entirely different Bond film, but a very unoriginal Hollywoodised action flick. Yes Craig gave a tougher, more brutal edge to Bond, but what Hollywood action hero isn't tough and brutal? In fact, it was the desire for Hollywood action that ruined this film for me. For example, the scene containing free running (parkour) near the beginning epitomises the desire for great action, and little sense. If you recall, there is a moment where Bond decides to climb into some sort of demolition vehicle. Yes, it looked great as the vehicle came crashing through a concrete wall, but if we actually think about it, there was no need whatsoever? It did not achieve anything, not just in terms of film artistry, but also plot - it didn't help him catch the bad guy! The free running itself was another attempt by the director to wow the audience into submission, there was quite literally no point to it whatsoever. Why on earth did the villain decide to go up a crane? - ""I know, I can escape him by climbing to the top of a crane"" - No my friend you would have been better off finding yourself a car. I am not surprised this film has been received well and that it is a hit at the box office - but I'm sorry Mr.Campbell, I see through you. I will openly admit I found the poker scenes enjoyable, and I found Mads Mikklesen's performance particularly enjoyable. Not a bad effort, and it does indeed breathe new life into the Bond genre, but I could quite easily go down to Blockbuster, search the action section for 5 minutes and find something just as good! Ultimately, what I found offensive about this film, was that all involved seemed to believe that if they throw a load of heavy duty action scenes at the audience to satisfy us - not this film goer I'm afraid..",negative
"Daniel Craig nailed it just right. I mean, I had some doubts at first, but he makes an excellent Bond. More daring than its predecessor and a lot more full frontal action! The poker also rocked, who would have thought he'd win with a 2, 3 clubs? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 90% - Daringly original in its genre. Or highly entertaining with uber story-line. touching! awesome! repeatable! * Hang on to your seats - It's one hell of a ride",positive
"Daniel Craig and excellent pacing revitalize the ""Bond"" franchise.",positive
"an excellent movie, Daniel Craig made a hell of a James Bond",positive
better than the others that i have seen,negative
Daniel Craig IS James Bond. This film opens with the greatest chase from any 007 movie and immediately grabbed my attention and made it my favorite Bond film of all time.,positive
"My 3rd favorite Bond movie ever, next to Goldfinger & Thunderball.",positive
pretty good bond flick for just sitting at a poker table for 3/4 of the film,negative
"One of my all time favorite movies. Danel Craig plays the perfect role, the plot was interesting and engaging. Not being a bond fan myself, i loved the movie. The action scenes were spectacular. This movie takes you along through an adventure you will never forget-honestly a well done film.",positive
"Jam packed with non-stop action and THE greatest chase scene of all time. It is, without a doubt, the best Bond movie there will ever be.",positive
The BEST James Bond flick of all time and 'yes' Daniel Craig is the best Bond period.,positive
"Casino Royale is a remarkable film. Daniel Craig is exactly what I feel James Bond should be. It's funny that not many people had faith in him, until they saw the movie for themselves. I really wanted to see an actor put a new twist on the character, rather than copying the tried and true smooth-talking 'Bond, James Bond' from the older movies. I have to say, Daniel Craig did not disappoint me. The main thing that I had problem with in older 007's is gone. Those over-the-top gadgets were the only thing that prevented me from loving earlier Bond films. For instance, the car that could become invisible and the surf boards with weapon compartments in Die Another Day, and the wheelchair with a missle as a leg cast in GoldenEye, just to name a couple. I'm not very familiar with the oldest Bond movies, but I'm pretty sure they had even whackier gadgets than that. Anyway, the closer to realism, the better, in my opinion. I thoroughly enjoyed the action sequences in Casino Royale, as well. They were very extreme, yet remained so believable. One of my favorite movie scenes of all time is the scene when Bond chases the bomb maker in Madagascar. I literally cannot think of the best words to describe that scene, so all I will say is, GOD DAMN! Ironically, action is not this film's only strong point. I also love the tension, especially in the poker scenes. To this day, those moments make my heart rate increase slightly. No spoiler intended, but in one scene Bond's heart rate gets a bit of a boost as well. I love the way this movie came from basically nowhere, to pretty much blowing the minds of fans around the world, reminds me of what Batman Begins did for that franchise. All I can say is, thank God for the Jason Bourne trilogy. If Bourne had never came along and set a new bar for Secret Agent action thrillers, I seriously doubt that 007 would have been rebooted with such a vengence. Casino Royale is a perfect masterpiece.",positive
loved it... as all the 007 movies,positive
"I hated all of the originals, and I hated this just as much, but was kind of forced to watch it with a friend.",negative
OMG! Daniel Craig made me eat my words...I Thought that he would make a Terrible james Bond! But I was so much wrong! Now for me he is my second favorite bond! Sean connery is the first.,positive
one of da best movies eva created,positive
The best Bond movie ever,positive
"Som i alle James Bond er filmen handlingsmÃ¦ttet, men Daniel Craig er alligevel en af de bedste Bond, hvis ikke DEN bedste, da han virker mere trovÃ¦rdig og hÃ¥rdfÃ¸r end sine forgÃ¦ngere. Det er sjovt at sammenligne filmen med bogen, for begge to fremhÃ¦ver den luksuriÃ¸se og farlige livsstil som Bond har. I denne er der dog fÃ¦rre gadgets og til gengÃ¦ld en mere trovÃ¦rdig skurk, ikke en superskurk som vi kender det fra nogle af de gamle film, og dette er igen bedre i trÃ¥d med bÃ¸gerne. LÃ¦s bogen og se filmen!",negative
He makes a believable Bond,negative
"great action, i luv Daniel Craig much better",positive
The best Bond film since Goldfinger. And Daniel Craig's stunt double is a New Zealander! :D,positive
Daniel Craig is not James Bond!,negative
My favourite Bond film of the lot.,positive
bond wat more do I need to say,negative
samen met goldfinger mijn favoriete bond en eva green is mijn favoriete bond girl ooit!,positive
best bond movie by Daniel Craig,negative
i find this film very enjoyable to watch. there is nothing bad about this film at all! the story is very nice. the ending might be sad but bond learns a very good lesson after all. this film was way better than the crappy octopussy. bond is very clever in this film and i mean clever. daniel craig is an awesome actor. and the stunt scenes are awesome and enjoyable to watch. its just a normal classic 2006 film. and yet it became one of my favorite films of all time.,positive
"Slightly lacking in the confidence department, and the hairy chest department too, nevertheless this unfeasibly fit Bond does Her Majesty a fine service with super performances, plot, gritty realism and some great borrowings from the obscure French sport of Le Parkour. Also recommended: Banlieue B13 (for the original Parkour), and for Bond: The World Is Not Enough, Goldeneye, Never Say Never Again, Dr No, A View To A Kill.",positive
"Casino Royal is a classic bond movie. I would say it was the best but I like a bond flick to come with Q, M and money penny, aswell as some witty jokes. However this is Craigs take on Bond, a ruthless, agressive yet sensitive 007. This film is just fantastic.",positive
"A great restart of the Bond franchise. I like Daniel Craig a lot as Bond, and I enjoy how it's more rooted in reality than previous 007 entries. Hell, this makes previous Bonds look like films for children.",positive
"The James Bond franchise really needed a reboot, and that was what we got. Gone are the unrealistic gadgets and tiring oneliners. While Brosnan's Bond was a walking anachronism, a 60's character stuck in the 90's, this Bond re-imagined him as how he would have been conceived today. Daniel Craig is brutal and the way you'd expect an agent with licence to kill would be. The best James Bond movie, well since ever.",positive
"very good movie, great Bond this time and the story line wasn't as cheesy as the rest",positive
"Pas mal le nouveau James Bond, mais Ã§a manque de gadgets et de James Bond Girls!",positive
"I like this kind of James Bond, plus Eva Green!!",positive
My favourite Bond... after Live and Let Die.,positive
the original bond is still the best.,negative
"It immediately got my interest. Craig pulls off the classic suave and witty Bond that we've known from past movies, but with a less goofy and perhaps more cynical tone. For starters, the action always kept me entertained. Each scene was suspenseful, and thrown into the story just where it needed to go to ensure that I didn't lose interest. Though watching people play cards isn't exactly action packed, this movie did manage to make it a bit intense. The plot was sometimes a bit hard for me to follow every aspect, but I could figure the basic gist of it. This movie should entertain new-comers to the Bond series as well as satisfy old fans.",positive
Interesting and sexy.,negative
As good as Bond movies can get,negative
James Bond terbaik!!!!,positive
"Finally, we're back to the good stuff. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery, and it really shows here. More time is taken to the story and villian, and I'm glad they did that. Bond, James Bond.",positive
Felt like bond throughout.,positive
"good, but prefer the previous 007 style",negative
"Because it is not like the other previous James Bond movie, it is relevant as a Bond movie... Cool one.",negative
"Not only the best Bond movie ever, it is one of the best action movies ever. Daniel Craig was born to play this role. Plain and simple, the most badass Bond character we've ever seen. He brings so much more energy, realism and character to the role than the overrated Brosnan. Martin Campbell did a fine job directing Golden Eye, but does an absolute phenomenal job with Casino Royale. Just can't say enough amazing things about this movie.",positive
The best bond since the 60's.,positive
"Best Bond movie by far, not to mention my favorite bond.",positive
"Much better bond than Brosman. I have never really watched alot of the older bond movies. Goldeneye was good for me, but Craig and this new style makes Bond movies something I am excited to watch - which was not the case before.",positive
"One of the best bond films in the series. This has some of the most intense action sequences ever put in a bond film, let alone any film. A lot of people talk crap about Daniel Craig as a bond, saying he's too tough and he's not witty enough. But I say he's perfect because he's supposed to be the young bond, he's edgy, he's gotta find his niche. Great film.",positive
"This one feels like a true Bond movie, the best since Goldeneye.",positive
"The opening chase scene was brilliant. The movie as a whole is alright. The bond series has completely deviated from the Moore & Connery days, which is disappointing. Better than Quantum of Solace, by far, but sadly only a prequel instead of an independently-standing film.",positive
Liked it Daniel Craig is about as close a likeness to Sean Connery I've seen I just hate the did a reboot instead of continuing the story just in his own way to me it hurts the continuing story line.,negative
"I admit that I had only fully seen 1 Bond film prior to seeing this one and that was Goldeneye. But I must say that I was impressed with Daniel Craig's first film. I would have liked to have seen Clive Owen get the part, but Craig more than holds his own as a throwback tough guy/action hero. I do think it feels more like a poker movie than anything for a large part, but it has plenty enough action scenes to keep one thrilled and Bond leaves all the goofy gadgets at home and delivers a good old fashioned action film.",positive
The action sequences were great and cinematography was beyond previous 007 films.,positive
a very HOT James Bond...,positive
"There are 2 ways to play bond. Serious, or comical. Daniel craig skips both those and plays it totally badass! It starts with Bond gaining his ""00"" status. He goes to the bahamas, follows someone to Miami, stops a plane bombing, goes to a casino, wins 40 million, discovers his lover betrayed him, discovers she didn't really, kills her blackmailer. Plus a lot more. I mean, this is one of the best.",positive
kul att se bond mer som han är i böckerna,positive
Casino Royale dispenses with the more fantastic elements of Bond and reboots the franchise with a far more raw and brutal version than even displayed in the Dalton series.,positive
"Not only is it the best Bond movie ever made, it is also one of the best action movies ever made. Daniel Craig surprized everyone with his brilliant, shocking performance as James Bond. Without a doubt the most realistic and badass Bond. Sean Connery should be worried.",positive
one question tho how come that the paddles have removable cables?,positive
The best bond I even seen.,positive
"Martin Campbell was hired no doubt for bringing Brosnan into the Bond family with ""Goldeneye"" , which I hated. On this, a reinvention of not only Bond but the genre, Campbell constructs a well paced, intelligent and slick thriller, replete with characters you care about and a brute lead in Craig, whose aggressive take on Bond is not only refreshing but altogether necessary",positive
"James Bond is back--darker, slicker and more human than ever before. It is the masterful combination of these traits that Casino Royale does best, driving the characters to revolve around the story and vice versa--servicing one another rather than coming at odds. The casino scenes may have been a bit dragged on, but that's just opinion. Casino Royale is to James Bond what The Dark Knight is to Batman. For anyone interested in creating a masterpiece reboot of the Bond franchise, simply contact Martin Campbell.",positive
Great Great Bond flick,negative
"the later part of this decade has seen several 'reboots' to long time film franchises (batman, superman, star trek), and this movie does it oh-so-well. definitely the most sophisticated plot that has ever been in a bond film.",positive
One of the best opening scenes of all Bonds.,positive
"Getting a fresh start as the Bond franchise is rebooted with Ian Fleming's first 007 novel, Daniel Craig is quite effective as the not-very-polished MI6 agent fresh off receiving his Double-0 status and Eva Green is captivating as a foreign liaison agent in this grittier movie that tries to be more Bourne and less Moonraker, not counting the absurd Texas hold 'em game where all the players always have the greatest hand in the world at the same time.",positive
"It was pretty good. I didn't like the story too much because James Bond was too lovey dovey in it. I know that is what the story was suppose to be about. But there wasn't as much action as you would want from a bond film. Daniel Craig was an except bond thought. He sure does know how to play the part. I really liked the opening, because it also showed the artistic part of bond films also.",negative
Good concept. Although shorty isnt the best jamesbond. Also a bit too much bullshit.,negative
by far the best bond in by far the best bond film ever.,positive
Prefer the older James Bond movies.,negative
"unlike other bond movies, this one is actually about human feelings.. bond is vulnerable and deeply touched by a women 4 real!! and i think that daniel craig doesn't have any of the typical bond sarcasm or lack of depth, it's an awesome movie!",positive
"Any Thug can kill Is Craig for everyone? James Bond (Denial Craig) in his first mission as a double 0 is put on the trail of a banker for terrorist, the infamous Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen). Eventually chasing him down to Montenegro where Le Chiffre is holding a high stakes game of Poker at the Casino Royal, with the buy in big and the repercussions even greater, will James keep his cool? But who can be trusted when even Jamess own motives are brought into question by M (Judi Dench)? Denial Craig is the new James Bond, does he live up the mantel? The legend? Does he make women go weak at the knees? And men burn with envy? Well the short answer is yes he does, and probably better then any bond before him. Now, to say that Craig is the greatest James Bond ever will spark an argument Im sure, it is quite the claim after all. But thats what I am saying. Craig feels a lot more like the James Bond that Ian Fleming wrote about in his books then any of his previous comparisons. Craig doesnt just look the part, he feels the part too. Craig is more British then maybe all the other Bonds combined, he is both classic, classy, fluid and refined as well as being raw and gritty. With this new Bond there will be blood, not just other peoples either. This time James gets as good as he gives in Casino Royal, especially when being tortured. Do not be mistaken this is by no means the same James Bond as the other 20 movies with the same main character. Apart from the name, M and that he is a British spy, this could be a completely different franchise. In Casino Royal, Martin Campbell (the director) trades off the gimmicks for brute force and pure action. There are no unbelievable gadgets or cars to be found here, and not a Q in sight. Just Bond, his associates, his mission and his morals. This is Bond boiled down to the bones and rebuilt and it works. While Craig is amazing, it must be said that the supporting cast meet him in acting ability. Judi Dench is the only actress reprising her role and in truth she belongs in Bond now. Eva Green is sexy, slick and compassionate as Vesper Lynd (who becomes the love interest). And Mads Mikkelsen almost steals the film as the evil and brilliant Le Chiffre, he is truly evil. In Casino Royal you really do get the feeling that Bond cares about what happens around him, he is driven by his duty but he is aware there are always repercussions, even more so while being tortured. This is a version of Bond with a heart, a real heart, where he ways up the pros and cons of trading off his job for the girl. The story (unlike most Bonds) is gripping in Casino Royal, it is far more involved then any of the Bands before it. If you dont care for that then the action more then makes up for it. Starting from the very first sequence, that chase is amazing and worth seeing the whole film alone. Martin Campbell takes everything we knew about Bond, shakes it, stirrers it, and serves it up with a slice of lemon and it is both refreshing and cool. Denial Craig finally secures his place as a house hold name.",positive
dis movie sucks!!!!!!!!,negative
"one of my least favorite Bond movies. except for the opening chase and final scenes, not much action at all. I was so bored watching them play cards for two hours",negative
"Craig's Bond is great, but I found Bond falling for that woman totally unconvincing.",negative
Nouveau style pour une nouvelle sÃ©rie de Bond avec Craig... Et sa fonctionne trÃ¨s bien !,positive
New kind of bond movie,positive
Probably the best Bond fim made to date. Excellent.,positive
The best Bond movie yet in my opinion.,positive
Another movie I could watch over and over. Even though it's 9 days long,positive
one of the very best Bond's,positive
"The best Bond movie in a looooong time. And yeas, Daniel Craig is as good a Bond as Connery was. There. I said it.",positive
The guy is going a pretty good job filling in the shoes of Conery I enjoyed this bond movie.,positive
"After Roger Moore retired from being James Bond, I lost intrest, so I skipped the Pierce Bronson era completely but after seein 2 Daniel Craig snorefests I've sinc gone back and watch PBs as 007 and he was way better I have to say.",negative
Bond is super cool. This may change up from the older bond movies but that is just fine. There is enough pull over from the previous movies to maintain the bond tradition.,positive
Did not like this movie that much... It didn't feel like James Bond to me.,negative
dont like any bond movie. never!,negative
More to see like this....,positive
Not a big Bond guy but this one was a good retelling.,positive
"Craig makes a very good Bond. If you kike the franchise, you are likely to appreciate this one.",negative
"The best bond ever made since Goldfinger. Martin Campbell does away with all the cheesy gadgets of the previous movies, and turns James Bond from a lady obsessed lame character into a someone you can throughly enjoy.",positive
"A darker, more serious Bond movie than we've seen... ever. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery and is absolutely fantastic. Craig reinvents the character and makes it his own, so much so that I'm hoping for Bond 23 (Bond in New York? No.) That said, Casino Royale does run a bit long (one of my biggest pet peeves in movies) and doesn't have as much action as the sequel does. That said, it's still an incredible James Bond movie and an easy recommendation for pretty much anybody who hasn't seen it yet.",positive
"Amazing action? You Bet! Great Acting? Daniel Craig and Eva Green - of course! Good story? No, not really. And a very weak ending on top of all.",negative
This is not the James Bond that I remember,negative
"This is by far my favorite James Bond movie. Remakes usually have difficulty living up to the originals; however, this movie feels more like a polished version of the original. Daniel Craig does a fantastic job portraying a newly promoted 00. The film direction has a constant forward motion to it, the music adds a certain raw feeling to the movie, and the timing feels flawless. I was also impressed that this Bond doesnt mind getting dirty. In the past, Bond has been played as a man, in a tux, who can take out an entire mafia warehouse worth of people without even messing up his hair. But this script feels more realistic in the sense that Bond has his moments of getting bloody and bruised, which makes him even more B.A. since we know he can take a punch.",positive
"The best 007 movie in years....Daniel Craig is the kind of James Bond you can root for. He has a hard as nails approach to the character where when he punches you can almost feel the pain!! Eva Green is up there with Diana Rigg as a Bond Girl who matches 007 in every way. The Action is great, the story is well played out. Casino Royale is Top Notch Entertainment.",positive
"was good, next 1 was better.",positive
A refreshing revamp of this often tired franchise. Possibly the best Bond in decades...,positive

"The remake of the classic Ian Fleming novel of the same name marks the long awaited reboot of the James Bond franchise. And what an amazing beginning it is. 'Casino Royale' suceeds on every level concievable, blending stunning action with a romatic aspect to create an incredibly compelling tale. The reboot suceeds for the simple reason that it does something that nobody thought was possible anymore - it turns Bond back into a human being. A dark, suave, conflicted human being. Every second of the story is charecter-driven, as as such the film reveals much about the conflicted inner nature of what turns out to be a truly fragile hero, which makes for a truly edge-of-your-seat compelling viewing experience. With the flawless performances of Eva Green and Daniel Craig at the helm, this reboot is nothing short of masterful.",positive
Daniel Craig's version of Bond was gritty and cool,negative
My favorite Bond so far. Don't even remember how often I watched it!,positive
A grittier Bond that lacks the cheeky British charm previous Bond's have,positive
"Let's get one thing clear. The typical older Bond fan will NOT like this movie. Regardless of whether or not you think Daniel Craig is a good Bond, Casino Royale is thematically different from previous Bond titles, which may upset aficionados. Ultimately, Casino Royale is so incredibly successful because of its pedigree (or rather its insightful betrayal of that pedigree) and brutally intense action sequences. Recently, Bond films like Die Another Day, Goldeneye, and The World is Not Enough have set a standard (albeit a low one) for ""what is Bond"". Does it have a handsome male lead? Does it have a passively aggressive buxom female lead? Does it have guns? Does it have gadgets? Does it have ridiculous chase scenes? Almost all of these characteristics of a Bond film are side-stepped here. In fact, the opening chase scene is all on foot. There are no gadgets or vehicles. Just Bond running through crowds, buildings, and construction sites. This intensely HUMAN quality is prevalent in the film's themes, which makes the Bond cannon all the more enjoyable. Martin Campbell didn't NEED to explain why Bond is such a womanizer. But doing so makes for a far more human, and therefore credible, story. Bond himself (though missing a well-defined arc) is played out with verisimilitude. He's detached, but not completely cold. He's precise, but not menial. He's capable, but flawed. He's exacting, but not brutal. If there's any misfortune in Casino Royale's characters, it's the lack of depth to Le Chifre, the villain. Humanizing the villain, however, would have brought up tangential moral issues that would have drawn the attention away from Bond and Vesper. In a nutshell, Casino Royale is essentially what would have come out of a realistic rendition of Bond's persona. It's as if someone looked at the world of international spies, and took it SERIOUSLY.",positive
je l'ai jamais fini!!haha,negative
"Instantly Bonds best yet i cant think of one bit i didnt enjoy in this film and i loved the new Bond and i think Craig was perfect for the role Everything from the opening credits to the amazing climatic ending was picture perfect and i cant wait to watch it in HD Weather your a Bond fan or not. Grab a drink (Shake it, Dont stir it.) Some popcorn and watch this amazing film that most defiantly belongs in my top 10 favorite films!",positive
the first james bond i liked,positive
"Daniel Craig definitely elevates the Bond character to me! Not as posh, but grittier and tougher, more believable for me. I like his tough demeanor, he is more believable as a 007 with a license to kill, and equally capable! Alot of action. I buy into the new Bond.",positive
"Not only is Casino Royale extreamely good for an action movie/thriller, its also extreamely good for a movie in general. Granted, it takes itself a bit seriously, but it has a plot, plausible enough character, decent acting and scirpt. Probably what I liked the most was the visual look of the film. Everything is extreamely sleek and stylish. I really would like to say more, but that was the main thing that stuck out for me. Still, its visual and engaging movie that I will probably watch again sometime.",positive
Dissapointing. Not very royale at all.,negative
yeah good movie never gets old,negative
I think I liked this OK. Pretty good for a new Bond movie.,negative
good bond flick. not sure where they dug up this guy to play bond but he is solid for the role.,positive
this is not what a james bond movie is supposed to be. this movie dragged on for-EVER.,negative
"Craig is the best Bond, and this is also the best Bond movie, LOVED it. It was such a good movie, and all the other Bond films should have been the same.",positive
"A bit too long, but there were some great Bond moments in this movie. Although not a lot of action, it does display a very nice action scene towards the end in Venice and an exciting chase early in the film. Personally, I prefer the old Connery movies with gadgets and everything, but this was a good movie still. Probably the third best Bond movie I've seen, behind only Goldfinger and From Russia With Love.",negative
5 stars because Daniel Craig is HOT! The movie is good too!,positive
"Though too long for my taste, ""Casino royale"" is definetly one of the best films of Bond series. Featuring Daniel Craig as a truly superb 007, an engrossing story along with the exciting action scenes that are directed solidly, this movie is a must-see for James Bond's fans.",positive
"One of the best 007's in a long time, Daniel Craig does a great job as the new Bond.",positive
boring(2006) Okay...so I Re-watched this in 2012 and it's not as boring as I thought it was in 2006. So the rating has gone up from half a star to 3 stars,negative
"Great film, but Bond is NOT blonde.",positive
oooh - daniel craig xxx,positive
"From an action movie standpoint this film was excellent, but as a James Bond movie, not so much.",positive
"I don't like james bond much, but this movie totally went on a different direction and just kicked a whole lot of ass.",positive
finally a new Bond movie worth watching.,positive
Un changement radical dans la serie des james bond. Beaucoup plus de brutalité et de réalisme qui injectent un nouvel esprit dans cette serie incontournable...,positive
The Opponent is creepy hot.,positive
Best Bond movie ever. Closely followed by Goldeneye.,positive
"This is, for the most part, what a good action movie should be. Rather than feeling the need to bombard us with explosions every ten minutes, it isn't afraid to slow things down to let the story and character relationships progress. But the action scenes that are here are thrilling and innovative, and the plot continues to keep us in suspense by not always going in the directions you'd think, as if the poker scenes aren't nerve-racking enough. Though I confess I have little to compare him to, I think Daniel Craig embodies an excellent James Bond: smooth, sexy, and classic tough-guy on the surface, but far from perfect or invulnerable. There's nothing here to really elevate this above other solid action films, but it's very entertaining if you take it for what it's supposed to be.",positive
old school 007's are better,negative
One of the best James Bond movies. Craig is brilliant and realistic as Bond.,positive
Love love LOVE the new Bond.,positive
Not my favorite Bond movie.,negative
"Martin Campbell reworks the Bond formula to a more character driven film, while still retaining the twists and turns of previous entries , and well done action sequences, with these scenes being some of the best in the 007 legacy. As for the character driven story, it works pretty damn fine, with Haggiss screenplay adding the much-needed emotional aspect to the film. Craig is not the best Bond, we all know who that is, but he is by far not the worst, actually he is probably the best behind Sean Connery. His 007 though, effectively conveys an emotionally embodied Bond that is missing from most of the previous installments. All in all though, Campbell and company do a wonderful job at breathing life into a series that was starting to lose its crown at being the apex of spy films.",positive
"A harder, tougher and much more exciting action from this new Bond.",positive
"when i saw bond films before Casino Royale(2006), i just thingking about girls, gadget, and tuxedo. but when i see Daniel Craig for the first time as James Bond : WOW! (sebelum Daniel Craig, kalau saya nonton Bond, saya bakal cuman liat cewe2 seksi, senjata rahasia super, dan tuxedo. pas liat Daniel, WOW)",positive
My favorite Bond movie!,positive
"This Bond reboot brought much needed life to the series. I thought it was over two or three times, but they kept the plot twists coming.",positive
not as good as the original Bond,negative
gotta love Bond! could have lost the whole section from leaving the casino to the final fight in venice but still a great turn for daniel craig.,negative
"""Casino Royale"" shines first in a very tight and brilliantly adult screenplay. This is by far the most interesting and complex of thrillers in a very long time. All the rather tired old comic strip aspects of previous Bond films have been swept away from outlandish plots to the old fashioned double entendre that used to pop on the screen like cartoon bubbles. This Bond is witty but with a finer more modern approach. He is truly sophisticated but with some rough edges that catch and tear at the ear with both humor and intelligence. Fine direction by Martin Campbell pushes the action, the actors and ultimately the audience to new heights of action and romance. He shows us in the most jaw dropping way that to kill someone is not easy; it is a messy hard and dirty job. And you can get bloody in the process. Bravo for putting the grit back into Bond. Then there is the cast, a stunning array of international talent and indeed some of the finest actors around today shine and sparkle forever like diamonds in this film. Eva Green as Vesper Lind is by far the best ""Bond Girl"" to date. She is an actress of great range and talent that brings Vesper to heart stopping life. Her talent combined with great writing and direction has amalgamated in this film to create what may be the only fully rounded and human ""Bond Girl"" ever seen. Mads Mikkelsen is astonishingly good as the villain Le Chiffre is a real delight to watch. This is no ""Dr. Evil"" but a cold desperate criminal who when cornered is liable to go nuts on you. Here Judi Dench is given her most complex ""M"" to date and carries if off with her very special gifts as an actress. She as always is a delight. And in this film you learn a few things about ""M"" that might surprise you. Then there is Daniel Craig who makes his debut as Bond. And boy's roll out the red carpet and put up the velvet ropes. This performance will bring him to the forefront of movie stars who are also exceptional actors. This is a man who can act, and yet never let you catch him at it. A talent that ranks with the top fine actors today such as Russell Crowe, He inhabits this very rough and dangerous Bond at the birth of the character and gives us a hot, hard, thug who though the course of the film is transformed by human design and circumstance into ""Bond, James Bond"". He is simply breathtaking to watch. The film has a brain and also tips it's hat to great thrillers of the past especially ""North By Northwest"" as exemplified by the very sexy and delightful train scene where Bond and Vesper meet for the first time. But the most surprising aspect of ""Casino Royale"" is how human it is and how heartbreakingly romantic it can be amid the very dirty business of international espionage. this spcial two disc blue-ray edition is stunning to behold with a perfect picture and window shattering sound. The extras are simply grand as well. This movie at last brings magic back to the movies and heart to the Bond franchise.",positive
"Bond is back. I am one of the few that liked Qantam better, but still my second favorite Bond film.",positive
"Huge fan of Sean Connery as 007, but this may be the best Bond movie.",positive
"A fantastic comeback for the epitome of the spy genre. Apart from the controversy surrounding the fact that Daniel Craig is actually blonde, a very big faux pas for die-hard Bond fans, it is my (controversial) opinion that Craig is the best Bond to date, even competing with Connery's Bond. This movie is fantastic, with sharp dialogue, a clever plot, amazing stunts and, of course, fabulous wheels. The added touch of keeping the ""Bond, James Bond"" line til the end of the film was just wonderfully well thought out. FAVOURITE SCENE ~ The opening parkour segment in the construction site thrust parkour into our minds and into our Youtube videos, as well as making for some spine-tingling action.",positive
I'm not a Bond fan but I enjoyed this. The opening sequence was really good,negative
I dig Craig as the new Bond. The film has a few problems though..... Worth a watch.,negative
"As someone who enjoyed all the previous Bond Movies I am not sure about this one - yes its well crafted and has excellent action with a powerful lead but it lacks smoething for me. its a little too close to the Jack Baur, Jason Bourne and not Bond enough for me............ Still a good film.",negative
1st bond movie i ever watched and i liked it.,negative
"omfg the ""blonde bond"" Daniel Craig revises the role of the famous 007 spectacularly.And with Judi Dench reprising her role as 'M',you just have phenomenal acting,explosions,romance... what more could you want?",positive
"I love this movie out of all the bond movies ever made and I'm a Bond enthusiast to the max. I was so hesitant on seeing this film because it wasn't the usual Bond's everyone was used to. However, I have been wrong because Daniel Craig might just be the best Bond out there",positive
"Badass all the way through. Wasn't sure about Craig as Bond, but turns out he's perfect for the part.",positive
"Brilliant performances by both Daniel and Eva. Unlike most Bond Films, the pace of this movie doesn't die off. It was very well directed",positive

"The movie gets points for going out of it's way to be the anti-Bond Bond movie. But, we get it. Point made. It would be a decent action movie if A) there were more of it and B) it didn't have an insufferable amount of long plot exposition scenes.",negative
Best Bond Movie! And that is a bold statment for me.,positive

"I have mixed signals... this is more realistic, but I don't think Craig is that good a Bond.",negative
"Craig effortlessly upgrades Bond, with stylish and assured directon, thrilling set-pieces and a focused, smart storyline that was always absent from the franchise. Possibly the best Bond film yet.",positive
vrai James bond super impresionnant!! il ne devrait pas tomber amoureux aussi facilement ceci dit...,positive
Going into this movie I thought I would not like it as much as the Sean Connery Bonds. But Daniel Craig did an excellent job of reinventing the character of Bond.,positive

My Favorite Bond book finally made into a serious movie! Daniel Craig is Ian Fleming's James Bond; to a T. He is awesome and made the movie. I loved it.,positive
Was pretty good. The opening song had me captured straight away... Very awesome. Good stunts and Daniel Craig in tiny swim trunks is always a plus for a movie.,positive

so disappointed by this one!,negative
Great movie but the card game lasted too long. The ending was also kind of shallow.,positive
"This wasn't the best Bond movie, but it certainly wasn't the worst. I like the rugged appeal that Daniel Craig gives Bond, but unfortunately it was at the expense of his Suave appeal. Still it is much better than I had expected. The action is great, and this movie gives Bond an actual humanity behind the cardboard hero image that we have learned to love. I highly recommend it.",negative
"I am not a huge fan of Daniel Craig's James Bond- although they managed to show one of the best Bond Torture scenes EVER!! I give him at least 2-3 more movies, before they need to replace him",positive
The James bond franchise is one of the biggest franchises in the history of film and the last James bond was very ok. But Casino Royale comes to the rescue and fails. With a new bond this guy must be almost invincible. There isnt a lot of charisma with Daniel Craig or nothing up to the standard of the previous bonds. This movie is more centered on action and as a chase scene is filmed well the rest is not very good. Its quite unrealistic but I let that slip as it?s a James bond film. Overall this is not as good as it could have been but some scenes show some potential.,negative
Daniel Craig has resurrected 007!,negative
best Bond since Sean Connery,positive
"Casino Royale is a true james bond film.Stylish and moves at the perfect pace.Now i never knew who Daniel Craig was until this film was released.And since then i have loved his acting.Well lets see the poster.Its slick and has that OO7 this just like its sequel. The plot:The plot takes bond to a casino and has to capture a bad guy.And theres some other stuff but thats esentially it.If you seen other bond movies then you know the jist of it.Now while there bond gets a hot lady to have sex with(Trust me its not rare for that to happen in 007 movies)and she betrays him.....eh she gets what coming to her.And so the plot is good. The action:Every bond movie has to have some gun fights,car chases,and EXPLOSIONS.And this movie has a little less then others.But when there is it kicks some major ass.Needless to say its some of best i ever seen(Sorry michael bay).And for the most part it builds up suspense to when bond gets poisened.And then it goes on...and on and on.So i give it credit for haveing suspense,action,And a thrilling climax. The final verdict:Overall Casino Royale is one best movies i have ever seen.The suspense is incredeble,The action is fantastic,The acting is magnifecent,and the climax is insane.Honestly its a masterpeice.A 10/10!",positive
LOVE the new James Bond! I would take story and good acting any day of the week over the cheese balls that were the James Bond of Pierce. I drool over the design of the opening credits every time! I want the purple dress Eva wears the first night of gambling. The sound track is enjoyable also.,positive
I'd have rated it higher but I cannot stand Daniel craig as bond.,negative
I thought Daniel Craig was going to bomb at Bond. I was so wrong...,positive
"I liked the realism in the franchise, unlike Quantum they did not feel the need to jet around the world and have a solid 45 minutes of action.",positive
BOND....James bond^^,positive
"A good action flick, good stunts, hot girls, new Aston which could have been put in a car chase somehow..hint hint...somehow a ford focus got in the movie. But besides this a well put together movie. The Opening Chase scene is probably one of the best out there. Daniel Craig puts a solid performance in, however he resembles more of an american gladiator than a bond. There were a few times i forgot i was watching a bond movie. Overall good movie",negative
"Craig shines in this reboot of the Bond franchise. They managed to combine the feeling of the old school Connery Bond films, with modern action. For the first time in a long time, Bond feels fresh and not weighted down by a 45 year history.

"This felt like old Bond. I hated Brosnan and his elegant behavior...Bond is a killer and should act accordingly. From the black and white opening scenes to the smiling conclusion, you take a trip with Bond. This movie had absolutely no scenes where you knew what lay ahead before Bond did...you found out with the character and that made for one of the most exciting movie experiences I've ever had...rarely does any movie give me chills and this did. The music subtley referenced the theme music we all know, the first time putting on the tux had three held notes beging to continue into the theme, and finally, after we hear the cliche'd ""Bond, James Bond"", a smirk sends you smashing into the theme for the first time in the movie, telling you that Bond is gonna rock your world again.",positive
"This is how Bond should be. Captured the story so well, defined the character and he was more ruggid and kick ass. When you think its over, it isnt. One of the best films I have ever seen.",positive

"There is always going to be an outcry when dealing with characters or films that people hold dear to their heart. Some people have a thirty-some year bond with... um... Bond. So their hesitancy toward accepting a kickass action/intriguing spy flick. When you're in an abusive relationship, it's sometimes hard to break away from it. I'm not judging you if Die Another Day is your favorite film, but maybe you should take another look in the mirror. You can't say you fell down the stairs forever. That being said, Bond is blonde, get over it. Craig steps into the well-used spy shoes and breathes new invigorating life into the franchise. Campbell shapes a well-shot film from the first of Ian Flemming's books. Its biggest flaw is that it's a bit long, but if it did't set up the next in the series, Quantum of Solace wouldn't have been as awesome as it was. Casino Royale is exciting. http://thisguyoverhere.com/2006-films/casino-royale-2006/",positive

Don't like Daniel Craig's Bond,negative
"I'm not a fan of the Bond films, but this revival and perhaps Daniel Craig changed my mind. I held off seeing this movie for a long time. Everyone was telling me how good it was, but 007 films were a no-no for me. The ones I'd seen previous to this hadn't really made much impact on me. Eventually though, I switched it on, and to my surprise, got sucked in. Craig is perfect as James Bond. Charming, tough and quirky. I found that I really liked him. The story of the movie is great, and often intense. The action is there big time. Some fantastic sequences. Plus, there's a big helping of bad guys and babes. Great movie. Too bad the sequel wasn't up to scratch.",positive
47minutes of watching uninteresting Cast play Poker. i didn't enjoy this film at all. the only reason why it was remotely bare able is because i have faith in Daniel Craig and believe he has potential to make a good James Bond. also the scene with the Airport was a good Classic Bond Sequence.,negative
Jaw dropping and explosive.,positive
"daniel craig sets a new high standard in the bond saga, best of the series, both for lead actor and movie overall",positive
"good, but the whole poker scene was boring.",negative
never liked james bond,negative
its hard to get used to the new bond but he does a good job!,positive
"Die Another Day was an embarrassment to the 007 lore. With this high-profile reboot, Daniel Craig brings a freshness and intensity to Bond not seen since Sean Connery in Goldfinger while keeping the core mechanics of the franchise intact.",positive
Loved this movie. It is by far the most accurate version of Ian Fleming's idea of James Bond. No gimicks or gadgets just strength and brains. Love it.,positive
"Great movie, more realistic than the other Bond films, with their stupid gadgets in them",positive
"When I found out that Daniel Craig would be Bond, I was disappointed. I just didnt see the fit. I must say that he did a good job and the movie was well done.",negative
"Not a fan of the new Bond, sorry...",negative
disappointing storyline practically neuters Bond. bleh,negative
Best Bond film ever! They minimized the ridiculous cliches and made Bond an actual person. Good stuff.,positive
"A very interesting choice for the new James Bond. To me, He has the young hard arrogance of Sean Connery, but with the cold edge of Timothy Dalton.",negative
"Super awesome movie. This movie is rich in color, picture, language and card playing. I like the bad guys and especially the bond girls. M's character is telling and riveting. The new Aston Martin is phoenominal as well. This is a standard you judge most any action movie after. Definitely my favorite bond movie.",positive
Pretty good. Intense for a Bond movie. Still like Brosnan best.,negative
new bond and at his best,positive
MMMM DANIEL CRAIG IS ONE OF THE BEST JAMES BOND EVER!!!!,positive
James Bond is back and better than ever! a return to the grounded Bond movies in the vein of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. Daniel Craig shines in a role that fits him like a well tailored glove.,positive
"The Bond franchise was becoming stale, this Bond hits the spot.",positive
Craig is incredible as Bond.,positive
"After Pierce Brosnan left there was Daniel Craig and he was really changed james Bonds personality a lot. he's still a stiff, but Daniel Craig as James Bond is like the new Jason Bourne. However there's something about him that just isn't right. Bond is finally back.",positive
"Crap, not a real bond movie. Felt more like a Jason Bourne movie, which would have been fine but not as a bond movie.",negative
not a fan of the mushy beach romance. I'm glad Bond grew a pair in later years,negative
"I decided to watch this again and re-review it since I went over my old review and thought it was unfair, boy am I glad I watched it again. I love the Bond series, not very many movies I haven't liked from the series (only one that I would give a rotten rating) and this is up there with the best of them. Daniel Craig is fantastic as Bond not only is he able to do all the action himself but he also gives Bond emotion and a heart which has been lacking in the last couple of Bond movies. The rest of the cast is also really good (especially Eva Green and Judi Dench), the action is really good and feels fresh and inventive, it looks stunningly beautiful yet gritty, love the pre-title sequence which is shot entirely in black and white, the main theme song is really good (first male singer since the 80s), the plot is gripping and the end twist I didn't see coming and though this film ditches a lot of the original Bond traditions it still has the one thing that has been through all Bond movies and that is a sense of humor no matter what the situation Bond has to confront.",positive
Daniel Craig is a more hard core n less gadget type james bond.....i thought he did a fair job,negative
"I'm not a particular fan of James Bond, but this movie really impressed me.",positive
defo the better bond!,positive
loveit its spectacular,positive
RUBBISH! The only awesome things was the cars and houses!,negative
"Decent, but he needs more charisma",negative
"Daniel Craig is my second favorite Bond, just next to Sean Connery. Simply because his character is suppose to be a new double-O agent, skilled and experience, but has not yet found his style and place. He still thinks of his mission before himself, but also thinks of his ego before his country. Fortunately he found someone who makes him believe something more, and that makes the audience believe he will eventually become Connery's Bond. This movie is more brawn than gadget, more action than sex, more character developing than character showcase, more story telling than meaningless banter, I believe this Bond film is the best one since Sean Connery retired from 007. However, I found the pace of movie slows down somehow towards the end, and Vesper's role is not defined very clearly, though Eva Green is absolutely sexy, it makes you forget all the flaws and want to just enjoy her screen time.",positive
Daniel Craig is the greatest 007 actor ever,positive
"This is I believe the best Bond movie. I think that Daniel Craig is better than Sean Connery. Craig is not the superman that previous Bond's were. He's tougher and he makes mistakes. He a more realistic portrayal of what a spy might be. I am glad they did away with all the crazy gadgets. A lot of them were just laughable. Like the cloaking car in one of the Brosnan films. It's not silly like the Brosnen movies, and has a strong, interesting story. The action scenes are impressive. There are several big ones and all of them could have been grand finales they were so good. Great opening action scene and good villain. Eva Green is a great choice, and Judi Dentch is great also. Dentch as M really is a good choice I'm glad they kept her for this reboot of Bond. Even if you don't like Bond don't let that stop you from missing out on this great action movie. Even if it wasn't Bond as the hero it would still be an amazing action movie.",positive
the best 007 movie since from russia with love,positive
"9.7/10 One of the best 2006 films i have ever watched, Casino Royale packs a heavy blow and Daniel Craig performs a Stunning Performance as Bond. The Torture Scene may of been a little weird, but the film itself is incredible. Daniel Craig and Eva Green are a good team. The film takes place in Prague, and James Bond has earned his 00 status. Mr.White meets with Le Chiffre and Obanno. James Bond continues as Agent 07 and proceeds on into the country. The film's storyline is great and the cinema is good aswell. I hope you find as much fun in the film as I did, for i know that this is one of the best films of 2006.",positive
Needs less story and more gadgets to be a proper Bond flick!,negative
after all of the hype that Daniel Craig does not deserve to be James Bond (I'm one of them... rooting for Clive Owen to be the next bond)... I think Craig did his job to humanize James Bond and Eva green is just jaw-dropping gorgeous.... nicely done... all of the James Bond elelments are really for Craig...,positive
Best bond movie ever,positive
"The most perfect James Bond film. Serious yet not serious. Realistic, yet not realistic. Perfect writing, directing, and acting from newcomer Dan Craig. Great song by Cornell as well. One of my favorites!",positive
one of the best bond EVER!,positive
This is perhaps the best Bond movie made. It captures the Bond effect without the silly rockets-in-cars and high tech weapons.,positive
CRAIG IS BOND! THE BEST BOND EVER! In Casino Royale we find that the Bond franchise can not only be remade but it can be reborn better than ever!,positive
great action thriller,positive
"I never really liked nor disliked Bond movies, and didn't see most of them, especially the last fifteen years. This one was great. Very smart. Now I'm reading for QoS and then Skyfall soon enough!",positive
To this day I still don't entirely know what was up with that rope torture scene.,negative

"I'm not a bond fan and haven't seen many of them, but I think Daniel Craig is pretty good in the role and I really enjoyed this film, it was fairly epic - full of action and completely gripping.",positive
he would kick indiana's arse,positive
This movie was so great it gave me chills!A must see for Daniel Craig fans.,positive
This Daniel Craig makes me sick.,negative
Revamps the Bond series after Pierce Brosnan stagnated it slowly. Has an absolutely stellar chase scene on foot.,positive
"Entertaining, visceral, exciting. This is the perfect Bond film, with a great performance by Craig, great turns from the supporting cast, exciting chase scenes, and the best Poker game sequence ever put to film.",positive
Slick and well thought out with a very intense and excellent daniel craig as james bond.,positive
"Bond comes blazing back onto the screen in the best movie since 1969's 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. This 'reboot' of the series was blatantly necessary as it was clear from the latter Brosnan films that the series that stuck to that formula had by far run its course. And this movie still delivers the frenetic action scenes that we are used to seeing in Bond pictures, only this time Bond is presented as human, he bleeds and gets hurt, and there is therefore more at stake; you don't feel that he is merely a cartoon character who cannot die. Craig delivers a phenomenal performance as Bond; he combines the quick wit and suavity that we are used to with vulnerability, his arrogance is presented as a weakness and there are points where, yes, he gets it totally wrong. Only criticism: the final action scene feels like one too many.",positive
LOVE daniel craig as bond. he doesn't even need a gun! hotttt,positive
"Casino Royale reboots James Bond on the silver screen after 44th years, mixing a decent star and tight, fast direction into what really feels like the best film to date. The best, you say? Does that mean it's the most fun? No. If there's such a thing as ""Not corny enough for Bond"", Casino Royale is it. This is a harsh, somber movie that often falters with its creativity. We get a fuel truck running rampant on a landing strip, tons of intense poker, a wrestling match at the top of a pair of construction cranes, a water-filled elevator, an African-American version of Bond's CIA counterpart Felix Leiter, a quiet train ride in which NOTHING thrilling occurs, and then a bit of nut torture for good measure. It's exciting and it's interesting, but it's all a little plain and grim underneath. That makes it realistic, certainly, but I'm not sure anybody watches Bond for a shot of reality. In fact, there was a minor uproar when the producers warned that this movie wouldn't even have gadgets! The warning suits the style of film, but rest easy nonetheless, because a portable defibrillator, superb computer and cell-phone technology, and a sub-dermal tracking beacon seemed to work fine as gadgets as far as I'm concerned. And then, on top of that, the harsh reality of the picture gets further balance from Craig's 007. He knows when and how to rattle off his quips, and very little seems to strike him as without humour. This Bond has the unblinking brutality he needs to get the job done, but never once abandons the guile and charm that make us love him. Granted, he consistently fails at speaking clearly and really just looks wrong for the part (like a man older than 1962's Sean Connery playing a man younger than 1962's Sean Connery), but he takes this role and plays the hell out of it -- and looks like he's having fun. Which means we can have fun, too. Besides a harsher more reality-based film, and some issues around identifying Bond inside the new star, Casino Royale's clean direction, break-neck pacing, and smart writing mean any fan of cinema will love this adventure. Die hard James Bond fans might have a rougher time warming up to it, but there's enough heart and care in this thing that eventually even they should let it be.",positive
this one was better than its sequel by far.,positive
I am very sad that it doesnt show the original smooth and sharp James Bond but I am glad that the producers used the Casino Royale as a movie.,positive
One of my all time favorites,positive
"Incredible. From the opening chase scene (one of the best ever made, and its all ON FOOT), to the climatic ending, Daniel Craig reinvents the iconic legend, James Bond. And it is truly AWESOME. Fantastic visuals, tough, gritty action, Bond never looked so cool, or so deadly, as he does in Casino Royale. Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond reverses the whole Bond universe. Instead of the sauve ladies man, with all of his little gadgets and toys, we get a solemn, remorseless killing machine. A hitman-esque rogue who's not afraid to shoot first and ask questions later. In Casino Royale, Bond has just earned his 00 status and his ""license to kill,"" after dispatching a corrupt MI6 agent in a great black and white opening scene. He travels to the Bahamas in an effort to gain more information on La Chiffre, a rich profiteer, that uses the stock market and gambling tactics (and dubatchery), to launder blood money for terrorists and war-torn countries. Action, drama, and romance still abound. But not like one would suspect in a typical Bond movie. Craig carries out his own brand of justice and lays down the law on anyone that crosses him, leaving behind an ever increasing body count. Directed by Martin Campbell, Casino Royale is a major step away from the normal gun toting, lady killer Bond has portrayed for so many years. Gorgeous settings (it was filmed all over the world), fast-paced story, with intense, taut action, Casino Royale delivers on all levels of fine film making. A terrific movie, one that EVERYONE should take the time to enjoy, I loved it from start to finish.",positive
"Possibly the best Bond film ever. Daniel Craig gives Bond a new dimension showing it isn't all guns, gadgets and girls.",positive
Spennende og fresh Bond!,positive

We can watch this movie over and over.. It doesn't matter what day it is or how we feel- Its great every time.,positive
"It overstays its welcome by about twenty minutes, but Casino Royale successfully washes out the declining Bond franchise for a grittier, more intense Bond who succeeds quite well at what he's supposed to do.",positive
"Completely NOT what you'd expect from a James Bond movie: No ludicrous gadgets, no over-the-top villains, just smart action and writing. Mind-blowing, and easily the best Bond film.",positive
A good reboot for the Bond series which had become too cluttered with gadgets and camp,negative
"SO Suspenseful! I am so glad they revamped the series with this script. I wasn't too sure about Daniel Craig as the next James Bond, but he pulled it off. I especially like the black and white scenes in the beginning. SEE IT!",positive
"Have to admit, didnt think craig would be a good bond...but loved the last 2 movies",positive
"A great re-start of the franchise. A Bond Begins, so to speak. Bond seems like a person now -a sociopath, but a person. Everything seems more real and justified for a Bond film. Still, it is only a Bond film.",positive
"I'm a die hard Bond fan, been one since I was eleven years old, I've seen them all. Or so I thought. This latest installment in the long running franchise is nothing short of brilliant action entertainment it has all the elements, well almost all, that made the past Bond's so much fun to watch and that and more are the keys to this films massive success. Casino Royale takes us all the way back to before James Bond was a 00 and we get to see his rise to being the best secret agent around. This film disposes of the silliness and gadgetry that has plagued the previous Bond movies and it brings out the Bond we have been waiting to see: chaotic, haunted, vicious and ruthless. This film steps up the game and brings and proceeds non stop to take Bond to a whole new level. Daniel Craig(who deserves an Oscar by now.) plays Bond like no other. He puts out Bond aversion to getting dirty, sweaty, beaten up and bloody, he step's it up each time he put's the smack down on someone and put's his place as the number 2 greatest Bond in the franchise's history. Eva Green was alright, she wasn't the best looking Bond girl(trust me there have been better!) but she doers have a quiet subtlety to her character which is enough to get her by. Judi Dench is absolutely fantastic as ""M"" she brings a 45 year old character some class, style and tough motherly love. Jeffrey Wright as Bond;s oldest friend Felix Lighter is not as good as he could have been but he certainly is better than the people who played it before him, Wright brings allot of class and wit to Lighter. More so that he's had in the past and that makes him worthy of the role. But all in all the cat does splendid in there assigned part's and brings this film the direct power it needs. Casino Royale is powerful, dark, gritty, smart, Wild and crazy fun that is to be admired with the highest level of respect and gratitude. This film is a major, major notch above the rest of the Bond films and out classes and out fight's them in oh so many ways. This film is a favorite of mine and it's one that I can watch many times over It's a great love story and a great action film all at the same time; It moves across the screen with a pace that is easy to follow but yet at sometimes lightning fast. It's a great installment in the long running Bond series and will go down as one of the best. All in all Casino Royale delivers",positive
Better than Quantum.,negative

"<i><b>Bartender:</b> ""Would you like that shaken or stirred?"" <b>Bond:</b> ""Does it look like I give a damn.""</i><p> <i>Casino Royale</i> marks the start of a new Bond - Daniel Craig. Directed by Martin Campbell, the film boasts an impressive new Bond, a well written script, and some amazingly good action sequences. At the heart of it, there's totally new dark tone that we've never seen before in a Bond movie. <u>SUMMARY:</u><p> James Bond (Daniel Craig) earns his 00 status at the beginning of the film in stark monochrone. But he has a new villain to take care of. It seems that the banker to so-called freedom fighters, aka terrorists, is one Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), who has invested his clients' funds riskily. Needing to recoup $150 million, this mathematics genius decides to gamble all on a high stakes poker game at the Casino Royale in Montenegro against Bond of course. Bond is funded by the British Treasury to the tune of 15 million pounds. The delivery person and holder of the purse strings is Vesper Lynd(Eva Green). She's not your classic bikini clad Bond woman but she's a babe. <u>REVIEW:</u><p> This is an adaptation of Ian Flemming's novel of the same name, and the great thing about it is the poker. Huge fans of the card game should have a blast with all the poker games through the film, since we don't get a lot of movies based around poker very often. Bond in this film is so different from most of the James Bonds we usually see - he's got a dark side to him. Some of the other characters aren't your typical Bond types - Vesper Lynd is hot, but isn't the Bond girl who walks around in a bikini holding a gun. Also, Le Chiffre is more of a psychological baddie - he doesn't know how to fight like many Bond villains we see these days, but the stuff he does shows that he is an effective villain. The dialogue here is enjoyable. There isn't as much humour, but there are a few witty lines which still give Bond that classic smartass attitude. In terms of the plot, there are a number of very subtle twists that you'll never see coming, and it links back to the contention of the film towards Bond - <i>Trust No One.</i> Lastly, Bond does fall in love here. In many other Bond films, particually Brosnan's Bond, the character's 'love' isn't convincing - all he is doing is being a total man whore. With <i>Casino Royale</i>, the love Bond finds feels real to the audience. Daniel Craig plays Bond with style. I'm sure girls will enjoy his six-pack, while males will surely find his performance badass. He knows how to take on the dark side of the agent, and he delivers his dialogue with confidence. He is absolutely the best Bond since Connery. Eva Green is stunningly gorgeous as Vesper Lynd, playing a very unique Bond girl. She captures the feisty side of Lynd well, and also manages to show us the soft side of her character. She and Craig have chemistry - and that's why the love between Bond and Lynd is so darn convincing. Mads Mikkelsen is very effective as Le Chiffre, and I also liked Giancarlo Giannini as Mathis, an informant of Bond. Again, Judi Dench returns as M. She does work well with Craig. There are some moments in the film with Bond and M that are truly entertaining. Bond films of the past have been crap due to the fact of how <b>silly</b> they were, for example <i>Die Another Day</i>. That film featured invisible cars with machine guns attached to them. Well, in <i>Casino Royale</i>, there isn't a touch of sci-fi. Everything is believable. The chase scene at the start of the movie is spectacular - Campbell stages these sequences with skill. All the action scenes of the film are mind-blowing ,and highly exciting. The score is terrific, and the cinematography is very <b>classy</b>. Then there's the locations. One of the highlights of the film is the locations. Shot in many different countries, <i>Casino Royale</i> has a large range of shooting locations, and they all look great. Also, keep an eye out for one of the most brutal torture scene's I've ever seen. Overall, <i>Casino Royale</i> is the best Bond film ever, and one of the most enjoyable. There are thrills even during the poker scenes. Daniel Craig makes an impressive debut as the new Bond, and all the action set pieces should keep you on the edge of your seat. Ditch Prosnan, you're better off with Craig. <div style=""width:450px;""><a href=""http://www.flixster.com/photos/casino-royale2006-daniel-craig-11089490""><img src=""http://content8.flixster.com/photo/11/08/94/11089490_gal.jpg"" border=""0""/></a><div style=""text-align:center;font-size:10px;"">",positive

It all gives Bond a new dimension. Craig has done far more in one movie than half of the bonds put together have. Previous movies were so over engineered... this one actually looks like it could be real. So many plot twists... edge of your seat stuff....

action packed bt.....,negative
top notch but too long,positive
"Daniel Craig steps into Bond's shoes in yet another reboot of this epic franchise, and takes it to some very good places. At first, Craig's gritty take on a character that is usually much smoother and sophisticated seemed off, but by the end of the movie, we have a much more solid and real picture of Mr Bond, what is behind the drive that lets him keep going when most people would simply run out of steam. We get to see this drive in action numerous times, and each time it becomes clearer that this man will stop at nothing. The shift in tone makes the film much more realistic - no more flying off to space (Moonraker) or ridiculous evil lairs (Dr. No). The tongue is strictly out of the cheek here, replaced by a grim determination and recognition that the world is a nasty place, and even those who try to stop the Bad Guys have their nasty side. This is definitely James Bond in a post 9/11 world. (Even the darkest of Timothy Dalton plots wasn't this realist...) The action continues as expected, though again without any tone of campiness - in fact, the action has some seriously dark overtones at times. And even the nastiest of previous Bond villains has never simply and brutally tortured Bond, in a scene that could have come from the Coen Brothers or Quentin Tarantino. Once I adjusted to the change in tone, I was able to really appreciate what this change means for this venerable franchise. Bond now has the chance to be an ongoing and outstanding series of excellent ""realist"" spy flick (sic), in the vein of the Bourne series. Now I can't wait to see Quantum of Solace...!",positive
Daniel Craig is the BEST James Bond!! Excellent performance!!,positive
has one of my favourite cinematic scenes ever!,positive
Pra mim foi o melhor 007,positive
Daniel Craig is not my Bond... I find that the stories are losing a purpose other than to have him chase people.,negative
"9.8/10- James Bond is a character that is seen differently through many viewers minds. There have been six actors to portray James Bond over the span of decades, and each actor brought different traits to the table of the character. Depending on your preference, you may or may not be willing to accept the style of which Daniel Craig delivers. This film is intended as a reboot. Bond gains his double-O status shortly after the film begins, and is set loose by his secret service boss M(Judi Dench) to bring down Le Chiffe. Le Chiffe is in deep with the sharks, more specifically a world-wide terrorist organization. Le Chiffe has no money to repay his debts, and so must enter a sophisticated high-stakes poker game in Montenegro in hopes of winning the large amount of money. Bond is ordered to intercept by entering and winning the card game himself, as he is ""the best player in the service"". Along the way Bond will have to deal with not only Le Chiffe and his men, but the terrorist group who is after Le Chiffe as well. What is such a great element to the film is the woman who accompanies Bond on the mission, Vesper Lynd(Eva Green). She is in charge of the money given to Bond to bet in the game and is responsible for being the one who strips away decades of ignorant womanizing and expendable plot devices. Initially Bond and Vesper are like oil and water, but as the plot progresses Bond becomes more attached to her and vice-versa. She is a beautiful woman, but her intelligence and independence intrigues Bond in a genuine way. By the end of the film the viewer cares for Vesper probably more than any other ""Bond girl"" in the franchise's history, because of the way that she appeals to Bond's cold heart and how affected by her he seems to be toward the film's end. This is the most important element that separates Casino Royale from older James Bond films. A more obvious change in the character of Bond is grittiness. Craig is lean and his body makes us believe that he has gone through years of intense training, something that has never really been stressed in a Bond film before. Craig's take on the character is more of a blunt design. The James Bond in Casino Royale will use raw power and force as apposed to finding a smarter and easier solution to his problems. Once scene shows Bond running after a terrorist through a construction site, and runs through a wall of sheet rock rather than simply find a door like Sean Connery(the original James Bond actor) would. He throws himself over a fence instead of climb over it or go around. Bond is a wreckless force without finesse, yet somehow he gets the job done and it is very satisfying to see it unfold. James Bond die-hards will have much to munch on here, or they may have much to curse about. Casino Royale is both classic Bond and a more fresh revision of the character. There is plenty here that stays true to what fans have come to expect from a Bond film, yet it throws away all of the silly gadgets and cheesy dialog that made the series so famous, and Casino Royale pulls it off fantastically. This is a great addition to the Bond series. The film has ell choreographed action that is similar to what we have seen from films like The Bourne series, yet Casino Royale seems to have more style and balances it with substance as well. Good character development between Bond and the beautiful woman, a trait that is non-existent in a Bond film until now. Complex plot and villains are realistic and believable, unlike previous Bond films. If you are a fan of the Bond series, you may love this new yet still similar take on Bond, or you may abhor it. Regardless, Casino Royale is a fantastic achievement that shows more modern spy films and shows like ""24"", ""Mission Impossible"", and ""The Bourne"" series how a spy film is really made.",positive

oohhh i like this film!,positive
Daniel Craig will you marry me...,positive
"Casino Royale is the best Bond movie in a long, long time. It kicks off with a scene that tops any foot chase scene ever filmed, and then continues on from there, never letting up until the end. The story revolves around 007 just as he is starting out. He doesn't quite have a name for himself yet, but he'll be damned if he doesn't make an impression right away. And he succeeds in doing so. Daniel Craig is a very good Bond, but he is not the best; just a very good upgrade from Pierce Brosnan, whose movies centered around the silly gadgets he would use to get out of impossible situations. In Casino Royale, the gadgets are thrown out the window and are replaced with fists and intellect. Eva Green even does great job as a less conventional Bond girl. On a side note, the scenery in the movie is absolutely beautiful. Everything seems to be very well thought out. The stunts are great and even the poker scenes are done extremely well. Casino Royale should be a breath of fresh air to any real Bond fan. Packed with top notch action, a great story, and gritty realism, this flick brings the Bond series back to life.",positive
Best James Bond movie ever. Hands down.,positive
i love mads more than my own life!,positive
loved it! one of my fave bond movies,positive
"When I first saw it, I thought it would be among the year's best films. Now, I would the call it the best film of its year. The action is terrific, but for a Bond film, it's incredible. In the film, 007, now played by Daniel Craig, heads to Montenegro for a poker tournament in order to find and stop his enemy, Le Chiffre, played by Mads Mikkelsen. Along the way, he meets Vesper Lynd, played by Eva Green, and a romantic relationship forms between the two. The poker tournament is exciting thanks to the strong performances from everyone involved, which also includes strong acting from Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter. Director Martin Campbell has certainly stepped up his game to make a thrilling picture with an empowering story. Eva Green gives a very good performance as always, and Daniel Craig, as the new James Bond, is remarkable. I'm honestly tired of the people who say ""It's not James Bond unless it's Sean Connery."" I just might call Daniel Craig the best Bond, but I'd have to see more from him first.",positive
"Shallow yes, but so are the bonds in general. Entertaining and caught the bonds spirit more than well. Maybe a bit too long though.",negative
Daniel Craig is a great Bond,positive
Daniel Craig is a great new Bond!!,positive
Best of the bonds that I've seen. The only one that seems in anyway different from the rest.,negative
A great restart for the Bond franchise,positive
dont find it. and i hate james bond.,negative
luv eva green in this movie!!!,negative
"WOW! That's all I can say about this one. Well, okay, more. I remember reading how Timothy Dalton wanted to make Bond into more of a darker character in Living Daylights, he tried with Licence To Kill, but still, it was James Bond with gimmicks galore. In Casino Royale, Martin Campbell seems to have forgotten he directed GoldenEye (which was also a pretty great Bond Flick) and puts out the most badass Bond imaginable. Mind you, purists will claim that this is not true Bond, no gadgets, no self depreciating humour, yadayada, and I can see one day someone making a Bond film that returns him to the gimmicky days of yore. Daniel Craig makes for an awesome Bond, one who's not 100% perfect, (his enemies are not exactly 100% perfect either) who delves into one hell of a case, one which involves Terrorists, a VERY high stakes poler game, and a funny eyed criminal. Even though this is 2 and a half hours long, it's all incredibly watchable, since it's non-stop excitement all the way, with all sorts of amazing stuff I can't even begin to describe. Since it DOES have Bond on it, and since it IS official, fuck it all, this is the Best Bond movie I've seen.",positive
"Pretty good, not standard Bond fare, but good change of pace for new Bond Daniel Craig",positive
Amazing movie. Job well done.,positive
"One of the most bangin chase/fight scenes I can recall in the past decade. Smart and sexy, the way Bond should be.",positive
to much freakin runnin in it.,negative
Seen just the begain seemed to drag on.,negative
This probably wasn't the best script to take on for an actor just stepping into the Bond role. I expected more action.,negative
Casino Royale was simply the best Bond film yet!!!,positive
I learned a few things from this movie: 1) Bond is a total sap 2) the MI5 likes Sony and 3) Daniel Craig makes a very convincing Bond.,positive
this will be debated forever i think daniel did ok and its bond and has aston martins in it,negative
"Maintains much of the old while bringing in some much needed fresh and new. Without a doubt, Casino Royale does more for Bond's character development than any other Bond film up to this point. Craig has become my personal favorite Bond. I have never been a fan of the Bond films, but the Bond image has been transformed with Craig. Craig can be colder than any Bond we've ever seen, and he also shows a personal quality that we've never seen. In short, Craig as Bond is bad ass, visceral, and refreshingly human. Watch this movie.",positive
"I have never really watched the old James Bond movies or the Pierce Brosnan movies, so this series is new to me. This is a great action movie with creative stunts and chases. Fun to watch and sort of starts the James Bond series with a clean slate. I'm definitely a fan of the new Bond now.",positive
Now this is how to make a bond film... best bond film since Goldfinger!,positive
"LOVE Daniel Craig. LOVE Bond movies. Didn't know how I'd feel about a blonde Bond at first, but it was AWESOME! Everything you'd expect from a modern-day Bond movie.",positive
"Dude, now this is a great James Bond movie. James Bond should be totally kick ass, and Daniel Craig really delivers. The only thing wrong with this movie is that it's just too damn long. Still, the best of the bunch in my opinion.",positive
this is bond at his best,positive
"A great shot of caffeine to a sleepy franchise. From opening to ending my friend and I were hooked. There's no Q but I'm actually okay with that fact as Desmond Lewellyn passed on and I'm sorry, I love John Cleese but NOT as Q. Craig is great, Dench is always fantastic and way to go to the director for getting two awesome European actors in Mikkelsen and Green whom are awesome as Le Chifre and Vesper.",positive
Great Bond interpretation for the 21st century.,positive
"my favorite movie of all time. it has everything: action, thriller, and romance all done with enough masculinity for the guys and enticing enough for the women. the story is smart and fun. the acting is top notch with mr. dainel Craig as mr bond, James bond.",positive
ALL of James Bonds films are totally off the chain!,positive
"Nunca me han gustado las películas de Bond, pero con esta me la pasé muy bien, escenas de acción bien ejecutadas, una historia medianamente interesante y Eva Green como chica Bond, entretenimiento palomitero a full.",negative
"If you are looking for a great Bond with a great story, great (REAL) stunts and a great actor, then this is it.",positive
really enjoyed this film :),positive
"Very well made movie, much better than the sequel, which was awful. Daniel Craig was stunning as James Bond, and the rest of the cast was great. Brilliantly directed, music was fantastic. No critisisms.",positive
"Para mi, la mejor de la saga Bond, así Daniel Craig no tenga la talla de Connery o Brosnan.",negative
I never thought I'd enjoy a Bond film not thinking of it as a Bond film but as a real movie. This one did it for me. Down with the haters of Craig's blond Bond. He pulled this one off beautifully.,positive
"Oj, for en nedtur, sånn Bond-messig. Helt ok actionfilm.",negative
Excellent movie. Great reboot. Daniel Craig is great.,positive
not the best bond ive ever seen,negative
Have loved Daniel Craig's Bond above all others.,positive
This is the one I saw...I it was good but lacked Bond appeal to me...,negative
Best Bond movie to date.,positive
"I enjoyed watching this movie, a great movie to watch...",positive
"Okay, but I was not impressed.",negative
"Casino Royale quickly dispatches the campiness of the previous James Bond films and basically shows that this Bond is not in it for the martinis, he's in it for the adrenaline, the violence, the rush, and the pure badassery. The best Bond film of all.",positive
Start of a new Bond generation got off to a fantastic start producing one of my favourite ones. Daniel Craig may not look like your typical Bond but he plays the role brilliantly as he goes from Madagascar to Bahamas following leads and in Montenegro following Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) in Montenegro via a high stake poker game. There is much more to just Le Chiffre which makes this film so good. Its entertaining as most Bond films are but on the whole it was a flawless film,positive
Don't like the newest Bond.,negative
Craig is not bond material. Not the typical...,negative
The first Bond film that I actually got into.,positive

What a great beginning to a new era of Bond!,positive
"Daniel Craig's reinvention of the James Bond character came at just the right time. Following DIE ANOTHER DAY, perhaps the worst in a series of films that has quite a few turkeys to its credit, Craig takes on the role and brings a great deal of respectability to it and finally helps to bring Ian Fleming's creation to the screen in the way that it was intended. What really stands out about CASINO ROYALE is that this is a film that is about James Bond, a first for the franchise. Generally, the films revolve more around the villain and his nefarious scheme. Not this time, this is a movie about James Bond himself. The villain's scheme is relatively small scale (compared to schemes of the past), with the film focusing more on Bond's personal and professional growth as he learns lessons in love, trust, and betrayal. To say that Daniel Craig's performance is masterful is a severe understatement. Craig, in just one film, cements himself as the quintessential Bond actor, surpassing the standard set before him by his five predecessors. Daniel Craig is Ian Fleming's James Bond, coming closer to faithfully bringing the character to the screen than we've ever seen. Craig handles all aspects of the character with ease, from the physical aspects, making for a very convincing agent when things get rough, to the humor as well as the romance. What really sets CASINO ROYALE apart from the rest of the Bond films is that it is not a film that relies solely upon the talent of the actor portraying Bond. CASINO ROYALE marks one of the very few times in which the supporting cast of a Bond film measures up to the talent of its lead actor. Eva Green costars as Vesper Lynd, and in doing so, crafts what should be remembered as the best of the Bond women. In fact, Green nearly steals the show from Craig, despite only appearing in half of the film. The scenes in which she shares with Craig rank amongst the absolute best in the entire franchise, with the two leads sharing a fantastic on-screen chemistry that has been lacking in the films since, perhaps, the very beginning. The performances are so good that it is really a shame that both were overlooked for Oscar nominations, especially in a very weak year (2006) for film. Both performances were very much deserving of the recognition of an Oscar nomination in the lead acting categories. The only criticism that can be mustered up for CASINO ROYALE is that it is way too front-loaded with action. As good as the film is, a much better film could have been made had the first hour or so of the film been cut entirely, and instead spend more time on the casino sequences and the budding romance between Bond and Vesper. The Venice sequences towards the end of the film should have been better than they are, as in their current form they rush through the final events of Fleming's novel which are actually some of the more interesting events of the storyline. CASINO ROYALE markes a return to form of sorts for the Bond franchise. It ranks right near the top of the list of a few quality films that the franchise has to its credit, which would include DR. NO, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS, and LICENCE TO KILL. This is, thanks in large part, due to Daniel Craig's spectacular performance as Bond, which should give the producers many great options for further storylines now that they have an actor who can take the character to a great number of interesting places it has never been before.",positive
"The beginning of a new era. Brilliant. I am a huge fan of the originals, this is pre-gadget Bond. <3",positive
"WOOOOOOOT! the names bond, james bond.. James Bond is my IDOL!!!!!!! Daniel Craig as the new james bond was fantastic! usually you would think of the james bond to have black or dark brown hair with mysterious eyes, but he has blonde hair with blue eyes and he is such a great actor he just brings an edge to his character. Filled with great action scenes, like all of the other james bond films, it was a MUST-SEE",positive
"a really sick scene in the middle, nasty, but it doesnt really complete a story. unless your a die hard bond fan dont see it",negative
"daniel craig, what more can I say.",positive
This is possibly the best Bond film ever made.,positive
Too serious and bloody for a Bond film,negative
"Awesome, love the Sean Connery bond series and I think Daniel Craig is filling his shoes quite well!",positive
They already said it. The best James Bond movie ever.,positive
Not the best James Bond movie but entertaining.,negative
"Great movie, great remake of the Jamse Bonde series.",positive
"I think Daniel Craig is the best Bond out of the lot. At first I was a bit skeptical from the announcing of this new one. Even watching the trailers soon after. But, after viewing the film, I knew that he was the perfect and hopefully the last James Bond actor. Craig is also in much better shape physically. He carries that charming and relaxed demeanor that made James Bond so addicting and improves on it. It's nice to see this film brings more action to the series. From start to finish it doesn't let up. It also proves that you shouldn't trust anyone. James Bond always had run-ins with beautiful and exotic women and in this one there is no change. This film shows his greatest challenge with love and how not to be that vulnerable with it again. He can also play a torture victim quite well. A scene that made my respect for Bond all the more greater. The best James Bond film to date. Bravo, Daniel Craig.",positive
"Craig is the best of them. Even better than Brosnan, sorry",positive
daniel craig is old but sooooo sexyy =P,positive
Best James Bond film. Daniel Craig definitely has the manner of the urbane super spy. I look forward to more with him.,positive
"Loved it...Daniel Craig is a pretty dencent Bond, and this was a great start for him I thought.",positive
Good back to old skool,positive
way girlier than i thought itd be,negative
surprisingly he is a good james bond,positive
The best Bond movie EVER!!!,positive
"The BEST bond film ever! Good character developement, a Bond that is vulnerable and even helpless at times. Didn't objectify women as much as the previous films, which I applaud.",positive
"Immensely slow plot line at times, overrated action sequences...",negative
almost verbatim to the book.,positive
"Excellent reboot of the bond series. I felt a little sorry for Brosnan because I thought he was the best Bond looks-wise since Connery. But after the invisible car and the laser and all the assorted crap that turned Bond into a two-hour advertisment for James Bond toys, this film was sorely needed. Great story, great characterisation, great action. What more do you need?",positive
loved this movie...alot of action!!!,positive
"Hehe, he ran through a wall...",positive
I am not a die hard 007 through the ages fan but this movie is worth the action alone.,positive

Chilling first bond movie. Fuck the cliches of yesterday. Hooray for the breath of fresh air!!,positive
"although i know it's supposed to be an exposition to put bond in context, it's still too soft for bond",negative
"This Bond film was very close in the way the Ian Flemming novels were written, a great start for Daniel Craig.",positive
"The name's Blond, James Blond. Although many spit in the face of this movie, one has to recognize what the director was aiming for. Bond is not the womanizer semi-ridiculous judo-chopper that he was before. Now he is a kick-you-in-the-face badass motha****** womanizer! Less gadgets, more realistic fighting, and ridiculously cars (that now don't last 5 minutes). Daniel Craig took Bond to a whole new level!",positive
"Ive always been a James Bond fan, and i'm glad to see they are finally making Bond films that have the same tone that the books have. a more gitty and real feel.",negative

not as good as the rest,negative
So I was wrong about the blond Bond...converted!,positive

Hot damn this is goooood.,positive

"Merry Christmas with Bondfreak - Episode 21 The Bond series was in trouble when Pierce Brosnan was reportedly fired from the role. It was 4 long years before the next one. When i heard about the casting of Daniel Craig in the role of James Bond, i admit, like many, i was skeptical. Then before the movie these glowing reviews came in, so i had a bit more confidence in him. But nothing could have prepared me for this masterpiece. Martin Campbell returns and somehow manages to top his stellar Goldeneye. Casino Royale is a complete overhaul and a reinvention of the man that you only thought that you knew. It's quite possibly one of the best prequels of all time. Let's begin with Daniel Craig. He's blonde haired and blue eyed, not exactly our idea of Bond. But man does he deliver. He delivers this very wonderful, haunted and conflicted persona of Bond displaying amazing acting as well as the Bond-esque appeal. I couldn't believe my eyes when these tender scenes of emotion just pulled me right into the thick of things. Its definitely the best entrance into the Bond series, next to Sean Connery uttering ""Bond...James Bond"" in Dr. No of course. He gives us this background as to why Bond the way he is. Not only does he explain why, but we understand why, and that is the big key. A great performance indeed. Now for the girl. While the first girl Bond beds is a bit of a throwaway, the main girl is played incredibly well by Eva Green. While stunning to look at, she is moral, likable and very smart. Bond and her bare their souls for the camera and strip everything bare so that all we see between them is true human emotion and it is genuinely romantic. It is also tragic because you know that this is Bond, and she is just a girl. But their love story is so surprising and involving it was very saddening to watch the outcome of everything. The action is taken to new heights in Casino Royale. My favourite sequence is the free running sequence at the beginning of the movie. I'd say one of the best set pieces in recent years. I still cannot believe they did it all for real. The wall kick down elevator floors, the jumps from crane to crane, it was all real, i was left stunned. The airport chase is surprisingly good, i thought it was going to be just another exciting car chase, but its gritty, bruising and well edited. Then there's the poker game, which is actually exciting. Personally i love poker so i understood everything fine, but even if you didn't, Bond's friend Mathis explained everything for non poker players. *SPOILER* The chase for Vesper after she is taken is compelling and shocking when Bond skids to avoid her and flips his car. I felt both emotionally traumatized and sad that they had to ruin such a beautiful car. *END SPOILER*. The climatic scene following Vesper is probably the most emotional moment in the series. It's the perfect balance of tenderness and tragedy and its utterly heartbreaking. Daniel Craig's first outing simply blows me away on every level. The direction in inspired, the acting is beyond amazing and the action will leave your jaw on the floor. This movie caught me off guard and had me pinned to my seat in the theater. Craig is a dark and emotionally compromised Bond, and it could not have been played any better. The action is insane in the movie and those emotions run straight into your blood. Casino Royale in an unqualified triumph, show-stopping masterpiece and the best Bond film since Goldfinger. Thumbs WAY up!",positive
I nearly fell asleep during that poker scene. Rifftrax to the rescue!,negative
lots of action... Daniel Craig was fantastic...,positive
lots of action... a fave Daniel Craig was fantastic...,positive
"Best of the series since Goldeneye, possibly best one ever!",positive
Everyone thought Craig was going to be useless as the new Bond but this has dragged bond screaming and kicking into the 21st Century and does its best to catch up where the Bourne movies left off.Daniel Craig is great as Bond,positive

"One of the best bonds ever. A new, fresh start.....let`s get it on.",positive

"Everyone knows this is the best Bond movie in many, many years.",positive
I love bond movies but couldn't really stay interested with this one. He's a good bond and it's well made otherwise.,negative
"After watching this movie for the first time, I sat through the credits saying to myself that ""I have to watch it again"" and I saw it twice more the same night. Daniel Craig is the perfect Bond with charm, charisma, emotion and has passion. His posture and confidence is something I hadn't seen in the first 21 Bond movies. He cannot be compared to Mr. Connery but he has set the bar for future Bonds. Great way reboot a franchise. Martin Campbell delivers again in his second outing as the director and disposes of silly one liners, gadgets and makes the protagonist rely on instinct, feel and his mind since that is what an agent is suppose to do. Anyone can be shaped into an agent given cutting edge technology but this Bond is too humane and we see him progress as he fights with himself, feels the pain and learns from his mistakes. A must have for any REAL Bond fan.",positive
It's not as good as an old 'Dr.No' for example but I have to say that Craig did well. Nice one!,positive
i just like bond films <3,positive
"daniel craig is the only guy fit enough to carry the torch after sean connery, the rest were poseurs",negative
a good james bond movie,positive
"In Casino Royale, Daniel Craig takes over as James Bond after Pierce Brosnan, and he makes the character more sly and sophisticated. The story becomes more realistic and less overblown than Pierce Brosnan's run on the series, using less comical villains and situations. The movie makes use of parkour running, exotic locations, and a refined look by Daniel Craig as Agent 007. It replaces baccarat with poker and lessens the sexuality of Bond and crafts him into more of a ruthless and troubled character that defines the flawed heroes of the 21st century. Sure he can be stylish and mature at some points, but Bond will be Bond (martini shaken not stirred, Aston Martin, etc.). Intense fight sequences, a great theme song by Chris Cornell (of Audioslave and Soundgarden fame), and a well constructed movie makes this James Bond film one of the best ever.",positive
"I enjoyed this film up until the ending, which just got extremely muddled. Daniel Craig's Bond is a little more brutish than Connery, which may or may not work. You can definitely see the Bourne Identity influence in this film.",negative
"Un James Bond moderno, molto simile a Jason Bourne.",negative
"Way to knock the teeth out of what was turning into a campy, glittery, weak franchise. I don't think there is a better choice than Craig for the double 0 license.",negative
It didn't really feel like a bond movie without all the awesome gadgets and such. Craig did a great job though.,positive
Craig irrevocably claims the ground he staked in Casino Royale--he is THE James Bond.,positive
"Reboot de la franchise, CASINO ROYALE est une agreable surprise, malgre un DANIEL CRAIG clairement pas taille pour etre 007, tout en etant bon acteur au demeurant. Les seconds roles sont excellents et la mise en scene habile, en temoigne la scene d'ouverture, excellente. L'intrigue est bien menee, la partie de poker passionnante... CASINO ROYALE est un excellent cru, inattendu.",positive
"If you want to see the real James Bond go watch ""Dr.No"".",negative
"A great prequel to the legend of Bond; However, it simply cannot compare to the greatness of ""Die Another Day"", ""Octopussy"" or ""Live and Let Die"". It cannot be called a True Bond Movie, but it is an above-decent action film.",positive
I'm usually not a Bond fan but this was a great action film with a good story. It makes James Bond a badass.,positive
le meilleur des James Bond!,positive
daniel craig did his job!,negative
Daniel Craig it like sooo hot in this movie he makes such a gr8 bond he is my fav of them all so far!!,positive

"Excellent! So much action, I had to see it again to make sure I caught it all, and it was so worth it :)!",positive
"ONE OF THE MY BEST MOVIE AND u ARE ROCK DEAR KEEP ROCKING ME AWESOME WITH ME :) -- rockymeet -- <a href=""http://blogshubhinetwork.com"">seo jaipur</a>--seo jaipur",positive
"I enjoyed The director Martin Campbell fresh approach and vision, as well as Daniel Craigs interpretation of Bond. Action Packed.",positive
Favorite James Bond movie so far.,positive
James bond goes hard in this one but it's like he was trying to be jason bourne but still a good flick,positive
"Casino Royale sees Bond back to his best. Daniel Craig steps into the role of Bond perfectly, providing something different to the Bond character that Brosnan didn't. Eva Green is beautiful as Vesper Lynd and makes a very good Bond Girl, the chemistry between her and Bond is electrifying. The action sequences are breathtaking, especially the parkour chase in Madagascar. Add in the Bond humour, the gadgets and the pretty cars, this film really is one of the best Bond films ever.",positive
"Excellent bond film - Daniel Craig is superb - only let down by the sequel, Quantum of Solace, which could have been so much better.",positive
"Wake up and smell the 2000s, people. Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever!",positive
HOT!! very good OO7!! Better than the rest minus sean conery!! no one can top him!,positive
"As much as I worried about Daniel Craig's suitability as Bond before watching this movie, he only managed to help make this the best Bond movie ever made, in my opinion. A brilliant screenplay, that explains so much of the mystery that makes Bond who ho is, also didn't hurt, but Craig certainly brings something fantastic to the character of James Bond.",positive
"It looks like Martin Campbell needs to save the bond franchise every decade: ""Golden Eye"" was awesome, Casino Royale even more.",positive
The Best Action Movie Ever!!!!!!!,positive
"I got a big flashback in the movie... ""I forgot that you was you!""",negative
A very good first film in the Bond franchise for Daniel Craig.,positive
liked it but not loved it. one fresh tomato for daniel haha~~~,positive
"I enjoyed it thoroughly. There was some quite awesome action sequences, my personal favorite being the free running scene at the beginning. This is how Bond should be. Gritty and real. it works better for the character from the book. Bond is void of any emotions, being suave and persuasive while still being a cold hearted killing machine at the same time. I think Daniel Craig has played the character the best since Sean Connery.",positive
I'm not a James Bond fan. I really enjoyed this film.,positive
"Another movie that was good, after I ignored the fact that the book was better.",negative
Awesome. Definately the best Bond film so far.,positive
"More violence than I like in a movie, but it was very well done.",negative
This movie is perfection.,positive
"This was a good flick, but there can be only one Sean Connery when it comes to Bond; James Bond.",negative
hate the new james bond..,negative
Some of the best ninja-like action I've seen since Jackie Chan.,positive
"I'm a huge James Bond fan, and this was just too different for my taste.",negative
torture scene = superb!,negative
best bond movie EVER!!!!,positive
"The beggining of 007 character, n' Daniel Craig first movie. The action scenes are great! The fisrt chasing is breath-taking, but what Judi Dench is doing here???",negative
"Above all the many Bond films I love, many of which are from the Connery era, Casino Royale stands high and above as not only my personal favorite of the series but also as the most definitive 007 experience to date. And as a lifelong Bond fan, it easily cracks my top 5 favorite films. Gone are the over the top gadgets, the ultra cheesy one liners, and the uber campiness. This reboot of the series goes back to the origins of the character with an approach taken with 100% seriousness. Daniel Craig's Bond is meant to be seen as a real individual with flaws, heartbreaking emotion, and plenty of that 007 charm and cold killer mentality. Normally Bond girls are merely trophy women that tag along for the ride as James foils the plans of a diabolical mastermind, but Eva Green's performance as Vesper Lynd brings something to the table hardly witnessed in the twenty previous installments. Like Craig, she's a genuine individual not plagued by stereotypes. Her own humor and witty charm match Bond toe for toe, and their relationship makes for perhaps the strongest aspect of the film. As an extremely successful revitalization, Casino Royale moved the franchise in a much sorely needed direction with Daniel Craig leading the way. With a perfect balance of action and plot development, Bond has never been better. 10/10",positive
best bond movie ever,positive
"Casino Royale is one of the finest Bond movies in recent memory. It does everything right. Daniel Craig, who plays the iconic 007, gives an excellent performance, and hands-down, the best Bond aside from Sean Connery.",positive
Jotain Bondista on kadonnut näiden actionpläjäysten myötä. Sean = ainoa oikea.,negative
"Slam, bam, thank ya ma'am! I've seen all of the Bond flicks and there isn't one bum in the lot. Although I think this guy is the weakest link in the Bond actors sheme of things.",positive
"A good debute for Craig as the new 007. The movie has a different attitude than its predecessors, which can cause some discomfort among some of the fans of the series. But when all is said and done, the movie is worth watching.",negative
Very nice story and very matured.,positive
"there could have been a better leading lady for this 1, i just know it.",negative
Daniel Craig is the best looking 007,negative
"Very long, and towards the end I had no idea what was going on. Seemed to lack plot in some ways.",negative
WAY overrated!!! where is the real Bond??? When did Bond have feelings outside his pants?,negative
omg daniel craig is beyond sexy. the movie was so full of action to be so short. should have been longer!,positive
I thought it could've had more action,negative
I thought James Bond was supposed to be a handsome man?,negative
excellent movie it waz one dat kept u on ur toes and u jus could notwait to get to the ending and see wat the ending is that big surprise uknw wat im talkin bout!,positive
Daniel Craig on his best.If I may the greatest Bond character so far.It was directed amazingly and it kept the audience thrilled till the end,positive
daniel craig is mingin,negative
i fell asleep in the theater.,negative
Daniel Craig is the only actor to pull off a credible James Bond since Sean Connery.,positive
"Daniel Craig is a terrific Bond, and this film is almost just as good as the original films. It's a must-see for Action fans, Bond fans, and newcomers to Bond films alike. It recieves my highest recommendation.",positive
i like it but you get to see a new side of 007 and i was not sure about Daniel Craig being James,positive
The best bond film in years,positive
Love the new bond movies,positive
"A great movie that ties in well with it's direct sequel, and keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire ride. The acting is superb, and the story gripping.",positive
Only Bond movie I have watched,negative
"i liked this movie because I visited Casino Royale, its in Monte Carlo Monaco and its breathtaking. On another note, i think Daniel Craig is a pretty good James Bond but not as good as Connery. but soooo much better than Brosnan",negative
"Hmmmm, dodgy plot devices otherwise reasonable. Mar 2010 DVD",negative
OMG I love this movie!!!!!,positive
"Don't casr for Daniel Craig as Bond, story line boring",negative
Awesome opening sequence!,positive
im giving it an extra star because of mr craig in his swimming trunks corrrrrr,positive
best james bond no question,positive
best bond movie so far..,negative
I PREFER D OLD JAMES BOND,negative
not as good as quantum of solance of cource but it is one best bond films i have seen for a long time though bond dosent care who he kills really but he is even more reacles in the second one. This just proves that it can get better after sean connery though.,positive
Una de las mejores peliculas de Bond que he visto. Desde Dr. No que el Bond no era caracterizado por lo que es... un asesino de sangre fria. 1/2 estrella de menos por los ultimos minutos de amor meloso.,negative
"Ahhh, my favorite Bond film ever. Simply fantastic movie alla around. One of my favorite movies of the last 5 years.",positive
"Aha! Now I get it . . . kinda. I'll have to watch ""Quantum of Solace"" again. I love the foot chase at the beginning. Who needs a window when you can just bust through the wall?",positive
I don't do Bond films but this was ok,negative
daniel craig could be the best bond or if not the next best,positive
"probably the best Bond ever, with a real actor at the helm.",positive
By the far the best james bond film.,positive
"Campbell avait deja ressuciter James Bond avec Pierce Brosnan dans Goldeneye. Il recidive avec Daniel Craig dans Casino Royale. Deux films, deux chefs d'oeuvres.",positive
Beste Bond filmen EG har sedd...,positive
as a simple action movie i give it a 4 but a as a James bond movie...,negative
Daniel Craig is yum!,positive
Great. Pity bout the sequel,positive
I loved this one! Daniel Craig migh be my favorite Bond. But then maybe it's those sea blue eyes and kissable lips. ;-),positive
"First 20 minutes are GREAT!! Action, action, action",positive
"You want a new Bond movie with an awesome new Bond, a great plot and tons of fun, explosive action? Casino Royale is the answer to your prayers.",positive
"Pretty cool .. and guess what, another Bond movie ...",negative
"Probably the best James Bond movie ever made. Martin Campbell really succeeds in bringing Bond into today. This is all for realism and brings some humanity into the re-awakened hero. They don't skip out on the action either and in the mindset of Jason Bourne, Daniel Craig takes care badguy after badguy. Love this chapter of the bond era.",positive
great movie... one of my favorites,positive
"One of the best bond movies with one, if not THE best bonds!",positive
Very good reboot to the series in my opinion.,positive
Boring and confusing.... bleh.,negative
the new james bond sucks,negative
"Mm, mm, mm Daniel Craig. Yes, please.",positive
Five stars just for THAT scene!,positive
I love Daniel Craig as James Bond! I think he is one of the best yet!!,positive
One of the better James Bond movies of the last 5 years. Poker scene was great.,negative
The best bond movie.,positive
"When will we get a real actor as Bond again? You know- good looking, charming, looks good in the suit... can talk without sounding like a machine... the same thing lacking in the Batman franchise right now...",negative
Even though it's cheesy and way over branded and over acted. It's a good franchise and I was glad they brought it back in a way that wasn't x + y + z = world domination,negative
"Daniel Craig impressed me.....a lot. Not really the classic 007 type, but great nonetheless.",positive
very good movie and a lot of action. I would see it again and aagain.,positive
that was a really good show,positive
The best Bond movie ever. Takes him back to the Ian Flemming roots.,positive
wow. probably the best bond.,positive
"One of the better bond movies I have seen, enjoyed it, worth the time",positive
Typical Bond movie with all the action you could want BUT with an actual plot!,positive
there's a reason Craig's Bond has earned more money at the Box Office than any other in History...He's awesome at playing the role. Eva Green shines as well.,positive
"im not going to say im versed in the bond films, before seeing this film i had only seen the bronson films and they were gonna help give me a low expectations on this one. i go in there and see mr. bond do all sorts of crazy mad hattery. i was left in awe when i left the theater, bond was pure bad assery. the story was genius, the characters were well written and played. yes the camera work was shaky, but they wanted it to feel more like you were there ala the bourne films. i cant find a single flaw in this film other than it ended, best bond film imo",positive
James bond just rocks all the way around,positive
"I think Craig is one of the best after Connery, great movie!!",positive
"LOVED it. Never had any desire t see a James Bond movie until Daniel Craig came along. Not exactly sure what the movie was about, but I don't care... Mr. Craig was so stunning to watch it doesn't matter. :-)",positive
"This James bond film is so good you'll go crazy! Everything here is on the next level! the director is doing the best job ever, the cast is awesome and flawless! The story is perfectly unfolding before our eyes building up the tension & the complete ensemble is just incredibly good! A total five stars entertainment. This time they really brought back the Bond experience!",positive
the BEST bond since connery,positive
the BEST bond since connery,positive
This is possibly one of the best 007 movies from Daniel Craig. I'm a huge fan of Poker and I loved watching this movie.,positive
"Good start for Daniel Craig. This one is actually worthwhile, Quantum sucked big time. I prefer Brosnan!",negative
Highly entertaining and action packed. I plan to see Quantum of Solace right away because this movie had me hooked until the very end!,positive
"Best Bond film, yah, I said it. Even though Golden Gun is some good laughs - 3 nipples, C'mon!",positive
this james bond isnt even hott bummer,negative
"This is the best movie reboot I've ever seen. Daniel Craig doesn't look like James Bond, but he plays the part extremely well. Even though the film included many more action sequences that weren't in the original novel, the movie still follows the original Ian Flemming book very closely. The film never gets boring and consistently gives us great characters, dialogue, and action. I saw this film in theaters twice. Its definitely worth watching.",positive
One part of theis movie james bond asks the guy to itch his balls,positive
not bad but its not worth watchin twice,negative
bond is reborn. this movie brought the franchise back to classic bond,positive
"With a strong performance from Daniel Craig and sharp direction, Casino Royale ranks among one of the best films of the year, action-packed and accompanied with a great and agile script.",positive
A volta triunfal com um improvável James Bond! Adorei!,positive
not a big james bond fan,negative
"One of the better Bond flicks in the present day era, stayed within itself and kept the true bond essence!",positive
Double-O's are always special...,negative
"Craig is not Connery, but the movie was good.",negative
"I didn't really like the look of Daniel Craig as Bond before I saw this movie, but I'm definitely a fan now. Great action scenes!",positive
First half is good - second half not so much. Really drags about 3/4 through.,negative
Only James Bond worth watching.,positive
"Never was a big fan of 007 (aside from the games)...that is, until this flick dropped. The Blonde Bond put it down in this thriller, as Daniel Craig delivers a grittier, more believable portrayal of the special agent (maybe the best? Don't kill me, Sean). Cold and remorseless, yet cool and charismatic, just as James Bond is supposed to be. The whole movie is sharp, scenic, and packed to the brim with some visceral action sequences. Yet while the sequel ups that ante, I prefer this more because of the extra emotional edge it carries. There's much more insight in the relationship between M (Dame Judi Dench) and Bond. And plus c'mon: actually FALLING for a Bond girl?! That alone should have your interest, but the tale of Vesper Lynd is actually quite sad.",positive
Bond DOESN'T CRY!!! WTF!!!!!!!!!,negative
good but the old ones were better,negative
Casino royale is a great movie but it just doesnt feel like a bond movie at all.,negative
The 1st James Bond movie I've EVER liked!,negative
"Liked it a lot! Daniel Craig is great as begginner Bond, and the movie actually has a realism in it finally!",positive
Thoroughly impressive.,positive
I LOVE DANIEL CRAIG!!,positive
James Bond is way 2 emational in this - hes suppossed 2 b heartless,negative
"just another film ruined, thank you Daniel Craig, asshole!",negative
"This is a great movie that takes unexpected turns and heats up the intensity pretty high. This film will take you to exotic locations beat the shit out of you and leave you for dead. Daniel Craig is a perfect don't-fuck-around Bond. An excellent debut to start with. One of my favorite Bond movies ever, if you're a Bond fan you should have seen it already.",positive
"good bond movie, craig is good",negative
"I have never been a fan of James Bond and i thought i never would be...that is until i saw this film. James Bond Casino Royale is a reboot of the series, and it is about a government agent who is saving the day as his job, and one day finishes a mission thought impossible and gets promoted to status ""00"". After that its all about his spylife and the many dangerous life risking events that he goes through. From meeting his partner who he madly falls in love and finding out something about her he'll never forget, to being stripped nude and being hit on the balls with a huge rope by his enemies. Casinos Royale has it all, style,originality,action,comedy,and a touch of drama making it the best bond film i have ever seen.",positive
"Best ""Bond"" movie ever. In my humble opinion.",positive
Daniel Craig is the best James bond since Sean gave up his crown.,positive
"I was worried about Daniel Craig as the only thing i saw him in previous was the dire Layer Cake, but i should not have worried as this & him as Bond is the best in the series. The only problem with it as usual is David Arnold who seems incapable as ever of knowing how to score a Bond. Shame that the follow up was a shambles. Eva Green is great",positive
Well... it was better than Quantum! But a good Bond movie? NO,negative
I am not a fan of Bond Movies. So this I don't like that much.,negative
The best bond movie thus far where story takes the front seat which is supported well by great action sequences.,positive
Mindless action movie - aren't they the greatest? I must say I like Daniel Craig as Bond!,positive
"My dad forced me to watch this movie. He loves Bond...I hate Bond. He knew that full well when he convinced me to watch it with him. And you know what? Casino Royale is now the only James Bond movie I've ever liked. Now my reasons for hating Bond is this; how can a character who is featured in 20 movies, have zero evolution? Sean Connery as 007 is one of the iconic movie characters of the 1960s. But when the only thing about a character that changes over the next 40 years is the actor who plays him, why bother making so many movies? Yeah Ian Fleming wrote a lot of books, but do you have to adapt them all? Anyway, onto the movie itself. Casino Royale is chronologically the first story in the James Bond series. It shows 007 trying to stop a man who financially backs terrorist organization by beating him in a high stakes poker tournament in Montenegro. Daniel Craig plays James Bond and although he doesn't look like Connery, Pierce Brosnon, Roger Moore or Timothy Dalton, he kicks ass. But he kicks ass in a realistic way. For one, Craig is in incredible shape for the role. But it's the little things that happen to him that never happened to his predassessors. Namely when he gets punched in the face, he gets cut or bleeds. When he rolls on the ground, his clothes get dirty. That never happened to Bond before so that made it more realsitic for me. That works for the ""swinging sixites"", but not so much in 2006. In closing, if you love Bond you'll probably like this film. If you were like me and hate Bond, give this movie a shot. It was worth seeing.",negative
"This is a bit of a Marmite film, most people either love the fact it's very different from the older Bond films or think it's ruined the whole point.",positive
Bond at his absolute best.,positive
somehow i prefer a kick-ass bond to the suave type of connery and brosnan,positive
NOW I can watch Bond and thoroughly enjoy it!,positive
Very good. The balcony fight scene was easily in my top 25 favorite fight scenes of all time.,negative
"Lots of Action. Really cool, Awsome and much much more. This movie is packed with action.",positive
The card game was way to long.,negative
best bond moive i've seen in years,positive
"Me gustó, conste que cuando eso no sabía jugar póker.. imaginate el sentido que va a tener ahora que ya sé! :)",positive
The new Bond. Very very badass! Both films are fantastic. Can't wait for another one. Daniel Craig is the best bond yet.,positive
"What a great action flick, but I don't care much for the new Bond. He shakes me, but I don't find him very stirring.",positive
Best Bond Film in a long time!,positive
"A hell of a lot better than i thought it was going to be. The opening sequence in black and white is beautiful, and the lack of ridiculous gadgets makes it feel like a true spy film, as opposed to the bilge that Brosnan did.",positive
I really like him as Bond,positive
"Watch like 3 times and finally finished it. Besides the Hold'em, can't really remember much about the movie.",negative
I would have loved this if it wasn't supposed to be a Bond flick.,negative
daniel had it tough following previous bonds but he made him his own character and played one of the best bonds to date very good film,positive
This is the best James Bond movie ever.Daniel Craig is the perfect 007. A must see.Bond movies in a state of art.Mads Mikkelsen is just perfect as Le Chiffre.,positive
"This is how bond should be. This is realistic as you can be without being boring. This is a good blend of the old bond without all the over built up drama and ego that came with the later years. This bond is vulnerable and imperfect accept when it comes to his unmatched skills to kick peoples butts. The only thing I fear it is missing is some of the old bond humor, both this and Quantum of Solace don't have an appearance by Q, or R or some version of them. No nifty toy room with people being lit on fire by ham sandwiches. Oh well seeing as that is my only complaint I loved it.",positive
A fine reboot to the James bond franchise.,positive
"In a word: Overrated. In a few more: it's not bad. Really, honestly. My initial review gave it 3.5 stars. It's just that it keeps losing half a star every time I see it, so for both our sakes I think I'll stop now. Good ideas, but this Jason Bourne wannabe is thoroughly heartbreaking. Of all the lame half-assed action franchises to be stealing from (ok, as far as lame half-assed action franchises go, Jason Bourne is probably the fillet, but that's beside the point). I get irked when people say ""This is the way Ian Flemming wrote Bond's in the books!"" First off, I've read some of the books and they suck ass with the ferocious suction of a vacuum-powered lifer at Jessup County. But that's beside the point (and also ridiculously harsh) - Bond wouldn't have lasted 40years in that mode (see J.J. Abrams' 'Star Trek' for parallels). The Bond franchise is a movie franchise, independent of the books; they're trashing film history to stay faithful to... drivel. There, I said it. As I said - not bad (or horrible, anyway). But its incessant desire to be serious makes it laughable and groan-worthy. Craig looks like he'd rather be starring in a bar brawl than wearing monkey suits, driving fancy cars and bedding fancier broads. If you want to see Bond get serious and STILL BE BOND, save yourself the bloody misery and check out the infinitely superior, more exciting and far more intelligent (really - it's like comparing 'CSI' to 'The Wire', or 'Troy' to 'Lawrence Of Arabia) LICENCE TO KILL. 'Nuff said.",negative
Probably the best bond film to date!,positive
Probably the best bond film to date!,positive
Daniel Craig is a stud. This movie is so good and I can't even remember why. Awesome Awesome Awesome.,positive
one of my fav bond..,positive
"Mads Mikklesen worst film, still good though.",negative
I think Daniel Craig is the best Bond yet. This movie was over the top and amazing.,positive
"Personally, one of the best Bond films in a long time. Props to EON for picking a superb choice that of Daniel Craig. Craig makes you feel that Bond is a real person and you understand where he is coming from. Craig shows he is up to the challenge of taking on the role of 007; to which he passed with flying colors. Judi Dench as M makes the mode set well. Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelson) makes a great baddie. Eva Green as Bond's true love Vesper is a terrific hit, full of beauty and romance and tragedy. This movie will become a classic in the 007 series in no time. It just might rival Goldfinger as the best one in the series? Craig proves that he IS Bond and let us hope he sticks around for a few more outing! A terrific movie for all 007 fans",positive
Craig is the best Bond. Period.,positive
"OMG! Daniel Craig as the new James Bond I love it! He's just dishy as hell. Oh, and the movie was excellant, too!",positive
"not bad for Daniel Craig's first attempt as bond, at least you can see he gets hurt unlike the other bonds.",negative
The Classic is better.,negative
"Very good first movie for Daniel Craig's bond. However, there were no car chases and no gadgets. What's up with that?",negative
"EstÃ¡n de moda los reboot de las franquicias,este es bastante acertado,quitandole algunos clichÃ (C)s al personaje (lo que puede ser una jugada bastante arriesgada para lo fans de antaÃ±o) y poniendole mÃ¡s crudeza y realismo al personaje. Muy muy acertado.",negative
"The best so far of the ""Bonds"" with Daniel Craig as 007.",negative
"I watched it, but I didn't understand it at all when the credit rolled",negative
Better than Sean Connery's character for James Bond.,positive
New Bond Franchise. I didn't expect to like this Bond as I am a Pierce Brosnan fan but Daniel Craig is great. This is a grittier dirtier Bond which blends well with the new look of the genre.,positive
i loveeee the james bond movies.,positive
"Real in your face action scenes. Thought it was pretty good, was never a big fan of Pierce Brosnan as 007, but I thought Daniel Craig really pulled it off. Good movie, worth watching.",negative
im glad to see they finally released the first one and originally this was supposed to be the first one good vibe and i liked how they introduce another bond like the 6th one,positive
very good action scenes,positive
"Easily the best and most sophisticated in the franchise, though a bit overlong.",positive
"The best Bond yet - tough and gritty. Loved the action scenes (driving, running, fighting). The pace of the movie was also excellent, although I found the actual card game a bit long, and the movie ended a bit flatly with the Vesper/Mr White angle. Nonetheless, Casino Royale rocks.",positive
"it was alright. great action, but too much talking and drama.",positive
"This top-notch spy thriller not only is a great movie, it is a perfect James Bond movie. The one and only way to improve on this that I could see was to make it rated R and even grittier. I have seen ever James Bond film many times, and I am not afraid to say this is undoubtedly the best. Yes, it is better than ""Goldfinger"", ""Dr. No"", ""From Russia With Love"", or any Sean Connery movie which people blindly claim as the only good James Bond films. And as for Daniel Craig, he is definetly the best Bond yet. His brutality and self-centeredness is far closer to anyone I can imagine that kills people for a living. Which is what he essentially what he does and always has done. Not that that is a bad thing. The emotions in this film are far more naked and intense than any James Bond film or most spy films. This is barely rated PG-13, and is one of the most mature films I have ever seen with such a rating. I am not talking about maturity in the sense of voilence or sexual situations, but the depth and reality of the characters. My point is that most films that have great, compelling characters are rated R or above, simply because R rated movies have more room to grow without restrictions. Yet this film rides the line perfectly and would most likely have surely recieved an R rating 30 years ago. But that is not what makes this film great, what makes this film great is the willingness of the creators to go in a completely new direction with this franchise and defy virtually all fans wishes. They cast a blonde haired Bond, and people rioted. For God's sake the man is brilliant. No ""Q"" character, none of his gadgets, no bimbos as Bond girls, no cartoonish villians that are bent on ruling the world. Just a brutal villian who simply wants to win back money to save his life. No goofball sidekicks that have metal teeth or razor-brimmed hats. Just realistic people in quite realistic, dangerous situations. The desicion to go back to the beginning of Bond's career was ingenious. And with only Judi Dench as the tie to the earlier films. Casting Jeffery Wright as Felix Leiter was also brilliant, bringing an new rendition to an old face of the franchise. The spectacular black-and-white assassination sequence at the opening and a for once not boring as hell music-themed opening credits start the beginning of a superb film. Fans of Bond and good film should definetly enjoy this picture.",positive
Daniel Craig kicks the other Bonds' ass.,positive
"A great restart. Bond had become a parody of itself, and Daniel Craig did a great job with the role.",positive
One line review: To me the James Bond Series ended when Brosnan left and this guy just doesn't cut it.,negative
Daniel and Eva 's conversation on the train was so intense and very well thought of. The one thing i like about this movie is the never ending action.,positive
Estupendo debut de Daniel Craig como James Bond. No se la pierdan.,positive
What did they do to James Bond!!!! The Daniel Craig series are as bad as the Timothy Dalton series. TOTAL CRAP!!!!,negative
Not as good as the old classics !,negative
"So this is my very first Bond movie, and it quickly prompted me to Netflix all the others. I can't wait to see Goldfinger in 2011. Anyway, from a guy who has a general distaste for Hollywood blockbusters, THIS is how you do it. From my understanding, this seems to be a total reboot of the franchise, ala Batman Begins. And what a reboot it is! Daniel Craig fits the Bond role perfectly: suave, tough, sophisticated, insanely sexy motherfucker. Supporting cast is very good too, especially Eva Green. The plot revolves around a high stakes poker game and I appreciated the director Martin Campbell giving lots of its near 3-hour running time building drama and tension around a card table. The action scenes are also superbly shot and are phenomenal. Campbell gives the scenes lots of expansive space and scope compared to the typically incomprehensible, cramped cinematography of movies like this. They're refreshingly memorable and watchable. One of the best big-budget films of the decade. Definitely see it.",positive
"Never got into the old James Bond films; I really enjoyed this one, Daniel Craig makes a great Bond!",positive
Come on Daniel Craig.... ;-),positive
"Once I understood how the James Bond series came about this movie seemed have more cred. It's more realistic (I used that word loosely) than previous James Bonds, but it gives a different aspect to the persona",negative
good like all james bond except i prefer pierce brosnan,positive
"Following the trend of rebooting action movie franchises into a darker tone (started by Batman Begins [2005]), the Bond franchise starts over again, removing all of the things that make you're typical run-of-the-mill Bond movie, such as gadgets, Q, Monnypenny, the gunbarrel scene, the ""Bond theme"", Bond's finness, Bond's sense of humor, Bond's womanizing, nudity in the main titles, and speed. One tends to fall asleep within the second hour of the film, (see running time) which all takes place in the titular Casino. In retrospect, the changes that were made to the franchise at this point were neccisarry, since there's only so many times one can tolerate the same story formula. I never had a problem with Bond being",negative
"One of the best Bond film. Daniel Craig isn't the best Bond, but he still gets the job done.",positive
"Even if it was my first bond movie, I thought it was impressive. Daniel Craig was awesome in this film. Great effects, intense plot, and an amazing cast makes Casino Royale, an awesome action film.",positive
daniel craig coming out of the water in a speedo..... thats all i have to say.,positive
James bond...classic!,positive
superb. Bond is back to his best. Daniel Craig makes a great Bond. One of the best bond films ever.,positive
Fantastic Bond movie. Better than any of the Pierce Brosnan movies with the possible exception of Goldeneye.,positive
Daniel Craig did a great job with this remake...,positive
LOVE IT!! Daniel Craig is so HOTT!!,positive
Montenegro part is ridiculous,negative
its awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
my favorite bond movie. daniel craig in his first bond role was excellent.,positive
"A terrific and jarringly different Bond for a new generation. The explosive, naked violence of it left audiences both shaken and stirred.",negative
Definitely best bond ever!,positive
"It was kind of amazing. Daniel Craig is a great Bond, but not as good as Sean Connery. Still, great.",positive
"fun, kick arse, complicated but easy to follow. not as ""apart"" from the james bond series as people like to think, it's got more vicious fighting and more realistic yet still exhillirating stunts - but lots of wisecracks.",negative
Daniel Craig is perfect fit for the role. Quite contrary what I thought he would be.,negative
One of the best bond movies,positive
"Considering how crappy Pierce Brosnan's Bond films were, aside from GoldenEye, I was impressed at how good Casino Royale was. I am impressed by how good of an actor Daniel Craig is, and I think he does a really good job as the new face of Bond franchise. I have not yet seen the newest installment, I hope it does not follow the same path the later Brosnan movies took, I hope it stays away from all those pointless puns.",negative
O JB não agora não é mais o mesmo. Deu até sono assistindo o filme. Totalmente diferente o personagem.,negative
Vesper Lynd: It doesn't bother you? Killing all those people? James Bond: Well I wouldn't be very good at my job if it did.,positive
give me more stars to spend on the best bond movie ever and maybe the best movie of that year,positive
The real James Bond is back. One of only three 007 movies that get absolutely everything right. Craig is outstanding. Scene on the train with Eva Green is a standout.,positive
This was my first bond movie I saw lol.. So it was good but then when I saw Quantum of solace casino royal was nth!!,negative
I love the James Bond movie but i think the first James Bond was the best,positive
Daniel Craig what more can I say.,positive
The Best Bond movie ever. Period.,positive
The. Best. Bond. Ever.,positive
im pretty sure I saw this one with my daddy... lol.,negative
"Secret Agent Man Chasing, Fighting, Dressing up Wait! Who's the bad guy?",positive
"Best new reinvention of Bond. Or I guess, it's nice that they're finally following the books.",positive
Liker nok Mr. Brosnan best i James Bond. Eller for all del de gode gamle med Sean Connery.,negative
"Wow! I loved the Sean Connery movies and since then they seem to have deteriorated. This film is definite proof that the Bond series is not lost. A different type of Bond, played by Daniel Craig, was what the franchise needed and the storyline was intriguing throughout the film. Even the one-liners and old Bond jokes which made the original films to entertaining and memorable are present in this film, much to my delight. You can't miss this film if you're a James Bond fan, and even if you're not, you'll still love it anyway.",positive
Excellent Bond update,positive
Great... Daniel Craig at his best.,positive
Now THIS IS WOT JAMES BOND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE!,positive
"If not for some of the old Bond prejudice, this would have been a perfect movie. Still ranks as one of the best Bonds. Bad ass lead? Check. Hot Bond-girl? Check. Crazy terrorist backed by mysterious international organization? Check. Five stars? Check.",positive
The BEST Bond Movie ever. Daniel Craig Took the ass whippin like a man.,positive
"it was ok, but the worst james bond movie ever, and there towards the end you think someone accidentally put a soft porn flick on instead...wtf",negative
"Bond does the Bourne thing. And he's damn good at it. Who could have known, eh?",positive
James bond is always a pimp. But this movie was lacking his cool gadgets and his classy attitude. But he did show the bad aas side of him. Nevertheless james bond rarley gets less then a 3.5 for me,positive
"An awesome Bond movie. Daniel Craig is a badass Bond (I mean he will rip your head off), Eva Green is a great Bond girl shes feisty and sexy. Everything is is great about this film.",positive
This was one of the better 007 movies.,positive
"Interesting, but slightly boorish new take on 007. The smarmy Brosnan formula had been utterly played out. This is more 'realistic', but less imaginative and colorful as the old Bonds.",negative
"kinda sucks all they do is gamble, then in the last minutes of the movie the action begins",negative
"Finally a Bond flick made for women, but with all the great action one comes to expect from Bond.",positive
The way bond was meant to be...,positive
"My score dropped slightly on this rewatch. It's possible my frame of reference for quality has changed since the last time I've watched it. It's still a really strong movie, but there are some elements where it didn't quite feel as mind blowing as previous viewings. I really like Eva Green in this role, and she mixes well with Craig, who is definitely my favorite Bond.",positive
"A much-needed reivention to the James Bond films, Casino Royale is quite like a hybrid of the Bourne films and the Bond films. The style of Casino Royale is like the Bourne films, but the fun implausibility of some moments in the film show that it is just as much a Bond film as any other Bond film before it. The result - a great film which goes back to the beginning to tell the story of how James Bond first got his licence to kill (yes, it's actually a prequel). The surprisingly high level of violence (including a slightly nasty torture scene) helps too. A little long, but still really good.",positive
Probably the better film of Daniel Craig as James Bond,positive
"Hands down, one of the best Bond films to date. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery - and the story, cinematography and stunts are all fantastic.",positive
Improves every time I watch it. I am now settled with Craig as Bond. No longer a joke series.,positive
"best bond film to date. casino royale hit the spot on first strike. action scene is given to all bond movies but the emotion of bond captures my attention, is this the turning point of james bond being a cold hearted agent? poker action then live hitting action when james leave the table. love it. i love eva green",positive
Good opening for Daniel. The intensity of the movie is gripping and kind of suits the new young bond.,positive
"a good debut, Craig is the next Bond",positive
"Daniel Craig is growing on me for Bond, I'll really like this eventually This one feels way more violent then past Bond Films, and I have almost all on DVD from Dr. No to Die another Day",negative
"Excellent 007 film. It blew me away. Craig is an excellent Bond, and the spy/thriller action is undeniably edge-of-your-seat. Professional Poker has a large role in this film, so knowing the game before you watch is a plus!",positive
Daniel Craig is so HOTT!,negative
"not so bad , no one can jump to rooftops thats for sure , but this movie is ok",negative
"Though not as good as the originals, it gives a new and much more realistic look at the Bond movies.",positive
whilst i feel pierce brosnan is the best bond i certainly think the franchise needed a reboot and it got that in abundance. daniel craig is brilliant as bond as he recieves his 00 status for the first time and goes wild by shooting up embassies and destroying buildings to get his man le chiffre played brilliantly by mads mikkelsen....one of the best bond films to date,positive
Nice! Love Daniel Craig as Bond =),negative
GREAT! I loved the choice of kind of an unknown in James Bond's shoes a perfect fit though! Great Bond!,positive
really boring. I thought James Bond actually fought it out instead of pokering it out for the whole movie,negative
i prefer this guy to pierce(he was a tool),positive
the best bond since connery,positive
"Pretty exciting. Finally, a movie based on Texas Holdem which is interesting to watch.",negative
"Pow, it really packs it all.",positive
The film that made me fall in love wirth bond again!,positive
"Magnificent. Being a avid Ian Fleming fanatic since childhood, I thought this was the first Bond film that was actually true to the book. Cheers, Daniel Craig!",positive
"Accion accion y mas accion, super movie chingona, lo traicionan bien culero al pobre compa, pero ps es perron el weey!! Pelicula con clase!!",positive
very good remake! Daniel Craig fit this role perfectly!!,positive

"Best Bond since ""License to Kill"" - and that's saying something!",positive
"I liked the movie, but it was way too long and alot of parts dragged on. The action scenes are awesome, but there wasn't enough of them. The ending was also meh.",positive
"This is the best bond in the recent years. People are still brown nosing the Brosnan films but CR is action-packed, intelligent, funny and the bond we want to see in the post-Bourne era. 10/10 to Daniel Craig who brings a intensity and human quality to a character that was drowning in his culture ego.",positive
Craig is probably the best James Bond since Sean Connery! Probably saved the franchise! Suck on that Brosnan!!!,positive
"I'm so sick of ""reboots"" this isn't a Bond film, it's a Bourne film that happens to feature Bond as the main character Bond should never be played by an actor under 40, and especially not by a blonde Clive Owen was the better choice Quentin Tarantino was the original director, but was fired when he demanded that Brosnan be allowed to stay on as Bond",negative
I love James Bond!! This movie was excellent!!,positive
Awesome movie. Takes the Bond series in a totally new dirtection that's a million times better than that Pierce Brosnan rubbish. Not truly a Bond film though in the classical sense,positive
Seems like one of the older bond movies but somehow in the present really good,positive
I dont like Daniel Craig as james bond he doesnt seem the type for the character,negative
Fantastic reboot of the series....,positive
"The definitive Bond film. No shadow of a doubt. Whilst Daniel Craig doesn't quite bear the resemblance of our traditional 007, he carries the suave and roguish performance better than any Bond before him. Martin Campbell has made a masterpiece here, reinvigorating the franchise it to some new and very exciting ground.",positive
Love Bond and despite my scepticism before watching I loved this.,positive
"Daniel Craig is a hit as James Bond! I look forward to many more ""Bond adventures"" with him.",positive
I don't think this was as good as previous Bond movies to be honest and I just can't get my head around Daniel Craig being Bond - I don't think he suits the role at all,negative
not mr b.'s best day at the office,negative
The best bond ever. This stayed true to what I have read of the books for the story of Bond. Great reinvention!,positive
I great reboot to Bond.,negative
VERY disappointing. Daniel Craig isn't the problem it is the writers.,negative
Brand spankin' new Bond.,positive
"James Bond 007, just fricken' amazing.",negative
"Great debut for Daniel Craig as Bond. He has some big shoes to fill, but fortunately he got one of the most well written Bond movies that I can remember... very good.",positive
Best Bond movie ever.,positive
ESTE 007 NO ME GUSTA,negative
"It takes a new approach, one that's gritty and realistic. But one could argue that that completely takes the tradition of Bond films away. Daniel Craig is my least favorite Bond since George Lazenby.",negative
"Great, gritty, and loaded with awesome stunts and explosions to keep this bond on his toes with the audience.",negative
"This is the first Bond movie I have seen. Before I watched this film, I checked the ratings of the critics who praised this film. Then, I asked my friends. They said this was the best Bond movie. So I decided to watch it. Casino Royale has impressive action sequences which not only deliver a thrill among the audience but are extremely unpredictable. Daniel Craig has given an amazing performance and so has Eva Green. However, what makes this film a little dissappointing is for three reasons. First, there is an improper antagonist. Is it LeChiffre or Mr. White? Or is it Vesper? Second reason why I was dissappointed is that the film is over complex. Im not talking about the normal plot but the idea of the poker game. Not everyone knows the rules of this game. It is confusing. Third reason is the dialogue. Im not saying this film has weak dialogue but the dialogue is so strong and it occurs so commonly throughout the film. I mean if you imagine in real life, dialogues aren't spoken every time. Other than that, this film has everything what a strong action spy film needs. You can see this movie for entertainment.",positive
"I read most of the Bond books back in the 70's with the duo colored covers in paperback. While this Bond does take you back to the genesis of Flemming's Bond, that was a Bond for the 50's. This movie lacked the world-wide crisis that many of the movie Bond's gave us. In this movie we have as a world crisis; a stock-option plan and a poker game. While authentic ( ie a president from Texas and a war in the middle-east), for a movie about escapism I dont want realism. Yes the movie does make Bond seem more human in that he gets tortured, as he does in the books and to an extent nothing like what we have seen since Dr. No, and an homage to an 80's film with Charles Bronson "" The Evil that Men Do"" with the whole naked guy in a chair and his testicles the object of torture has this felt more uncomfortable. Story: Lame, it is a money laundering scheme with a villain that we want to know why he has the scar in his eye. No sense of world doom. Acting: Tense, everyone is on edge. To make up for the fact that the only real crisis is money changing hands. Like we dont know that is going on already. Direction: Many fine action sequences. Why in the world would someone who can climb a constructed high-rise and a crane and than jump down not be someone ""they"" should know? Visuals: Eva Green in a nice evening-gown is a worthy visual. Overall: A more authentic Bond that lacked the panache for a movie. I felt very disappointed that Bond did not kill Le Chiffre, a major let down. Much like with Star Wars episodes I - III it is very hard to go back over previous subjects with updated technology without thinking how dated the previous movies looked and then thinking why didn't they have this when they first made the movie. It kind of ruins both of the movies.",negative
"The movie that made me want to go back and watch the other Bond films. It is one of the best bond movies, if not the best. This is if you can hold your feelings about Sean Connery apart from the quality of the film.",negative
I love Bond as a grittier harsher man. Daniel Craig is by far the best Bond - so much depth.,positive
every time we play this movie @ home it always gets stuck in the dvd player!!!!!!! Still a good movie though =),positive
My favorite James Bond movie,positive
By far the only Bond movie I actually like. And thats saying a lot..,positive
craig is so hot and nail it and this movie is good because you must watch it more than once to understand it and the end is the blast,positive
"loved it, more than any other 007",positive
Bonds back! And this time...he sinks venice!,positive
"I suppose being a massive James Bond hater, this one was bearable",negative
Dragged out ALOT!!!!!!!!!,negative
this movie is fresh!!!!,positive
Have not bought into Daniel Craig as Bond yet,negative
"Very good movie. This is the first James Bond movie to make it to my favorite list since ""Die another Day.""",positive
Daniel Craig best bond ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
Brought the whole 007 franchise back in with style. Daniel Craig is the unlikely savior that 007 has badly needed. Bravo!,negative
great movie lots of action. i love the fight scene in africa or wherever at the start,positive
Good movie... but sadly no epic james bond care chase scenes and lacking in kool gadgets.. yet Awsome free running!,negative
"Daniel Craig makes a deadly, calm and cool James Bond",positive
worst bond I've seen yet,negative
"itz bond,james bond classic,timeless classic",positive
One of the better Bond flicks.,negative
A gritty throwback to the classic Bond of the 1960s and a refreshing entry into the series after a decade of sub-par Bond adventures.,positive
THE BEST BOND FILM EVER!!!!!!!!,positive
Overrated. Bond would never say he doesn't care if his martini is shaken or stirred!,negative
A blond bond?.... He pulled it out off the bag.,negative
"Best bond movie yet Daniel Craig is perfect for the part, shows the dirty part of the work and doesn't gloss over it like the classic bonds",positive
can't say no 2 a good looking guy,positive
Love it! Although Quantum of Solice edged it a bit.,negative
"After watching a second time, thought it was a great movie =)",positive
"I'm going to swim against the tide on this one. Dull and lifeless after the opening scenes, it did absolutely nothing for me but solidify my belief that Bond is one of the least-deserving characterst to get a twenty-two film series devoted to him. If you like Bond, you'll love this. Otherwise, use the two-and-a-half hours to do something constructive, like, say, eat cheerios and watch VH1.",negative
Daniel Craig playing Bond as he was meant to be played. Not to mention those blue eyes...,positive
OMG! Hard to believe but I loved it! I even bought it! Plus star!,positive
"This fresh look at the bond series proves a huge success. From the first exciting chase to the potentially (but not) boring poker scenes, this movie is Bond as you've never seen him before, back and bigger than ever! Daniel Craig plays Bond very differently to his predecessors but I believe just as successfully, filling the boots of even Roger Moore with ease. One to watch.",positive
"Me parece de lo mejor que he visto sobre James Bond,no esperaba menos en lo que se refiere al actorazo que es este seÃ±or,que cada vez que le veo me recuerda al gran Steve McQueen,es serio,eficaz,elegante y parco en sentimientos pero notas cuando algo le afecta..",positive
Daniel craig mejor bond,positive
"Sorry, but the only 007 is Sean Connery. Craig is ok...but not suitable to portray James Bond.",negative
Daniel Craig is the new bond.,positive
Best James Bond Movie hands down!,positive
Extreme action....great movie,positive
"It's too damn long, it doesn't hold my attention after the first hour, it is a good movie though...especially the ending.",negative
"The First Daniel Craig bond is a break through. Not a lot of gadgets, no more cranky punch-lines, and more blood and hand to hand fighting. It's James Bond turned Jason Bourne. Oh wait... both of them have J.B. Initials!",positive
"Casino Royale was a huge (may I stress HUGE... and ad ""finally"" between ""was"" and ""a"") step in the right direction for the James Bond series. I'm not a regular fan of the series, a couple of my friends are, but I just don't see what they see in the older Bond films, and the newer films (up to the incredibly silly Die Another Day) were just too far-fetched and overly serious with cheesy one liners that made you embarrassed to be sitting in the theater to ever be considered remotely good. So when those same friends convinced me to go with them to see Casino Royale I was amazed to find that I was actually enjoying myself. Not only that, but by the end of the film I was also convinced that this was a really good movie graced with a great plot, and excellent characters which were accompanied by great acting. The fact that this film also happened to be a James Bond film only added to my amazement and sweetened up my previous distaste for the series! It was refreshing to see Bond without all the over-hyped and over-rated gadgets and instead to actually use his hands to bring the bad guys down classical style for once. The elaborate chase scene at the beginning is the perfect example of this. And do I even need to go into detail about that fantastic poker game where bond gets poisoned? Well I guess I already did... I love it when something so ordinary as a poker tournament can serve as such a gripping plot device! The humanization of the main characters was also a stellar improvement over the other films. This is the first Bond film where I actually found myself caring about Bond (you know the main character who you're supposed to be caring for and not just because he's trying to stop some evil genius from activating a doom laser) for reasons other than that the antagonist is being played by a worse actor than he was. The supporting characters were also surprisingly well fleshed out too, with him showing some genuine feeling and honesty towards his love interest. A refreshing side of James Bond I've never seen before. The main bad-guy though still felt a smidgen over the top though (considering how much more life-like the rest of the film seemed to be) you know with the bleeding eye and all. But that was really my only complaint. I loved the brutal torture scene. It leaves the one from Die Another Day feeling like the dejected ugly stepchild who messes himself every time he gets excited. I do honestly believe that Daniel Craig is the best bond to grace this (until now) stagnating franchise. Casino Royale brings a classy, witty, and perhaps now even a darker vibe to the table and I'm looking forward to more.",positive
its not quite bond but its getting there,positive
James Bond is a bad ass once again.,positive
Great first half then it falls to pieces,negative
"For the record, that wasn't really VT that Bond went into. Heart rate was too slow. Believe me, I know.",positive
Great start to the new Bond series,positive
aaahhh i really love james bond... handsome....,positive
First Bond movie I've ever stayed awake through.,negative
The names McPout. Pouty McPout,negative
"I'm not sure how to start with this one. I was hesitant to accept Daniel Craig as a Bond, but after seeing this film, I have no problem. A somewhat lengthy movie at almost two and a half hours, I must say I was pleasantly surprised when the plot would extend itself. This is one of the few reboot movies that actually left me thinking it was a good thing to do. I can even see how some people might view this as a sequel/prequel to the Bond Franchise. This movie not only succeeded as a movie, but it also succeeded in inspiring many people. I wonder how many people had Casino Royal parties with mixed drinks and card games because of this movie. And last but not least, what a great cast. Eva Green is now my favorite Bond Girl. Can I call her that? And of course, Judi Dench, Giancarlo Giannini, and the ""bad guys"" were great as well. A must see, and don't feel bad if you dress up to go see this film, I did every time.",positive
Waaaaaay better than Quantum of Solace.,negative
Great thriller. Eva Green looks better than ever.,positive
ass-kickery in action...,positive
I'm not use to this new Bond.,negative
"gd film , and actor , and charactar",positive
AMAZING...ENTERTAINING....WICKED!,positive
very over rated bond film but DC does make a good Bond,negative
"The new batch of movies with a new Bond. Craig does a great job, and the film is produced pretty well with a darker side to bond dealing with his emotions as we travel back in time to his younger days.",positive
"Have nothing against Daniel Craig...these are decent action films, not much plot and stuff...just don't like them as ""Bond"" films...",negative
"Pah, Craig is wooden",negative
I like the new kick your ass bond.,negative
"I hate James Bond films, but this was excellent!",positive
i don't like daniel craig as james bond; didn't care for this movie.,negative
"Brings Bond back to basics, with less gdgets and more hand to hand combat. Abandons all the silliness of past Bond films and makes this a more serious outing with Daniel Craig making Bond feel trully human.",positive
worst bond film i've seen,negative
"i personaly love james bond,but this one was kinda diffrent...not the same classic of bond,it has a love story and a new begginings... very oweome special effects.",negative
charming...an excellent bond film.,positive
Best Bond ever thanks to its realistic approach and action based on a concrete and solid story. DC is physical enough to make it believable.,positive
The best Bond film so far. Daniel craig adds alot of depth to the character and gives him a more realistic image. certainly more gritty and dark than the other Bond films.,positive
Mr Craig seems to be the best OO7.,negative
Really good! I wish the movie had been longer though!,positive
"the best bond movie there is, excellent movie filled with excitement and action that was intense",positive
"Its great to see James Bond played by a new unknown actor. I really enjoyed the new Bond. He has reinvented the character into a ""modern"" man and not the 1960s time warp womanizer. James desn't need Q anymore, just a Sony cell phone and car with a built in sick bay.",negative
Amazing. Hollywood learned to make Bond movies again.,positive
One day....A Big London Bus,negative
"Terriffic re-imagination of the Bond franchise, I miss the campy-ness but a great movie.",positive
"Wow, what a fantastic way to reboot the best movie franchise ever and Eva Green is just an awesome bonus ;)",positive
"One of my least favorite Bond films yet, because of its slow moving story and thug-like leading actor.",negative
"-Daniel Craig's acting was amazing!!!!!!!!!! -The rest of the cast inc. Eva Green (Vesper) was amazing -Was grittier, more realistic and less corny and flashy than Pierce Brosnan movies -Plot was a bit silly but it still worked because it was complex and thought provoking and most importantly- exciting. -Daniel Craig is gorgeous!! -In general, though, the James Bond series is a bit sexist (Bond always gets the girl no matter how obvious he makes it to them that he's a total player)",positive
for 2 hours of poker its pretty good,positive
"Not just an incredible Bond movie, but an incredible movie, period.",positive
judi dench.......but,negative
I was never into the Bond series but seeing this film has made me want to see all of them. It had some of the best acting I have seen for any action film. I loved Daniel Craig's and Eva Green's performance as Bond and Vesper and an excellent story. This has to be one of my favourite films I have ever seen under the action genre. I rate it 100% as it is to me the best film of 2006. I can't wait to see Quantum of Solace.,positive
Holy Cow. Daniel Craig is super hot. Love the new Bond.,positive
"Daniel Craig is a refreshing retake on the classic James Bond character. Craig pushes aside some of the former actors' charm and introduces a ""badass"" side of Bond. Very good action! Suspenseful! The ""Bond Girl"" plays a larger role in this movie. Will Bond get married? Watch and find out!",positive
Seen all the James Bond movies. There awesome.,positive
In my view... the best James Bond movie.,positive
"A proper JB reboot, too bad it went downhill from here.",positive
I'm not a fan of any James Bond movie...,negative
Mmm... definetely i do not recomend it... makes you miss Pierce Brosnan so much,negative
Best bond film eva also staring the best bond eva Daneil Craig!,positive
One of the James Bond movies. Good,negative
Great story. Best Bond film in a long time.,positive
james bond needs to die,negative
The initial chase sequences and fights were awesome. The last 3rd of the movie was just weird.,negative
A fine reboot to the James Bond franchise. A very satisfying film.,positive
Time for a serious Bond!!!,positive
"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...... (Couldn't imagine Roger Moore doing that opening scene, not in a safari suit anyway!!!)",positive
I really did not enjoy this movie at all.,negative
A reboot that is most fitting.,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery. He excels in convincingly portraying the duality of Bond's character. Very entertaining. Sets a high standard for following Bond films...,positive
Watched it twice THIS week. Need I say more?,positive
Watched it twice THIS week. Need I say more?,positive
"Wow! I don't have the same nostalgia for the old Bond movies as I know most people do. I respect them but if you love them alot the rest of what I'm going to say will probably piss you off. Most Bond movies were an amusing joke. Funny, entertaining, a little action thrown in but unbelievable unrealistic. I'm not going to say this movie is 100% realistic but it is done in a much more realistic way. A real life 007 who has skills not just a bunch of gadgets that do all his work for him. This is hands down my favorite of the 007. Amazing action scenes, great story, great cinematography, a definite must see.",positive
"Daniel Craig is much better than Brosnan and Moore, but can't touch Connery. This movie kicks butt. A more realistic Bond compared to past movies.",positive
"At last, a new best Bond.",positive
"The reboot this series needed. Serious plot, action, and no goofy bullshit found in the post-Connery era.",positive
"Watched but it really wasn't a ""Bond"" movie, no gadgets. It was good but not ""Bond""",negative
bond gritty but shaken or stirred,negative
"I am not a big James Bond fan at all because I think it is the same ol' story-lines but ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum Of Solace"" both stand out as the best of Bond by a long stretch of the imagination.",positive
boring not my kinda film,negative
Better than the one that came after this. Something about james bond doing something spyish.,positive
I really hate this movie.. the storyline sux..!!,negative
"A good ""reboot"" of the series (god do I hate that word); I particularly like the fact that, unlike previous Bonds, this one actually has the crap beaten out of him. I also liked the high-stakes poker game, although I have to admit that it seemed a little ridiculous (if you're MI6 and you know he's going to be there, why not just take him out?). But I'm thinking too much. This is a good action movie, and a Bond movie that won't rot your brain.",negative
"The only Bond movie that I've seen all the way through. Intense action, a confusing plot, and a really handsome yet imperfect hero make this a truly enjoyable film. It was a great setup for later movies and reinvented the Bond brand!",positive
Daniel Craig was so sexy in this movie! Dang.,positive
one of the best bond bond movies ages go and see this you wont be dissapointed,positive
daniel craig plays the hardest james bond.,positive
"okay movie. really intense scenes. the man that plays bond or whoever, is HOT!!",negative
"A bit dark, a bit too long for me and not your typical Bond movie. But this is apparently where it all began for Bond.",negative
GREAT movie! Daniel Craig is HOT as the new 007!!!,positive
"Daniel Craig brings to the table the most charismatic and brooding Bond yet, in this breath-of-fresh-air take on an incredibly stale franchise. Great acting, sensible plot, satisfying action and a grittier, more realistic attempt at the series make Casino Royale, in this writers opinion, the greatest Bond yet.",positive
"The best thing about this film was the beginning chase and was well done but I wasn't completly satisied with it overall. I have to give Daniel Craig props though, this was his first Bond film and he didn't do bad, though his acting could have used some work. One thing I wasn't comfortable with was the fact that it was more of a gambleing movie than a Bond classic, the real Bond would have had everything in the bag before the game began. The stroy plot was original from all the other Bond movies which is what I expected but the way the plot was delivered was the only problem. I didn't feel comfortable with the fact that this Bond movie was supposed to be like form the very beiginning, it was unsettleing in some ways. To end with it is worth watching for any Bond fanatic or action film lover but I don't see this one going down in history like Golden Eye did.",negative
Solid but not something I can ever envision returning to.,negative
They have changed the James Bond style dramatically. Casino royale is another quite different from other previous Bond's movies,positive
eva green vale la pelicula!,negative
LA MEJOR DEL AGENTE 007,positive
I hate the new James Bond...wat happened to the old lines james always said,negative
"Highly recommend...The film introduces Daniel Craig as the newest James Bond. He pulls it off splendidly and will undoubtedly be this generations Bond. It has all of the material expected of a typical Bond movie, action, romance, car chases, etc. The acrobatic chase scene through a construction site is intense. The limited focus on techno gadgets was a nice change. Although the debate on who is the better Bond will continue, I enjoyed this darker, grittier, and ""rough around the edges"" version. This is a must see Bond movie and one that will fit in most fan's collection.",positive
Bond with parkour! This is not a bad start for the new Bond direction at all. After this movie I was incredibly excited that Bond might be able to pull himself back up after the beat down and bloody nose the franchise received from the Bourne movies. Until I saw Quantum of Solace.,positive
"i'm not a huge fan of James Bond but this one i liked. A lot of action, i could follow the plot and Daniel was good in here. It was a bit dark but thats what made it good.",positive
"agen 007 again? wah, yang ni pn agk ok la... i love! tp ke'playboy'an beliau neh xde la npak sgt dlm ceter ni.. huu..",positive
"I saw this movie back in 06 and I was really impressed. It brought the James Bond films to a more realistic world, which was needed after Die Another Day. This movie is all good.",positive
I love Daniel Craig as James Bond. He's intense with those steely blue eyes and proves he's up to the job as the new Bond.,positive
"Craig is not my favorite Bond, But he is pretty good. Overall enjoyable",negative
I LOVE THIS MOVIE IT IS THE BEST JAMES BOND MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN,positive
new Bond new begining,positive
amazing film for the new man Daniel Craig. and brilliantly put together and such. Look forward to his next movies as Bond,positive
DANEIL CRAGE ROCKED THE CASBAR!!!,positive
"The best Bond movie ever made so far in my mind... the action is great, and it is a great prequel to the other Bond movies, and also a fine job done of rebooting the franchise. Daniel Craig doesn't need dark hair to be Bond, as he kicks ass just the same, if not more. A move violent, and reckless Bond, but still has the charm... I like this version of James the most.",positive
Great reboot of Bond...Daniel Craig is the best Bond!,positive
a very confusing movie with lots of shine but not much substance,negative
"Love this movie! Daniel Craig is a beast. Every fight scene, chase scene, intense poker scene is great!",positive
"good,but dont really like the new 007.",negative
Love it! :) Daniel Craig!!! :),positive
"I thought it was ""not their best effort.""",negative
"Although I am a Bond fan, I never had any desire to see this one. I just was a bit turned off that a random blonde guy I've never heard of [Daniel Craig] was taking over as 007. Maybe I am a bit prejudiced because I do favor tall, dark, and handsome, but I personally felt that Pierce Brosnan and Sean Connery were the best Bonds, although Roger Moore would definitely be a good third. It wasn't until it came on TV the other day that I finally decided to glimpse it at all. My original instincts to not see it proved correct. The plot was completely confusing and made no sense. I need a little bit more to work with than the general understanding that Bond is the good guy and whomever he's chasing is bad. The only movie where I've ever seen that kind of thinking worked plot wise was with Kill Bill, but even Quentin Tarantino made a sequel that explained more of what happened in the first one, so that example might not even technically count, which doesn't say a lot for this Bond movie. The only thing I really liked about the film had absolutely nothing to do with the plot, interestingly enough, but rather strictly with the romance in the film. This is the first Bond I've seen where he truly falls in love and sex is not the only thing to be gained. There is a lot of gradual tension and intimacy built up before doing the horizontal tango which is something new. Another thing was that Bond was actually willing to retire from the secret agent business for said love interest, played by the gorgeous Eva Green. Sadly, happiness never lasts and moments are fleeting. Bond's lady love ends up drowning and dying at the end of the film. I believe the follow up, Quantum of Solace, sort of builds on the plot line [him losing her]. I also will give Craig this: his hair is more dirty blonde than natural blonde, which makes him closer to the other Bonds. He definitely had the Bond attitude down [confident and sexy in his own way]. Never before have I seen such a mature Bond...that was truly surprising and enjoyable. Another enjoyable factor was having Judi Dench, once again, costarring. I love how I bet she could just kick everyone's ass, you know? She just has the tough, older woman thing down pack [also seen in Pride and Prejudice when she played Lady Catherine de Bourgh].",negative
"First half was okay, but the second half was like boring and bad plotline. So yeah I think they could have fixed it by cutting it up.",negative
love all james bond's move,positive
Loved it. From a huge James Bond fan.,positive
Oh yes! James Bond Is Back And Better Than Ever! Daniel Craig is great!,positive
Daniel Graig is a good Bond. But a Bond film where the climax is a game of cards? Fuck off,negative
One of my all-time favorite movies.,positive
the most beliveable bond movie yet,positive
"Raw and intense, Hard to watch in places.",positive
i watch dis it was not sooo gud n i don't like dis james bond he car act gud but it worth a 8...lol,negative
"This movie was alright. The chase seen at the beginning was awesome. Daniel Craig is pretty cool as Bond. Except for the fact that he shoots first, and asks questions later...",negative
I liked this movie but it didn't seem very much like a Bond film so in that respect it was disappointing,positive
"MAN, James Bond is back and fucking BETTER than ever.",positive
Best Bond in my opinion!,positive
2 words: Daniel Craig.,positive
"Starts out with an amazing opening song and brilliant parkour chase scene, plus a very gritty retelling of bond's first kill, but the movie loses energy and a serious bond in Mr Craig is too great a contrast with Mr Brosnan. I liked it, but I wish I could have liked it more.",negative
Must be the best Bond yet ...,positive
Not sure bringing realism and make him look like some Bourne flick in Bond is good. It's an alrigth action movie though. But a bad Bond,negative
James Bond does James Bond. Was exciting until I was forced to watch what felt like endless games of poker.,negative
I love this movie it was epic,positive
"Never imagined that Danial Craig would be a better Bond then Pierce Bronson, but HE IS! This is Great!",positive
LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie..especially the scene set in Madagascar! So cool!,positive
Love the new Bond style,positive
Mmmm .. I love the cars Only,negative
Fantastic film and Daniel Craig is the best bond yet.,positive
Great way to invent Bond again!!!,positive
"I have to confess, this was the first Bond movie I'd ever seen. I've since watched the older movies, and I've got to say, Craig portrays the character very differently from his predecessors. I can't decide if I like him better or not. He's got a quieter, less arrogant manner, and seems to care more about the women he *coughs* has relationships with. As a Bond newbie I was extremely impressed. I love movies about badass guys with guns. And Craig definitely delivers in that area. Judi Dench was amazing as well, playing M. I really liked this movie. :)",positive
"I need to watch it again since I fell asleep during the middle (due to tiredness and lateness, not boredom). But the parts I saw were good.",positive

where are the gadjets...,negative
"I'm a die hard Bond fan, been one since I was eleven years old, I've seen them all. or so I thought. This latest installment in the long running franchise is nothing short of brilliant action entertainment. It has all the elements, well almost all, that made the past Bond's so much fun to watch, that and more are the keys to this films massive success. Casino Royale takes us all the way back to before James Bond was a 00 and we get to see his rise to being the best secret agent around. This film disposes of the silliness and gadgetry that has plagued the previous Bond movies and it brings out the Bond we have been waiting to see: chaotic, haunted, vicious and ruthless. This film steps up the game and brings and proceeds non stop to take Bond to a whole new level. Daniel Craig(who deserves an Oscar by now.) plays Bond like no other. He puts out Bond aversion to getting dirty, sweaty, beaten up and bloody, he step's it up each time he put's the smack down on someone and put's his place as the number 2 greatest Bond in the franchise's history. Eva Green was alright, she wasn't the best looking Bond girl(trust me there have been better!) but she doers have a quiet subtlety to her character which is enough to get her by. Judi Dench is absolutely fantastic as ""M"" she brings a 45 year old character some class, style and tough motherly love. Jeffrey Wright as Bond;s oldest friend Felix Lighter is not as good as he could have been but he certainly is better than the people who played it before him, Wright brings allot of class and wit to Lighter. More so that he's had in the past and that makes him worthy of the role. But all in all the cat does splendid in there assigned part's and brings this film the direct power it needs. Casino Royale is powerful, dark, gritty, smart, Wild and crazy fun that is to be admired with the highest level of respect and gratitude. This film is a major, major notch above the rest of the Bond films and out classes and out fight's them in oh so many ways. This film is a favorite of mine and it's one that I can watch many times over It's a great love story and a great action film all at the same time; It moves across the screen with a pace that is easy to follow but yet at sometimes lightning fast. It's a great installment in the long running Bond series and will go down as one of the best. All in all Casino Royale delivers",positive
all the bond films are great but this is even better,positive
Llarga vida al nou James Bond! Ai omÃ¡!,negative
One of the Best James Bond's films.,positive
bond rebooted back to his 007 best,positive
"The tragic thing is, despite the great writing, visual style and overall fresh restart, it's still thrown into a pile of other Bond movies. I'd prefer the talent were used to start a brand new franchise. Still a great movie though.",negative
Best. Bond. Film. Ever.,positive
This was a great movie. Daniel Craig looked hot.,positive
the best bond...sorry Connery fans,positive
"great action,great chris cornell theme song.",positive
A truly great Bond film. Daniel Craig is amazing as the new 007 and Mads Mikkelsen does wonderful job as the villain. Casino Royale may be one of the best Bond movies.,positive
The new Bond kicks ass,positive
1 of da best films eva,positive
"like it because I saw it with the coolest guy ever, and best beginning ever. But is it a sequel or remake?",negative
I welcome this new Bond. Always loved the Fleming book. I thought they did it justice.,negative
"As a Bond fanatic, it's awesome. As a action movie fan, it's awesome. As a fan of intelligent thrillers, it's awesome. Winsome on so many levels it's ridiculous. Hell to the yeah on this amazing reboot.",positive

Easily the best bond film. Danial Craig is the most like the Bond from the books.,positive
i like this movie Daniel Craig is one of my favs action star!!!! but i love quantum of solace more... because camile and james have a better chemistry,positive
"Well done restart of a great character. Very entertaining, worth watching again and again. It's a little bit more realistic than Pierce Brosnon's Bond movies. I like Daniel Criag, wasn't sure at first since he has blond hair but he brought some attitude and emotion to the character.",positive
"It's amazing how thrilling a card game can be. Despite lacking a lot of traditional Bond flair, this definitely seems like a good direction for the superspy.",positive
"Sean Connery, to date the best James Bond there is. That being said, Daniel Craig is James Bond, but not the super hero never gets hurt James Bond, this is the human, fallible, James Bond. Oh yeah and he also kicks some serious ass in this movie. I was unsure I would like him as Bond, but he proved me wrong. Add Judi Dench to the mix and you have a great James Bond film. One of many I hope.",positive
Bond is back..... Love Daniel Craig.,positive
I still miss Pierce Brosnan as Bond but Daniel Craig has done a great job filling in the roll.,positive
Pretty good!!! But Blond Bond IS NOT better than the real bond!!!!!,positive
He orders the WRONG freaking drink!,negative
The original with Peter Sellers is better. Have it.,negative
"I've not been much of a James Bond fan in the past. However, I think that Daniel Craig is excellent in the role. This movie starts with a great chase scene that doesn't have any gadgets ... just Bonds chasing after a 'free runner' thru a construction site ... up & down the building ... truly remarkable chase. I also enjoyed Judi Dench portrayal of 'M'. I highly recommend this movie if you haven't seen it already...",positive
"A rougher Bond? Ooo..you just gotta love it? Bartender:""Shaken or stirred, Sir?"" Bond: ""Does it really look like I give a damn?"" Nice!",positive
"I m not a Bond fan. This film really introduces Bond in the new century's viewers. A more human Bond that does not bother to scream ""ouch"". Liked it.",positive
Best of 007 for the newer generation.,positive
"Great movie, possibly the best nond film ever",positive
Best bond movie to date,positive
"El James Bond de Graig es el mejor de la serie desde la epoca de Connery, una pelicula dramatica, veloz, llena de acción y gracia",positive
"I absolutely love bond movies. So, while this may be a good spy movie, it does not live up to the 007 tradition. I would have loved it if only it had not been a Bond movie. I miss the old James, with the gadgets, women, one-liners, and less unnecessary killing.",negative
another great bond movie,positive
"it's good,.. i really like it,..",positive
"This one is not my favourite Bond, but still a gooder.",negative
"A very good Bond movie, good beginning to the new series. Demonstrated a young Bond who just earned his 00 status and learns from his mistakes throughout the movie.",negative
"Daniel Craig, you were right.",positive
"Daniel Craig is a great Bond, even if he is a blonde.",positive
"good, but hey i miss sean.",negative
"Eva Green, oh Eva Green!",negative
"Best movie of the franchise, script, directing and acting were wonderful. Best grade of the franchise in IMDB. If you liked Daniel Craig in this movie, lookout for the british picture Layer Cake (2004), also with Daniel Craig.",positive
AMAZING! The best Bond yet...and this is coming from a die hard Bond fan.,positive
Horribly cheesy and unbelievable story from start to finish. After the first 10 mins I realized if I wanted to make it through this one i would have to just stop analyzing all the unbelievable and highly unplausable stuff going on. Plus this is nothing like the old James Bond movies at all. All that said the action and story were kinda good in a early 90's sort of way. I haven't enjoyed a bad action movie since then.,negative
another sequel of bond featuring Craig.....gud action...thats all...lol,negative
Only bond film i enjoyed!,negative
"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? A romantic family-movie? Sarcastic puns, where the HELL are you? Man, it is not the worst James Bond movie, it is NOT a James Bond movie. It's a CRAP! A SHIT!",negative
the older bond movies were better,negative
"Greatest, Bond movie, ever... bar none, not 1 boring part in the movie, AND poker..like.. wow",positive

it was a James Bond movie. that's says it all,negative
"It was good, but it was just tooooo loooong. Cut out a half hour and it would've gotten 3 1/2 stars, if not 4. The Bond women documentary in the DVD special features was pretty interesting, though.",negative
need to watch this again. Daniel Craig's Bond in this and Quantum is so beyond sexy it's a little mind shattering...,positive
"Awesome production. Didn't like Daniel Craig at first, but he is definetely a Bond. A must-see.",positive
bond is back to his menacing best. craig was made for the role,positive
"biasa aja,,,,bila dbndg james bond yg lyn,,,,,",negative
"The complete opposite of 'Die Another Day', 'Casino Royale' is an excellent example of a new product, while keeping it classic Bond. Daniel Craig is an excellent James Bond and any doubt that people had over him was quickly gone once they saw him in the role. He's a blunt instrument who slowly realizes what he truly means to the world by the end of the film. The villain is a great example of both a classic Bond villain, but also keeps him grounded in reality all while keeping him sinister and creepy. Eva Green does the character of Vesper Lynn justice and is a very good addition to the film, though her dialogue with Craig tends to descend towards the end of the film. The film's darker style really works in the films favor, which is ironic since Timothy Dalton was getting a bunch of flak for his darker version of Bond in 1987. Overall, the film is quite impressive and a great addition to the Bond legacy. Not one to be missed.",positive
Best James Bond movie ever made hands down.,positive
Daniel Craig have the neccesary to become James Bond and with this bright spectacule we may said that the franchise is going up! Bravo!,positive
it was pretty good. But not as good as the originals.,negative
hate this bond and the overblown action,negative
painful tourture part. it hurts me just thinking about it. awwwwww,positive
"It used to be the only James Bond movie I'd watched twice. Now it's the only James Bond movie I've watched three times. It reminds me of how much I used to enjoy Hollywood 'popcorn' movies twenty years ago, when they were not only breezy and fun but also well-acted, well-directed and well-written.",positive
Great action sequences...,positive
looooooooooooove it!!! Daniel Craig rocks!! The best James Bond ever!!!,positive
"This not 007, but could be 008",negative
"return to form for bond. well done you, sir",positive
By far the best Bond movie ever made.,positive
"THIS is how you make a fantastic Bond film. We don't have the special effects driven Brosnan era anymore. Instead, we have the emotional charged and realistically shot Daniel Craig era, and it is all the better for it. Daniel Craig is electric as Bond (my new personal favorite) and Eva Green is the sexy, but sly Vesper whom he falls for. It's a great romance, but Casino Royale really has everything. One of my favorite movies of the decade.",positive
"Brilliant reboot of the Bond franchise, stripping away the goofy gadgets & cartoonish villains that cluttered the series and returning 007 to his Flemming roots, that of a ruthless & efficient operative in Her Majesty's Secret Service. Thanks largely to Martin Campbell's superb direction (one of the best action directors of his generation) and Daniel Craig's brilliant lead performance ( the best Bond since Connery). He is matched perfectly by Eva Green, whose Vesper Lynd is the one Bond girl who gets under his skin. To date, still the best Bond film ever.",positive
daniel criag in pierce brosnan out yay!,positive
Love Bond!! James Bond!,positive
Craig as Bond. It simply does not work for me.,negative
"If not for Eva Green, I could consider this movie one of the worst I've ever seen...",negative
How much do I love this movie? It is such a perfect update of the franchise and Craig is perfect for the role. I regularly reach for this DVD when in the mood for action.,positive
"not to par with the other bond films, but a good film in its own right",negative
he was smooth in this,negative
"Too much action and too busy for Bond, but good film nonetheless",negative
"Tiene todos los ingredientes de una buena peli de Bond: escenas de accion imposibles, parajes exoticos, super villanos megalomaniacos, una secuencia de apertura extravagante con un gran tema musical, chica Bond inteligente, misteriosa y sensual, y por supuesto, un James que derrocha testosterona y arrogancia a la menor provocacion. Muy entretenida.",positive
Loved Daniel Craig as Bond!,positive
well made James Bond flick.I'm not a big fan of this genre but it held my attention and I really liked it. Daniel Craig is an awesome james bond!,negative
Oh wow! Daniel Craig as the next Bond?!? Loving it (him! lol) - Couldn't keep my eyes off the screen - Loved the plug for the new Airbus A380! Clever!!,positive
The worst of all the Bond actor's and film's,negative
not my favorite Bond movie.,negative
Never really pay attention to James Bond but this Craig's Bond is bad-ass!,negative
"Daniel Craig is the worst thing to happen to this franchise ever. This Series has been on a slow excruciating downhill slide since 1964, and I have lost all hope we will ever get back on track. Appreciate the producers wanting to get back to a grittier more believable Bond, but with Craig's casting what we have now is a Bizarro world, alternative reality, ugly James Bond. This is the worst example of casting in my lifetime.",negative
Great movie!! Loved it,positive
long long long! Un James Bond blond et bodybuildÃ© sans aucune classe c'est du n'importe quoi!,negative
Long live Bond! Best Bond film in a long time.,positive
The best Bond I've ever seen.,positive
"Action packed film, pretty spectacular stunts.",positive
luv the whole james bond thing,positive
"Great modern revamp of the Bond character. Some of the writing needed work, and too much poker.",negative
"Oh yes.. I went direct to play poker with friends.! Not so happy with the new James Bond, but well implemented.",positive
That torture scene with the rope is the most painful scene I have possibly ever seen. SUCH a good movie!! Bond is BACK! And with a vengence. lol,positive
I like how bond is finally becoming human,positive
Not the best James Bond but stuff blows up and cars.,negative
epic action movie bro..,positive
i hate his pouting!!! and him coming out of the water in a bathing suit is not that attractive. cool gadgets and sneakiness! :),positive
"tout va bien jusqu'à Daniel Craig en maillot qui drague... Il pouvait jouer un méchant mais pas James noooooon. Allez 2,5 pour l'aston et un demi pour l'action",negative
"Good acting, good screenplay, good directing, but there were a few mess ups. For instance, why would a terrorist organization hire a guy with burns on his face and hand. They would want someone less inconspicuous. I didn't see Green's death coming though, which was a surprise.",positive
"i don't know why, but i thought this movie kicked ass, despite the problems i have with the ending",positive
"this is by far the best of the 007 range, dark and sinister and truly the way Bond shuld be!",positive
Craig doesn't have the Connery pure talent but I like him better than Brosnan probably because he fights better.,positive
Craig is the best 007 after Connery. Thought I lost faith in the Bond flicks but seriously reconsidered.,negative
"Never like James Bond movies, but this Daniel Craig is A ok James Bond!",positive
"That movie hardly gets any rating for me the type of movie that fails to impress me full of stupid action scenes where the hero is a superman almost half the film is about Poker The heroine dies as a shot of getting us all emotional and stuff Stupid movie, Daniel Craig sucks as Bond",negative
JAMES BOND IS ALWAYS A WINNER IN MY EYES,positive
Daniel Craig is definitely the greatest Bond of them all - what an action figure...brings the Bond character to the heights it was meant to be...simply great!,positive
"Another great reboot for the series. Though there's no Q Branch, or various other Bond traditions, they're the reasons that this movie is so unique. Daniel Craig plays an excellent cut-throat Bond, while still maintaining the charm we expect from the character. Excellent action sequences, and a great cliffhanger. Definitly one of the best Bond films of our time.",positive
allow me to say this guy has revolutionalised the 007 character. simply awesome,positive
The best Bond film for years. Decades even. Ever..... needs time to settle.,positive
blond bond :) it was ok,negative
GREAT BOND A MUST SEE,positive
God a great Re-boot. Daniel Craig IS James Bond.,positive
surprisingly i liked this.,negative
it's probably one of my favorite James Bond franchise... such hard core fights and very palm sweating poker scenes... the flipping / trashing of the Aston Martin was visually stunning and unforgettable,positive
Not a fan of Craig!! I hate his face!,negative
awesome. new bond kicks it.,positive
"Daniel Craig still rocks as James Bond but this film did not meet my expectations. I really enjoyed Quantum of Solace while everyone else seemed to dislike it. CR got all the accolades as a return to form but I didn't care for this' re-make' as much, if at all. I was lost again in the plot holes and felt that the action sequences could not balance the melodramatic schlock of his instant love affair and the 'push and pull ' with M. How they also manged to make a poker game with millions on the line boring, I'll never understand. Keep shooting Craig, three times hopefully will be a charm.",negative
"The ""cruel"" James Bond begins....",negative
"Best Bond in the best Bond film. Plus, poker!",positive
ok not better than the old ones,negative
Daniel Craig maybe blonde but he's a capable Bond.,negative
James Bond is back in business. It's a must-see action flick.,positive
first half hour great... rest a tad boring... but made up for it in solance,negative
Daniel Craig will never be James Bond.,negative
"Okay, I'm a goof and I'll admit it, one of the biggest reasons I like this film so much is the production and film direction. The shots of the Czech landscape is nothing short of magnificent. With that said, it has a great balance between action and romance. I think this is one of the most romantic Bond films, and that definitely adds to its appeal. Modern, sleek, and professional. Typisk Bond.",positive
blah don't liike james bond movies,negative
"I have developed respect for Bond movies. I have to say though I approach them as comedy films, honestly. Based on that is my rating.",negative
A true return to form for Bond - Daniel Craig is the best there's been since Connery. This is top stuff.,positive
it really really great movie it our best movie as we watch it,positive
"Even being something like a bond movie, it fails to be a hot action favourite. In fact excepting the airport scene and a FEW other scenes, it's hardly good, forget wow! Daniel Craig is never a good lover in real life, and he fails here, erasing the romantic side of the movie from sight. Bond movies are not meant to be played just on Card games, is it? By the way, the lady in red, in the first place who died, was nice!! I might not have been professional enough to leave her like that!",negative
I think ive seen this...,negative
"This was an excellent entry in the James Bond franchise. While it is not my favorite, it's definitely one of the best in my opinion. The only real issue I have is the 1000 endings.",positive
"Good action, Daniel Craig is good, yet the movie is kind of on the boring side.",negative
"good bond film, felt bit bourne identy but good way to re start story",negative
"""I did like this movie and have it on DVD..but I love the older versions too""",positive
Wkd film loved it Aston martin and bond are realy nice =],positive
Without a doubt the best of the Bonds. Possibly the finest movie ever made about a guy killing a bunch of other guys while wearing a suit.,positive
"bond is back,thanks to bourne. a good re-brand full of action and suspence.Craig looks hot in a suit",positive
Did I only count ONE Bond babe in this show!? Gadzooks! What's the world coming to!?,positive
"I liked the style of this movie, but the plot was very hard to follow. Quantum of Solace is much better on both counts.",negative
Nothing like what Sean Connery pulled off but it's definitly better than Pierce's bond performances,positive
Good James Bond movie with sexy daniel Craig but a little long.,negative
I liked the original FAR better. ...and NO...he's NO 'James Bond',negative
WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER WITH PIERCE BRONSON! I HATE THIS DANIEL CRAIG THATS TRYING TO PLAY BOND.,negative
daniel craig is mint (L),positive
Amazing reboot of the series!,positive
"I'm a nerd, so I have to love bond. Wasn't sure about Mr. Blond Bond, but he does a good job.",negative
I hate jhate Daniel Craig as Bond. This Bond isn't a Bond movie it's just a thriller.,negative
The Bond franchise lives again! Mr Craig is good playing 007.,positive
A little bit disappointing compared to some old classic Bond films,negative
This movie just did not hold my interest. I am a huge Sean Connery/Pierce Brosnan fan but I found Daniel Craig immensely aloof and uninteresting. Where's the suave?,negative
What has this got to do with Ian Fleming's brilliant novel? Disgraceful rip-off,negative
Daniel Craig shines as the real Bond !!!,positive
my favorite james bond is Casino Royale,positive
"nom nom nom. still, the villain could have been, say, better? scarier?",negative
Best Bond movie in many many years.,positive
"I have to confess I still haven't seen most of the 20+ Bond movies, but this is easily the best I've ever seen. It presents a convincing, heartbreaking explanation for why Bond is the way he is. Daniel Craig is absolutely perfect, presenting Bond as a man with complex, suppressed emotions: he is not naturally a heartless killer, but he understands that he has to become one to do his job well. On top of all this, ""Casino Royale"" is a great poker movie. The pace of the action and suspense is very good as well.",positive
that is a great film! :),positive
love it! this is what Bond should always be and always have been.,positive
"A very good bond film, but it has removed all of the campy over-the-top cliches that made bond so good.",negative
Amazing movie. Great action and character development. Craig made me a Bond fan again. And Eva Green showed that accounting is still a sexy profession ;),positive
"Another Bond movie...but Daniel Craig, in my opinion, does a good job. Not quite as suave as I would expect in a Bond, but he does acceptable. Was an enjoyable movie.",positive

"First off, Daniel Craig, as usual, is quite good. Giannini, for a no-name actor also did well. (I know he did Italian cinema; Italian cinema doesn't count.) Good translation from the short story. Finally, an intelligent ""Bond girl"". Great effects. To replace what? Bond has always been a bit cheesy, a bit gadget-y, a bit male teen hormone-y. Arguably, Craig changes all that. Now Bond is cold, rough and utilitarian. Is this an upgrade? In my opinion, yes. Think Jason Bourne in America. But it will anger a lot of Bond fans. At the same time, Bond is due to receive some new fans, namely myself. It's a mixed blessing.",negative
"A lean, intense thriller that does two amazing things: reveals that Bond has a soul, and makes watching people play cards interesting.",negative
"i was impressed, craig is one of the best bonds yet. I think however this movie might have been made for fags because i sure saw a lot of Daniels body and not nearly enough of Eva Green's",positive
i wanna see it so bad. i luv james bond,positive
"LOVED it. But still haven't seen the first Daniel Craig Bond movie, and I hear it's way better.",positive
some great chase sequences but the exposition and love story were a little to obvious for my liking. didn't really care for the movie but i wouldn't say its bad either.,negative

"A james bond movie that can be taken seriously! Great story, screenplay, good acting and the best bond-director ever (also respossible for GoldenEye) - Daniel Graig IS the new James Bond - no question about it!",positive
Daniel craig pulls off a great James Bond. Well worth renting,positive

I'm all about Daniel Craig as the Bond of the new Millennium. GIMME MOAR!,positive
best bond fights ever,negative
A great way to revamp Bond - sadly followed by an atrocious sequel,negative
"This is an interesting Bond film. It stays very true to the original Bond Elements and others that are new and unique but it does have a great story, a majority of Characters I like and feel could have been better in this film and tons of great plot twists. Daniel Craig plays a younger James Bond and acts much like the original Bond with a new kind of style and more advance tactics. I like Bond's lover and his Villain who develop quite very well throughout the film but I do miss the secretary Miss Moneyperry and Q the Technical Man who shows Bond the gadgets and I feel that making M a female is quite the odd change because when first meeting M in the original series he is jokeful at times but is very serious as well but this female M is uptight and I don't like her much, I have nothing against the character being female its just that I have always felt it to be and always be a Male role. The music is very well done as well as the opening title sequence and main theme ""You Know my name"" one of my favorite Bond songs. Its told in a nice pace and this is one of the few Bond films that challenges the character James Bond into almost undetermined situations. Overall I like this film a lot but I can do without some errors and things I don't like about, I like it a lot nonetheless.",positive
Gamblin ... Bond.... Good combo,positive
Daniel Craig..........Yummy !,positive
"Best Bond, Best Bond Film Ever.",positive
"Not a huge Bond fan, but this film was good making me want to watch the next. Daniel Craig does a great job playing Bond, reminding me alot of the Connery run. The thing i enjoyed most was that this Bond was very beleavable. He looked like a secret agent would and could fight very well. Seemed alot darker than the other bond movies and felt in the same leauge as the Bourne movies.",negative
"Puissant, Daniel Graig pas mal du tout, Oh James.",negative
"If you ever want to see just HOW a James Bond movie should be made, watch Campbell's retro-classic. I wish the whole damn series had been only half as good as this..",positive

AWESOME!!!!! Loved Judi and Daniel. Am obsessed with Eva!,positive

Sophisticated relaunch of the James Bond franchise.,negative
never liked James Bond....i never get the combination between spying and women..,negative
"typical generic bond drivel, although the ridiculous running scene at the onset was somewhat riveting",negative
Action packed and a really good story as well. Suprised me and many of the Bomd fans just how good this was.,positive
"The best Bond Film in my opinion. I got bored of the over the top suarve sophistication and womanising secret agent with unrealistic and convenient gadgetry. Not to say some of the bond films were not great, just formulaic. Casino Royale however is much more raw, beleivable, action packed and still maintains the envious idol of the secret agent so well portrayed by Daniel Craig. It also maintains the production recipe of Bond films, with real stunts unaided by CGI effects.",positive
Favorite bond Movie!,positive
daniel craig v.yummy,positive
James Bond never fails to Entertain,positive
Very good for a Bond movie. I like this new Bond as much as Roger Moore and Sean Connery,positive

Daniel Craig was a good JB but Pierce Brosnan was better. I'm just sayin'.......,positive

Great restart to the Bond franchise!,positive

"nice but too much of look real makes some of the clips look unreal. full of action though, but i just don't get it, why the too much chasing on one scene?. got me pissed off. daniel chasing the black guy for more than 30mins of the clips! and finally caught the guy in his boss office, no sign of hard breathing on neither him nor the black guy's nice any ways",negative

"Really good, tense, well-acted and well-written.",positive

only seen parts of it,negative
I like Daniel Craig because he possesses the charisma and ruthlessness for a great James Bond movie. This is qualified by little or no smiles on his face.,positive
"Arguably the best Bond film to date, Casino Royale reboots Bond in a big way, gritty, terse and way cool, I didn't even mind the poker commentary, I'm a huge bond fan, so it shouldn't be a suprise to hear it from me, but if you didn't get a chance go see this movie. P.S. I don't normally go for Bond giving it all up for a girl, it didn't work in License to kill and as I started to see it happen in this film I got very worried, but as a set up to why Bond is the way he is and keeps women at the distance he does, I thought it worked well.",positive
ThisBbond is a shame to the Bond name,negative
Daniel Craig=hotty!!,positive
The best bond film ever made...no doubt about it,positive
classic! james bond still rocks.,positive
"A great return for the Bond series, Casino Royale brings back the films to where they should be. The Pierce Brosnan era started off well with Goldeneye, but the last film was too gadget based and Casino Royale with Daniel Craig brings it back to gritty action that makes the films so likeable.",positive
for those who just luv actions films,positive
I love this interpretation of James Bond!,positive
"Awesome recreation of the Bond character; Daniel Craig is amazing and brings an edge to the character that works brilliantly. It loses a half a point for dragging on in the end a bit, but the first 3/4 is movie making brilliance. 007 For the Win.",positive
It judt gos on and on,negative
i didn't get it. you could explain 100 times and i still wouldn't get it...so don't even try,negative
cute.. and handsome movie,positive

One of the best Bond movies ever. The first 10 minutes are the best action sequences ever,positive

I like Daniel Craig as Bond. He ads action to the character that has been greatly needed. The Long drawn out poker games were the downfall of this movie. When there was action it was real action.,negative
Daniel Craig does an excellent job as James Bond....he fits into the character perfectly!,positive
although ive only seen like half of it i still love it,positive
I don't like Daniel Craig as James Bond.,negative
Abit below standards for a bond movie...,negative
"Dopo il tristume degli ultimi film su James Bond, questo butta una sferzata di gusto talmente forte che stavo per avere un orgasmo multiplo in salsa barbecue. Non vÃ  solo visto ma rivisto almeno 3 volte. Grazie Sky.",positive

Parkour: I became addicted to it following this movie!,positive
I like Craig as the new Bond.,positive
"Perhaps the best James Bond movie to date. Not taking anything away from any of the previous actors but Daniel Craig kicks ass. Fast past, high intensity, non-stop action make this a heart pounding intense film.",positive
The best of the James Bond movies. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery and the action is Kick Ass!,positive
"A non-typical James Bond, too artificial, too passionate and too violent. Not worth of the franchise.",negative
Bond taken back to the basics. Love it.,positive

Loses two stars for putting his first mission in the future (present time) with regards to his previous missions (60's & 70's) :-P,negative

great movie piece ... back to the root's of Ian Flemming's vision of Bond,positive
"next generation of bond, like it very much",negative
"A blonde Bond is just too damn wrong for my tastes. It ignores the information given by the author. Sure we did see some rippling male bulging parts, decent ab muscles, a washboard chest you know sort of the sexy figure I have grown accustomed to seeing as a Bond. Alright action parts, decent story line and all that for a Bond show but Bond is not supposed to be blonde, old, wrinkly, disfigured by such enormous elephant ears, or really objectionable to the ladies in any way. I very strongly object to any blonde Bond and this old wrinkly big eared one is especially underwhelming because he is also not a good actor. I do think Judi Dench is fabulous though",negative
"Jus, loses points for the poker face scences. yoh Daneil craig! Eva green is beautiful!!",positive
odd story has many effects but the blod is seen to be fake,negative
Bond reboot. Awesome and action packed. Well done. This is a positive direction to go for this franchise.,positive
Disjointed. A destruction of everything that is James Bond. Bring back Pierce Brosnan and put this bitchy baby back to bed.,negative

Action -Packed.. I loved it,positive
"Best Bond film ever...Daniel, Pierce and Sean in that order...",positive
This James Bond is a little emotional.,positive
"ok...ok...what do we have here... 007 does it again, but when will you stop having it with the pretty gals, every time you hve to accomplish a tight mission",negative
So good! I wasn't too sure how I would feel about Daniel Craig taking over. I forgot I ever doubted him after the first ten minutes.,positive

Story- mind boggling but awesome My fave Bond film",positive

Daniel Craig as James Bond -- Yes!,positive
pretty good i'm not really a big james bond fan but i really like the new version b/c it's more about man power and not always about getting lucky with hot chick that he just saved.,negative

Entertaining but very much a guy's movie. Can't stand watching poker for more than 5 minutes.,negative
cant let myself love it- takes time 2 adjust 2 a new bond hmm,negative
some of it was boring but some was good.,negative
very well done bond movie. excellant.,positive
One of my top favorite Bond movies! :),positive
Finally bringing Bond in the modern context.,positive
"In his first 007 appearance, Craig delivers and this film joins the Bond film elite status ranks. Recommended.",positive
"He is not Bond. Monogomous straight-acted Bond is no longer the man he was. Bond should be cheesey and a serial womaniser. Sorry, but there it is. I feel like a British institution has been privatised and had bits sold off without my permission.",negative
waw waw waw! tout fan de James Bond a forcÃ©ment trouvÃ© son bonheur ici...et le reste s'en est sorti avec un bon film d'action pour une fois rÃ©aliste et violent. vive danny le petit dernier de l'Ã©curie 007,positive

"I watched it because I was seriously bored and it happened to be a DVD that works with PS3. I am not a James Bond fan. But I do love Eva Green. And it was very strange to see Bond say ""love"" to a woman.",negative
"the only thing is, body worlds grossed me out. if i don't want to pay for it in real life i don't want to see it in a movie either.",positive
"As both a kick start to the James Bond series and a throwback to the original vision of Ian Fleming's super-spy, 2006's Casino Royale is a sumptuous feast full of hefty courses of action, humor, and dramatics, the likes of which Bond audiences have not witnessed in some time. While nearly every fan of the series has his or her own favorite actor in the lead role, there's no denying that -- despite the early criticism -- Daniel Craig irrefutably nails his acting assignment with an assured performance that's equally magnetic in excitement and attraction levels. And while much was made of the stripping down of 007, most of what people love about the character is still there in one form or another. From the cocky looks to the crooked crooks, there's no doubt this is a Bond film through and through. As far as the action goes, director Martin Campbell takes a note from international cinema with the film's first big chase sequence, echoing the free-running sequences in District B13 as he deftly takes the awe-inspiring foot chase to a new, dizzying level. Backing up the whole ride is a solid script that throws viewers for a few loops along the way to the somewhat expected climax, which finds Bond hardened in his ""00"" status and, for the first time in a long stretch of the series' history, sets up a formidable villainous group for him to go up against in future installments. To put it in Hollywood terms, Casino Royale succeeds because of its skillful reinterpretation of what has attracted audiences to the character for decades now, although it is not without fault. First off, Chris Cornell's opening theme is completely misguided in its alterna-rock aesthetics, even if it's padded nicely by David Arnold's slick orchestration. Also, Bond films have always been notorious for skating the two-hour mark, but this 144-minute behemoth is just long enough for most audiences to get antsy as 007 finds love in a string of scenes that could have easily been whittled down in the script stage. Despite these hiccups, the franchise is livelier than ever with this revamp. This might be a grittier Bond full of far more emotions than gadgets, but it's hard not to be excited when the full-blown theme emerges at the end, promising more fantastic adventures to come.",positive
"good movie, but still think Clive Owen shoulf ahve been our next Bond,can't get into Daniel Craig and peobably won't ever the second Bond movie he squences his mouth up so tight I thought his teeth would break",negative
terrible Bond film..had it just been an action film it MIGHT have been ok....,negative
"Daniel Craig is perfect as Bond, who easily outperforms his predecessors. Craigs portrayal of Bond is what Ian Flemming would have wanted to see in a film adaptation of his first Bond novel.A cold, calculating, deadly secret agent.Eva Green is the perfect casting choice for Vesper Lynd, she does the part so well and acts so beautifully it's just amazing. The film is technically flawless, the story is perfectly balanced throughout, every actor is perfect for their roles, and it leaves you wanting more. I've yet to see a more well done movie than this one.",positive
"Okay, I gave in. I told myself I would not ever see Casino Royale. This was not the first Bond movie I've seen. I remember watching Sean Connery in Gold Finger and alot more of his I don't really remember. I've seen all the Peirce Brosnan ones. I didn't like the sex scenes, of course, but they had something about them I liked. However, another few reasons I did NOT want to see this one because I didn't like they chose a 'blonde Bond' and that, even though the others did have some pretty bad bedroom scenes, no other Bond movie I am aware of was rated for nudity, which this one was. Those two reasons made me mark this off as I did. But, it suddenly ended up being one of the movies that wiggled it's way onto the list of movies to rent. Him being blonde I could get over easily, but the way he acted kinda bugged me. The first fight scene made James Bond just look old and decreped and like my mom pointed out some of his looks made you think of Nicolae Carpathea. It was more of a no-nonsense kind of Bond movie, with alot of battle sequences that kept you guessing when they would end. Of course they had the sex scenes Bond is known for, but just under a half-a-dozen (three of which were consecutive at the end) were too much. Also, the Bond girls in this one were both bad and which both die at the end. Seems to break another tradition. Ah, and the nude scene was actually them torturing him by hitting him hard in the lower regions. They didn't show anything, and I've seen worse in movies not marked for nudity. Go figure. Someone pointed out they were trying to 're-create' Bond as they did with the 'Batman Begins' movie. And it was very different. But why change something that was good from the beginning? Batman I understand with the lameness of some of the old ones, but why do you feel the need to go back and redo the Bonds when they all did so well? They did go more in-depth into Bond's personal dillemas and you get to know how Bond became who he is, I'll give them that. But for me, I prefer going back and watching the Sean Connery or Peirce Brosnan ones any day.",negative
Surtout pour la musique de Chris Cornell,negative
"I've seen 2 bond films now,it wasn't to bad either",negative
"Great way to pass the time on an airplane flight. This, the first ""Bond"" story is classic Bond, but even faster, grittier, and w/o all the cheesy one-liners. Great chemistry between Bond and Lynd. And the villian, Le Chiffre, is one of my favs so far. Warning: the ""chair"" torture scene will make the men in the audience wince, but it proves 007 has what it takes.",negative
YUMMY!!! That's all I can say. Watched it with two of my girl friends at a girls movie night... need I say more... PS the other movie was The Holiday...We weren't watching only for the plot and action...,positive
"The first story of Bond series, and Daniel nails it like the hammer of the gods.",positive
"The best Bond film i have ever seen.Action packed to the end,and tragic to the point of exasperation! Daniel Craig plays a harder Bond.Still has that bit of humor,but he is much darker in character.Eva Green is one of the best bond girls i have seen too.One to watch again!This change in direction has breathed a new lease of life in the Bond franchise.May it last!",positive
UFFF!!!! how can you not like this film?,positive
"Sorry, one of the most boring Bond flicks ever.",negative
"i think it took the charm out of the bond series, it was good but its not what i look for in my 007.",negative
it was a good Bond film. I liked Daniel Craig as Bond good match.,positive

Best bond with a good story and an awesome actor. Daniel Craig kicks ass in this movie and is 10 times better than the last few bonds.,positive
THE best Bond... ever! We said it before anyone else did.,positive
badass.. second one is better,negative
the parkour bit warranted a rating over zero (or half).,negative
"Let us be honest, this movie gets more attention and praise than it deserves. First of all if I wanted to watch people play poker for a long time, I would watch the World Series of Poker and not a James Bond movie. Second the plot was hard to follow and there was not a lot of action, and the audience is left with lots of questions. I felt like something would happen in the movie then they would sit around and talk about and explain what just happen. I would look for a different bond movie if you want to watch one.",negative
i liked it. daniel craig did good for his frst bond film,positive
This film was actually not as boring as its ads would have had me believe.,negative
"This so-so action picture really features little spying... and Craig makes a great Bond but for one problem: the filmmakers give him barely any lines for the first forty minutes of the movie! He's certainly got the assassin's swagger down, but the storyline and plotting don't feel as engaging as they are on paper. Instead of being stylishly shot and tensely edited, the card game sequences are flat-out boring. The action is really good, but there's no real suspense to anything else. After twenty Bond films, however, that's the problem. Without a director with a sinister sense of narrative structure to match the now-coldblooded nature of OO7, the film just seems to drag. I give them credit, though, for getting Bond away from the good guy superhero mold and making him a character one would legitimately fear in real life. Espionage is ugly, not noble, and CASINO ROYALE at least follows that truth. And my, oh my, Eva Green is absolutely beautiful.",negative
Daniel Craig = worst bond,negative
Boring not very good dont like the new Bond that much classics are better,negative
the best bond & the best bond movie,positive
Daniel Craig plays an awesome Bond.,positive
"When interviewed, Daniel Craig is about as charismatic as a lettuce, but as Bond he is fab!!!! This was fast paced, exciting and very entertaining. Really enjoyed it - looking forward to watching Quantum of Solace. Oh, and how dreadful was the torture scene???",positive
No in your face product placements or over the top action sequences. Just old fashioned espionage.,negative
"Not really a let-down because I was expecting it to be shit. Craig does play this particular role really well, you couldn't imagine Connery or Moore doing a role like this and there-in lies the problem. This to me is not a Bond film. There's no one-liners and no gadgets. His Bond car assigned to him is a Ford to begin with lol. It's sad to see a film series that has inspired so many other great films now just turned into a derivative 'action film' complete with clichÃ©d parkour scenes and Bourne style action. Special mention must be made of Sony, they get absolutely everywhere, I've never seen such shameless and horrible product placement in my life. It was a good 2 hour advert and some of the action set-pieces were ok, but done much better elsewhere. I'm sure Americans will appreciate this new Bond but to me it's lost what made it quintessentially British.",negative
This was actually decent compared to Quantum.,negative
"Even though i find that Daniel Craig is no Pierce Brosnan, i sure do agree that he does a fantastic job in portraying Bond's character. More realistic, emotional, and it even has a pretty good story to it. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and MY GOD WAS THAT TORTURE SCENE BRUTAL OR WHAT?!",negative
he is a differ type of bond,negative
"This film changed the face of the Bond series forever. Based on the original Ian Flemming book, there is much more character development involved than the previous bond films. Much like Batman Begins did for Batman, this film brings a more realistic element to the story.",positive
"After all these years, this movie is still the gold standard for the modern Bond with perfect splash of classic. Also, Vesper was the one, worthy of his thoughts.",positive
Eva Green-- And it's a good movie.,positive
daniel craig is the best bond to date in my opinion,positive
"the best bond ever. Edgy, realistic, strong.and can anyone else be more manly than Daniel Craig??",positive
"Daniel Craig portrays Bond in a very realistic manner and unlike past instalments in the franchise the gadgets are fewer and seem more realistic. Fast cars, beautiful women (Eva Green is soooo hot!), cool gadgets...this ones got it all. In my opinion THE BEST BOND FILM EVER.",positive
"not bad. craig is not riger moore or dalton, but he tries in his workman-like way and his persistence results in good performances.",negative
The greatest Bond film in my opinion.,positive
"Daniel Craig...guns...blow up...money...guns...what's not to love? Besides Eva Green, that is.",positive
"A fresh approach to the James Bond franchise. It incorporates the fast-paced story-driven action of the Bourne films, while also maintaining tongue-in-cheek humour and a dramatic backbone that creates a new kind of Bond story. Daniel Craig embodies the character of 007, making him more human, as well as rough around the edges and far more brutal in terms of personality.",positive
Didn't like it as much as I liked Quantum of Solace...,negative
James Bond has never been more violent or kick more bad guys butts! It's flat out awesome! Here's a guy movie if ever there was one!,positive

the best bond movie hands down. one of those rare movies that is better than the book.,positive
"A superb action movie! It's just not really a ""Bond movie."" And despite what most people say, it's not really a ""reboot"" either. He gets his double-O license in the first scene and we don't learn anything new about him that we don't already know (unlike Batman Begins where we see an actual history and origin story). Additionally, there is no panache, no wit, little humor, no Q, no gadgets and no Miss Moneypenny. If they didn't call him Bond by name, we would never know we're watching a Bond film. But those quibbles aside, the movie is extremely entertaining and great all the way around.",positive
"It's a good reinvention of the series I guess, but I dunno...second time round I watched this, I got bored.",negative
that one dude used that giant whip to tickle his gibblies. hilarity in the midst of pain.,negative
"Very gritty installment, very fresh with a top-notch Bond. This guy has all the looks, attitude (swagger), charisma and finally the physicality to be a really believable and explosive Bond. Really good film.",positive
"went on a bit, but good.",negative
Bond returns to true Ian Fleming style in this gritty actioner. Daniel Craig's debut as Bond is superb as the story tackles the only Fleming book left untouched. The action sequences are fantastic (especially the harrowing foot chase in the beginning) and even the poker game garners some true tension.,negative
"I like this Bond! Before he became the suave, smooth talking casanova, Bond is all action! He even bleeds (properly) in this one. Best Bond of our era.",positive
"I haven't watched many 007 movies, but this one was one of the better ones. Only a couple parts that were greatly exaggerated and a bit too ""Hollywood"" if you will. But, it was riveting enough to hold my interest, so that was more than I expected. I'm looking forward to seeing Quantum of Solace next.",negative
"I really thought they did a great job with this movie. I have recently watched the first Pierce Brosnan Bond. This movie was 100 times that movie. Brosnan movie was campy with a throw away plot. Casino Royale was riveting. I don't mind the ""less refined"" Bond at all. Of course, I didn't have anything against Timothy Dalton either, and he was ""less refined."" I would highly recommend.",positive
Best Bond since Sean Connery. Like how it's been reimagined in a dark and gritty way. Judy Dench is great as M.,positive
"desde ese dia, james bond le tiene miedo a los huevos estrellados",negative
So wie Bond sein soll,positive
this is not a bond its a mission impossible with a bond title,negative
"I was worried at first about Craig, but his Bond is very exciting to watch.",positive
Texan Holdem..anytime,negative
"This is how Bond is suppose to be done. None of this drinking constantly tryin to nail anything not nailed down. Bond has arrived and he is a man of action, and action is what you get. This movie grabs you by the short and curlys and doesn't let go until the end with a very uncharacteristic ending. It sets the tone and pace for the next generation of Bond. It has a story to tell and this is how it's done.",positive
Loved this. This is the James Bond Ian Flemming wrote about.,positive
Great reboot to the ailing Bond series.,negative
"Daniel Craig rejuvenated the Bond series with this wonderfully active and exciting movie. He somehow made Bond seem more real even within a world so far removed from my own. I mean I play cards occasionally, but Bond makes the whole movie sing with energy, style, and intensity!",positive
"I really enjoyed this new james bond introduced by Daniel Craig! Brilliant, action packed and funny!",positive
Much better when watched together with The Quantum of Solace. Great reinvention of the character.,positive
Not really much happens. It's mostly just about poker and a girl. I was sort of disapointed.,negative
"Casino Royale, a truly exciting Bond and Daniel Craig pulls off a Bond that is a bit less refined and more human.",positive
"really good moive, took aa while to finally come around to it, but it was a really good movie from start to finish",positive
Awesome movie for Daniel Craig!! Bringing James Bond into 2000 with a bang!!!,positive
My faith in the 007 franchise has been restored.,positive
Casino Royale :: Die Another Day Filet Mignon :: Dog Diarrhea,positive
best bond movie i seen,positive
James Bond.. great movie..,positive
"Despite being the usual James Bond plotline, this film managed to interest me and I usually don't like Bond movies. Some great stunts, good acting although I don't like Daniel Craig.",positive
FAVOURITE MOVIE EVER!!!,positive
"Tough, gritty and cool. What a great reboot of the Bond series. Dumping all the junk and just keeping whats needed, fists and foots. And there are plenty flying in this pic. See it or ill put my foot through your chest.",positive
"He's not 007: he's James Bourne! ("",)",positive
my favorite that ive seen,negative
"By far my favorite Bond film, Casino Royale is dramatic, action-packed, and very well-casted! See RT? I can come up with a short description!",positive
Daniel Craig is too much of a rough and tumbled kind of guy to be Bond. He needs to be tough but distinguished too.,negative
Daniel Craig lives up to Bond,positive
"Like most Bond films, fun to watch, entertaining, and I will probably forget about it within a few days.... except for the torture scene... that will stick with me for awhile.",negative
"It was quite good, boring at times",negative
AWESOME. I watch this over and over. The best Bond film ever.,positive
Esse Bond é muito sem graça... O filme até que foi bom.,negative
I'm a sick Chiq for a Bond flick!,positive
i expected a lot more... but the very beginning chase scene is pretty badass!,negative
Great start to the atual story of James Bond. 8/10.,negative
One of the best Bond movies!,positive
que lnido New Bond que tenemos! Y la peli esta muy bien!,positive
Daniel Craig produces a mesmiring Bond in his opening role not as good as 2008 quantam of solace but nevertheless exceptuanal,positive
A kick ass jump start for a new Bond.,positive
The best movie ever made. This is my all-time favorite movie.,positive
Van a seguir!!!! Hasta donde van a seguir dañando a James Bond por Dios!,negative
this is one of the best Bond movies,positive
didn't really get all the hype,negative
"""Casino Royale"" was recently voted the number one greatest remake of all time by LoveFilm.com. Saving a franchise that was failing faster than a 4 year old at expert sudoku, the film transcends the term 'remake' and falls into a genre carved out by Matt Damon and the Bourne franchise. Undeniably slicker than Bourne the re-vitalised Bond avoids any more comparisons by the amount of fun the filmmakers have. Knowing winks towards the audience and references abound as we are shown Bond's first mission as a 00 agent. And what a mission. Beginning with a sleek, black and white opening we jump to Madagascar for some free running genius before nearly blowing up a plane in Miami, the most exciting poker match I've ever seen, before winding up demolishing an entire building in Venice. It's awesomely paced and the action sequences are some of the most inventive and engrossing Bond has ever seen. Craig (the first bonde Bond) is absolutely superb, infusing the role with just enough arrogance and vulnerability. He demands empathy with his performance and I flipping gave it to him. The rest of the cast are superb, with special mention to Danish sensation Mads Mikkelsen. Weeping blood, he's a fabulous bad guy and a real creep. ""Casino Royale"" then is a well needed boot up the behind for Bond and one that will go down as probably the best thing to happen to the franchise. The name's Bond, James Bond with five stars.",positive
Bond -- doing what he does best,positive
It's nice to see them actually telling a story with Bond.,negative
Daniel Craig som Bond - helt ok.,negative
"James Bond, stand out movie.",negative
"Probably the best Bond film since sometime in the 60's. Goldfinger or From Russia With Love. Finally they cast an actor as Bond instead of, you know, someone who looks like the cultural subconscious's image of a James Bond. Martin Campbell is probably the best director to ever work in this franchise. Also, it fucking rules.",positive
"Best bond in my opinion, but would still be beaten by Bourne",positive
This movie is too actiony for me,positive
Easier to understand than the other Bond films and had more of a twist which makes it best one ive seen,negative
it's easy to get lost in the story line,negative
"[font=Franklin Gothic Medium]The best thing about Casino Royale isn't the individual facts of Bond falling in love for the first time, of Bond sweating for the first time, of Bond crying out in agony for the first time or Bond crying for the first time. The best thing about Casino Royale is a combination of all those reasons and for the FIRST TIME in the series , we find out that James Bond is in fact vulnerable, and that he is HUMAN. And for all those femnists who have been hating on 007 for all these years, this movie gives you a reason to be sorry for him instead of hate on him.[/font]",positive
the greatest spy movie,positive
eh. dont really like daniel craig and his stupid duck lips. the movie was good though.,negative
The dawn of a new James Bond!,positive
These new Bond movies are really good and really action packed :D,positive
Not Bad fore an embarassing James Bond Movie. Guilty Pleasure!!,negative
"I hate daniel craig as bond he's rubbish, bring back Pierce!",negative
"I LOVE THIS FILM. It makes me cry for hours, sometimes i stop it before the bad bit and pretend everything ended Okay. Although people may complain about how the original was better etc.etc. I still love this film.",positive
rocked my world absolutely every single second was wicked!!!,positive
A minor masterpiece of the genre.,positive
This movie as gotten me interested in James Boond 007 again good work guys,positive
This dude's eye's are creepy and intense. The movie is great. I never was interested in the earlier Bond's but I really like the last two.,positive
"What a James Bond movie should be: Action (but not ""dumb"" action), beautiful women, betrayal, mind games, etc. What made this so great was Daniel Craig's portrayal as Bond. You see his anger and hate in this movie vs. the ""suave"" and ""cool"" Bond that has always been on the screen. Brava!",positive
a return to form in the bond series and craig is a good match for bronsan,positive
"A great Bond film. Daniel Craig delivers a kick ass and suave James Bond. I will miss Pierce Brosnan as Bond but Craig definitely does the role justice. The action in this movie is there in itts typical awesome Bond fashion. The main reason why I think this is such a good film is because Martin Campbell is the same person who Directed GoldenEye, which is my favorite Bond film.",positive
Daniel Craig makes a excellent Bond. This is a wonderful film and probably one of the best in the last decade or do. Fab story,positive
"Here's the setting : A huge uproar that the next Bond is blonde. A new website called 'craigisnotbond.com'. Fans screeching about the travesty of replacing the ever wonderful Pierce Brosnan. And what does Daniel Craig do? He goes on in all his hotness and brilliance and gives us this awesome film. And everyone goes mum. That's the style you expect from a man playing Bond. And Daniel Craig...whoop! Thanks so much for this great film, Craig and Martin Campbell!",positive
Really like the Craig version of Bond: he actually feels like a real person (a borderline psychopath) here and the plot is something you can actually imagine happening somwhere in the world right now. Actions have consequences and the gadgetry doesn't make the move feel like a bad sci-fi like many other Bond movies.,positive
"Very good 007 film! Over 2 hours of excitement, thrill, drama, twist and action.",positive
"An excellent introduction to the harder-edged Bond portrayed by Daniel Craig, Casino Royale suffers only somewhat from overlength in the middle and a tendency to overindulge in the poker scenes. Outside of this it is an awesome James Bond movie that takes the bad taste of Pierce Brosnan out of our mouths and re-invents Bond as a kick ass, take no prisoners hero for a new era. With solid performances from all comers including great turns by Giannini, Wright, Mikkelsen, Dench and of course, Craig, this film is a must-see for any Bond fan.",positive
"pretty good movie for a reboot of the series, action packed, Daniel Craig does a nice job...Eva Green's portrayal of Vesper Lind was also very good...",negative
Excelente el principio de la peli y Eva Green. Dps un desastre,negative
"Good action film but not that good 007-film. That typical 007 ""x-factor"" was missing. Daniel Craig is ok but doesn't beat Connery or Brosnan as Bond. Judi Dench is fab as M.",negative
I don't think it would ever be my favourite Bond film but as a movie movie it is simply outstanding. Daniel Craig is the Bond we always needed and makes Bronsan's run look pretty weak by comparison. Better then it ever had any right to be!,positive
I was quite impress with Daniel Craig as the new James Bond. I fought it was really good.,positive
"Great, amazing, fantastic...this movie blew me away...it was awesome!",positive
one of the better bond films without Sean,positive
I need to see it again because I missed most of it but from what I did see this was an awsome movie,negative
With the exception of Bond falling for a girl. Great Movie,positive
GODDAM what a good film!! I love tha James Bonds and this one rivasl From Russia with Love as being the best of them.,positive
"The Bond movie I always wanted to see--easy on the gadgets and jokes, heavy on the license to kill. The first Bond since Connery that you believe could kick someone's ass. Eva Green and Daniel Craig actually had chemistry. Eva Green actually had something to say. My only complaint was how Giancarlo Giannini was wasted when someone decided the audience couldn't follow the card game without Giannini's Mathis providing a play-by-play exposition.",positive
"Bond is back! Finally we get a Bond that returns us to the awesomeness that was Roger Moore. Pump up the action and just hint at subtle romantic interests, the series is about being a spy anyway, not who'll be the next Bond-girl. The only negative would be the length. I think it would have been fine to have ended the movie just after the card game instead of extending it another thirty minutes.",positive
First try for Daniel Craig but it was a good one.,negative
"Fantastic! Eva green is hot with those dark eyes. Great poker scene, weldone Daniel Craig.",positive
"What's so good about this movie is that James Bond is totally recreated, for the first time in the entire series, we find out that James Bond CAN IN FACT FALL IN LOVE, and that he is HUMAN",positive
"Daniel Craig is a bad ass, rugged, no nonsense bond, definetly not a let down!",positive
"I am shocked by how much I loved this film. James Bond is now the Bond of the books - he's a hardened professional killer, not a poncey ladies' man. And it's more than 'just a Bond film', destined to be mindless post-Xmas-dinner veg out. There's a storyline! There's twists! It's unpredictable and not just a pastiche of set-pieces! Yet the set-pieces are still there, and there's still all the glamour and excitement. Daniel Craig may look like a potato, but his Bond is the sexiest ever.",positive
"Craig is good, the movie is better around him. Gritty, good action, a pre-title sequence that truly sets the tone, and an overall fun experience.",negative
I like a darker Bond character as I think it shows more depth and Daniel Craig did this well. Craig harkens back to the Sean Connery Bond and puts his own modern touch. Well Done old Chap. Eva Green is enticing.,positive
Great retooling of the franchise!,positive
007 he is the right one,negative
"So I had the pleasure of watching both of the newer James Bond Films this weekend. I started with Casino Royale and was very impressed. I have never been a big fan of Bond films but Daniel Craig and the story that they use is so much more believeable than any in the past. I loved the action, the story. Both worked very well together. I have to say I loved this movie and it built some anticipation for Quantum of Solace.",positive
"Casino Royale ws a great movie, I think Danie Craig was more suitable than Pierce Brosman.",negative
Saw it it as cool action packed,negative
i just dont see daniel craig as bond...sorry its wrong,negative
"The 21'st Bond film, and it is my favorite. At 2 hours and 24 minutes, it packs in a smart and emotional story line. Exciting and stylish, exactly what you need in a Bond movie. Excellent acting all around.",positive
Best Bond movie since Thunderball and the best James Bond since Sean Connery. Daniel Craig defies the critics and literally blows this movie up. I can watch this one over and over....except for the part where he flips the Aston Martin. Such a waste......,positive
This is a great film! If you like spy movies you'll love it but for the die-hard Bond film it may disappoint,positive
"Thought this movie was great! Every time I thought something was going to happen, it switched gears. I REALLY enjoyed this movie. Daniel Craig is no Sean Connery but he does a great job as ""Bond, James Bond"".",positive
"What have they done????? For me OMG not bond what so ever. The guy is a great actor & love is work but he is no James Bond in my mind. I have given it 3 stars and i am not lookin at the film as a bond film at all. 1) I watched it the first time and hated it. He is not bond and never will be and the hold film was pants as if bonds not right then god help us. 2) watched it a second time with it in my mind it's just a film ( NOT BOND ) I loved it. full of action, sexy ladys, cars, bad guys etc and had some great one liners and conforsations which me and me fella was laughin our heads off. worth a watch as a normal film but i think they need to look for a new bond as it's just not happenin with this one! xxx :)",negative
"Solid, solid flick but doesn't really feel like a James Bond movie. maybe that's a good thing.",positive
"An excellent re-boot of the Bond franchise, and it is one of the very best in the series. Craig is a phenomenal Bond, and the film gets big bonus points in my book for being very faithful to Ian Fleming's novel.",positive
Refreshingly awesome. ^^,positive
http://static6.flixster.com/static/images/done.gif,negative
"Not quite the best Bond film ever (that'll be Dr. No) - but the best in years. Rewatching the Pierce Brosnan 1's after seeing this made me realise just how poor they actually are. This is how a spy thriller should be done! The action scenes are incredible yet compliment the story, the poker scenes are surprisingly tense and engaging and the acting in particular is supurb. The ending very nearly lets it down but all-in-all this is top-rate entertainment!",positive
"A really nice reboot to the Bond series which makes up for the campy films at the end of Brosnan's run. Craig definitely has an interesting portrayal of JB, despite some of the bad press about his selection prior to the movie. Very plausible. Some good parkour stuntwork (although done better in Banlieue 13 imho). Good, compelling story as well, although it is quite clear that the original story was updated (e.g. Texas Hold'em instead of Baccarat as the game).",positive
Best Bond film for a long time. Craig brings a new hard edge to the series that's been missing since Connery.,positive
really good. I like Craig as Bond,negative
"went to see it at the pictures and thoroughly enjoyed it, felt like a kid after I'd seen it, superb. Craig is just what was needed and the action sequences were expertly handled. A great story and better than Quantum although i really like that movie now. But Casino just wins out.",positive
We see the first big assignment of James Bond. At one particular point I almost cryied in pain as I emphatised with Bond.,positive
"After years of silliness, Bond is finally back. Daniel Craig is the best Bond in years, bringing a much needed sense of brutality to the character. Unlike some of the other versions of Bond, this one is not someone to mess with. He might be the only Bond that you'd actually believe to be a secret agent. The rest of the cast is great as well. Everyone seems to be taking it seriously, which I can hardly say for half of the people in the post-Goldeneye movies.",positive
"Hugely enjoyable. Daniel Craig is superb in the role, supported by great action scenes, and a decent story. A reboot as such and just what Bond needed, a more realistic film than the later Brosnan flicks. Up there with the best.",positive
"I didn't think I was missing much by not seeing a post-Goldeneye Bond movie, but I was clearly wrong. With the developed plot, interesting new takes on characters, and modernized thriller-genre storytelling, I would call this the ""Dark Knight"" of Bond films.",positive
"Daniel Craig makes for a great bond. Great story, lots of action and suspense, and of course a girl or two. Key moment: first 15-20 minutes.",positive
daniel craig is officialy the best bond around !,positive
I LIKE THE NEW BOND HE IS THE COOLEST STONGER THEN ALL OF THE OLDED ONES,positive
"""I'll raise you, Mr Bourne""",positive
"i watched the movie with low quality (i mean the dvd was pirated) what do i think of the movie? i think i don't understand the first scene ( though it looked like a jumpstart), i think it was not a good start... but the rest of the movie was ok..still i like it..",positive
Great start to a new bond and one of the better one's in my opinion,positive
"This reinvention of James Bond is hands down dead on. James Bond as a cold blooded, well trained assassin for the British goverment. Then we find out why he is this cold blooded womanizer and what makes him this way. Daniel Craig is the best James Bond since Sean Connery and hes in the shape you'd think a top assassin would be in.",positive
The best one out there,positive
"There is only one movie franchise that has twisted, turned and reinvented itself on so many occasions...007 has unfortunately dwindled more than it has bedazzled over the last decades but I am relieved to see that Martin Campbell has put the edge back into the Bond series. Well certain people thought Daniel Craig could not pull it off, but he has and with style and a cold steel edge, not seen since Sean Connery. This is proper action hero stuff, but he actually looks like if he wanted to he could kill you. With an opening sequence that will stop you from blinking for 20 minutes. The film is class, from the cinematography, to the three dimensional villains, and Bond's rapid learning curve. At last we have another true Bond.. Sharp, sophisticated and as tough as nails... And perhaps correctly more shaken than stirred. Welcome back 007... Welcome back.",positive
I like all movies about James Bond! :P,positive
"Didn't like this the first time because change is always difficult, but after watching a second time I accepted Daniel Craig as James Bond",negative
"This was a 100times better than any of the bond films with Brosnan in. Realistic and Gritty everything a James Bond film should be, no crappy Gadgets, dodgy one liners or comic book Characters, superb ending and great action.",positive
This is one hell of a franchise reboot! Craig is excellent as Bond and Eva Green is even better as Vesper Lynd. Can't wait to see where Bond goes from here.,positive
http://cineptimoarte.blogspot.mx/,positive
"""James Bond will return?"" Not this time. James Bond is here. One may prefer the ""shaken-not-stirred"" Bond, at first. But Daniel Craig truly delivers, in what is the closest thing to Ian Fleming's vision. A solid story is told, focusing on Bond's actual career--counterterrorism and espionage. Bond's image never takes a back seat to the reason we are watching. The free world depends on Bond's success, and with all due respect to Sean Connery, nobody does it better than Daniel Craig. What a debut!",positive
This one's a breakthrough. Showing a little different side of Bond. One of my favorite Bond movies so far,positive
Best Bond since Sean Connery!,positive
"After the terrible Pierce Brosnan movies, Bond is back better then ever. Casino Royale reboots the franchise into a more realistic approach without all the CGI gadgets the previous movies made the mistake of making. Going back to the original dynamic of the 1960 Connery movies, Daniel Craig gives a fantastic performance as the famous secret agent which makes you remember why you fell in love with the movies. Going back to an original story by author Ian Fleming, Casino Royale tells the story of how Bond became Bond and introduces many of the things he does in the other movies. The women he meets, Vesper, has a huge affect on Bond and this movie is full of action and Martin Campbell did a fantastic job bringing back the franchise to the top of the game.",positive
Both Quantum Of Solace And Casino Royale Are The Best Bond Movies Ever!!!!!!!!:P:P:P:P:P:P All The James Bond Movies Are Awsome!!!!:P:P:P:P:P,positive
i don't know why they picked him to be james bond.,negative
One of my favorites. Classic movie with the best Bond yet...Yes...BEST Bond ever.,positive
it is just a very bad wannabe james bod movie daniel craig sucks in this movie like do in Quantum of Solace,negative
Great movie!! Action and Romance!,positive
Awesome!! Nothing like any of the other 007 movies.,positive
"You've got to give Martin Campbell credit; once again he renews the Bond-franchise (just as he did 10 years before with Golden Eye). The new incarnation of Bond is both tougher and rougher, and is a welcome addition to the more slick and sometimes comedian-like Bonds of the past. The film itself is good, but a bit too long to be great in my opinion. If you're a spy-films-fan do NOT miss this one!",negative
More complicated than most 007 movies but still great.,positive
"Reboot on the Bond series and boy did it need it. Just as ridiculous as any Bond has ever aspired to be, only this time it hits the mark in all the right ways. Taking a leaf out of Bourne's book, the thrills and spills hardly let up for a second over the long running time. Exhausting but totally excellent.",positive
restores your faith in bond,positive
"Quite possibly the only James Bond movie I'll ever enjoy. But not only did I enjoy it, I've seen it multiple times.",positive
The best Bond film to date.,positive
one of my all time favourite films,positive
"[center][b][u][font='Cambria','serif']Casino Royale Review[/font][/u][/b] [/center] [font='Times New Roman','serif']Before watching the first of the rebooted James Bond movies, I had only seen (from start to finish) the classic Sean Connery ones. To me, the Roger Moores James Bond seems very misogynistic and rather avuncular while Pierce Brosnan annoys me. George Lazenby will forever be thought of as the 6th Bond whom no one remembers and I cant seem to take Timothy Dalton seriously. [/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']Casino Royale is a genuinely good movie; one thats strong enough to stand without the James Bond mantle it so adroitly carries. This movie has surpassed my admittedly lofty standards and holds a spot on my coveted favourite movies list. An entire wall of my bedroom is devoted to its movies stills. Naturally, half of them are topless Daniel Craig shots.[/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']This brings me to my next subject. Oh, Dan (in my imagination, he has grown fond enough of me to permit this nickname). With his muscular build, piercing blue eyes and knack for acting, how could I fail to loveuh...[i]respect [/i]him. Younger, blonde and [i]actually [/i]English, Daniel Craig plays a stubborn and unpolished James Bond. Fresh after his graduation to double O status, this new Bond is detached and ruthless with an ego to feed. [/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']Eva Green listened to Tom Waits album Closing Time whilst filming as she thought it fit the movies mood. This has nothing to do with the movie but is an interesting tidbit and part of why I like her so much. I might also point out that its a beautiful, moody album. Vesper Lynd is both a complex and developed character. She is intelligent but occasionally overwhelmed; bristly but eventually softens. A far cry from other strictly plaything Bond girls; she is deeply embedded into the plot.[/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif'] Mads Mikkelsen is suitably creepy as the Bond villain; his physical defect front and centre. The character Le Chiffre is soft spoken and undeniably disconcerting. The fact that he is alternatively desperate then nonchalant makes him all the more formidable. [/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']The story plays out in a handful of exotic and elegant locales, with a beautiful musical score. One minute deliciously subtle and moody then exciting and rousing the next.[/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']Having the introduction in black and white enhanced the grisliness of the first kill death scene. The creative transition into the James Bond barrel sequence practically confirmed that I was going to enjoy the rest of the movie and the awesome (and might I add relevant) title sequence exacerbated that excitement. [/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']James Bond chases a man into a government embassy and kills him, blowing most of the embassy to smithereens in the process. The special effects are top-notch and the stunts are well coordinated, executed and filmed. That aerial shot of the two men climbing a really high construction thing undoubtedly made it into all the trailers for the film.[/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']Emerging from the beach in a white bikini = Simple and classic. Riding a white horse along the beach front wearing a lime green bikini while kids chase and look adoringly at you = a tad overdone. This entrance is something that grated me a little; I thought it was somewhat contrived. Daniel Craigs emergence from the water, however, I thought was a highlight of the film. Just because, you know, it adds a lot to the story and he looked like he enjoyed his swim.[/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']This seems as good a time as any to talk about the outfits worn. Daniel Craig looks dashing in the tuxedo that Vesper gets for him but is heart-stoppingly handsome in his navy blue suit at the end of the movie. Also, Miss Lynd is the owner of a few designer outfits that Ive made it my mission to recreate.[/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']On a train, Vesper Lynd sits across from Bond and introduces herself immediately. This is how Bond characters should be announced; not garishly otherwise it seems as if the filmmakers are striving too hard to make it memorable. Although, if this is the only genuine tiff I have with the film, then that says a lot. The verbal sparring between Bond and Vesper is one of my favourite scenes in the movie and her character is soon established to the audience.[/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']I know nothing of card games except fish and snap, so the Casino scenes could easily have grown stale to me. Fortunately, there is enough to keep me hooked: fake bluffs, poisoned drinks and subtle tension music. [/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']My mum doesnt share my enthusiasm for this movie (she dislikes unhappy endings) but her favourite scene is the comforting in the shower. I might add that it was (my good friend) Dans idea for Vesper to be fully clothed instead of wearing just underwear as the script called for. He argued that she would have been too upset to remove her clothes and I love him forever for this. I have nothing against showering in the semi-buff, but he is right; this way its obvious that she is upset and not just lazy.[/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']Now we come to possibly the epitome of the Bond films newly discovered realism: the torture scene. I winced and cracked up during this scene. Le Chiffre is right; there is no need for any elaborate torture scenes, this one is simple, effective and laugh out loud funny. I'm sorry but No! No! A little to the left! is hilarious. [/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']Cue the escape and the recovery scene that seemingly takes place in a picturesque villa. Anyway, here is where Vesper reveals her feelings for Bond and vice versa. Now, I would describe myself as a romantic but the dialogue was a [i]little [/i]sappy for my standards; not to mention Bond standards. However, I guess its necessary to indicate genuine feelings between them. James Bond ostensibly enjoys it so much that he decides to hang up his Bond suit and Vesper and he bill and coo at each other in various other picturesque places. Im just kidding, the romance is nicely done and the two stars have chemistry to make it believable. [/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']The End. [/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']Not. Vesper spots some guy who looks weird (no such thing as a normal looking bad guy) and scowls, so shes like evil, now. Once Bond discovers this, he follows her red, dark-haired figure through the crowd (a throwback to a previous Bond) and interrupts Vesper handing over the silver briefcase of money. A nail gun fight ensues.[/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']Vespers death scene is poignant; very much Death in Venice. I like that she kisses his hands (like he did in the shower) to resolve him of guilt and he tries to save her, despite her betrayal. (Im not sappy; Im a 16 year old girl) Incidentally, when I die, I want to be trapped in an elevator wearing a pretty red dress while Daniel Craig valiantly attempts to rescue me. If only I could find some way of not dying, we could live happily ever afterbut I digress.[/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif'] The now elegiac Vesper theme plays while Bond mourns and I can hear the lapping water in my head as I write this; an example of memorable filmmaking. Note to self: Dans eyes are that much bluer when upset. [/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']A grieving Bond calls M and utters a line that Im glad the producers staunchly defended. The bitch is dead. Yet another reminder that this is no light-hearted romp of a film.[/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']The last scene involves a foot being shot, Dan in his lovely blue suit and his embittered delivery of that oft repeated line:[/font] [font='Times New Roman','serif']The names BondJames Bond. Cue the classic music. See, makers of Quantum of Solace? (Dont deny that youre not avidly reading this) Thats how you end a film;[i] that[/i] is a fitting prelude to the infamous Bond theme. [/font]",positive
BOND *gets* BRUTAL! And I love the opening song by Soundgarden/ Temple of the Dog front man Chris Cornell.,positive
MMMMM... Eva Green..... Ahhh to be Mr. Bond.... Will watch this film anytime it's on TV or just anytime... Has the best Through the Gun Barrel sequence out of all the bond films...,positive
Love this bond movie,positive
Best foot chase I've ever seen.,negative
"I'm not a fan of the James Bond's pictures, but I enjoyed watching this movie. It's not one my favourite movies, but it's not bad.",negative
"its a 2nd Bond Movie that i have seen After ""Die Another Day"" i like New James Bond, and also Eva Green, some scenes done very beautifully. like first chase scene, after, when Villon beat da Bond, and obviously Action are a part of BOND Movies",positive
"Witness the rebirth of James Bond. This absolute classic film takes us to the origins of 007, and gives us our first 'bad-ass' Bond, charmer and killer. Daniel Craig is the best Bond of the series and really puts a dose of reality",positive

Daniel Craig is the best Bond of the series and really puts a dose of reality into a franchise that had seen much better days. But this on, and prepare to be stunned!",positive
Daniel Craig is the best bond since Sean Connery!,positive
Very good remake. Great song by Chris Cornell - cool sound and great lyrics for a Bond song. Loved the opening sequence - very cool and stylish. Great adaptation of the Bond character - I am excited about Bond for the first time in my life.,positive
The James Bond we have all been waiting for..,positive
Best Bond since Golden Eye.,positive
"I'm flushed! Daniel Craig's Bond is more brutal (and sexier) than previous Bonds. The action is also better than in previous films. And, more importantly, the story also has that human dimension which was lacking in previous films. A successful reboot!",positive
This is the first Bond movie that I have seen. It is a very entertaining movie but honestly not my type of movie,negative
I lov james bond movie!,positive
good first new bond movie,positive
"Interesting, but didn't grab me the way I thought it would.",negative
"I liked Quantum of Solace much better.... But I wouldn't know, I'm not really a bond-person",negative
I just don't see the attraction with Daniel Craig as Bond. Sean Connery was so much better,negative
"This movie is almost everything that good about Bond! You get the kick-ass agent, along with the charmer that is 007. There seemed to be a lack of gadgets in this one, so that took the edge off a little. Overall quite impressive stuff here. Add this DVD to your collection.",positive
"Best. Bond. Ever. Apologies, but not sorry Mr. Connery. I will go drink my VESPER now. If I could only find that ellusive Kina Lillet ...",positive
"amazing way to reboot the franchise! this is the funniest, most gripping bond film ever made.",positive
"Good stuff, the original plot combined with solid acting by the main parts lead to a good movie.",positive
This movie is fantastic! The fight scenes were amazing. The action and romance worked well together. Made me cry at some parts...such a twist to the end. This James Bond is HOT!,positive
An excellent performace from Daniel Craig as Bond. This new take on Bond is best thing that has a happended to the franchise. This is not just a great bond movie but it's a great film.,positive
"Daniel Craig is a great new step for Bond movies. The direction is much more serious and while I miss Q, this is a great movie.",positive
"A un Bond biondo non avrei dato un penny. E invece questo Ã¨ il miglior 007 degli ultimi anni. Asciutto e intelligente nei dialoghi, tiratissimo nel ritmo e accattivante nella fotografia.",positive
ohhhhhh!! daniel craig uuuuummmmmmyyyyyyy! gah!,negative
"Lo ammetto: non ho mai amato i film su James Bond, troppo affettati e snob. Con ""Casino Royale"" invece viene mostrata la nascita cruda dell'agente piu' famoso del mondo, a partire dal suggestivo flashback iniziale in bianco e nero che sfuma verso una spettacolare e incredibile corsa a ostacoli. L'azione si sposta al dramma, si inframezza all'autobiografismo (la lunga partita di poker), e infine al sentimentalismo: la parte finale del film e' tutta dedicata ai movimenti del cuore... Assolutamente di culto per suggestione e fascinazione la sigla dei titoli di testa (vale da sola un film!).",positive
pretty much the perfect thriller especially the torture scene,positive
As good as Sean Connery in his prime.,positive
Great one! Best one so far and Daniel Craig...oh my!!!,positive
its gd if u like action but werent for me...,negative
I don't like Daniel Craig as James Bond. He looks like a villain.,negative
I was so done with Bond and didn't even want to see this. I was certainly surprised.,negative
i love all the actions in this movie! all the fights and fought. craig is so hot.,positive
Besta James nÃ¥gonsin (hitils)...Nya Bond Ã¤r vÃ¤lspelad och inte tÃ¶ntig.,positive
"YES!!! I am a dedicated Sean Connery as Bond fan, and I even like the Roger Moore ones, but for 20 years we suffered through Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan sucking it up. Blech. This one goes in yet a third direction. It's not the cheesey 1960s Bond (which I love, despite cheese) and it's not the more action-packed, yet still somehow boring 1980s and 1990s Bonds. It's a Bond for today. Yes, it's still a spy movie with insanely cool gadgets and spy gear, but the writing and the action suit today's audience. We actually get character development this time around. SPOILER ALERT: We see Bond love and lose, possibly explaining his hard-hearted womanizing in the future. SEE this movie!",positive
"I am one of those very few people who are not into the James bond Series, especially the ones with Pearce Brosnan as 007. But Daniel Craig does a great job as bond and I really enjoyed this movie",negative
"The first time I watched this movie, I liked it so much I watched it again immediately after. This is the first 007 movie I've been able to stomach.",positive
I think this is the best Bond ever,positive
what bond should be and far better that the Quantum of Solace,positive
I own it and have watched it like 100 times,positive
"I love strong characters, but I couldn't find myself rooting for the poor guy. I want to be at the edge of my seat, but maybe that is why he is a good agent. People can't read what he is thinking. Sadly, even when he was all lovey dovey, I didn't know if I believed him or not. I like the actors, but sadly, their characters weren't strong enough for my liking.",negative
Making Bond bad ass again. The only thing that hurts this Bond isn't bullets it's the Lord of The Rings like ending (super extended). If you are looking for more Eva Green check out The Dreamers.,positive
"This is my first James Bond film so I can't compare Craig to Pierce Brosnan's or Sean Connery's James Bond. I thought he gave a strong, convincing performance. Great movie with plenty of excitement and suspense! Can't wait to see Quantum.",positive
It was a great movie!,positive
Daniel Craig - even yummier in blu-ray,positive
"I have only seen a few James Bond movies, but this has to be one of the best.",positive
"Exploitive, even for Hollywood standards. Viewers will find a healthy dosage of fast cars, explosions, chase scenes, attractive women, and enough guns to shake a stick at. Nonetheless, its a fresh take on the Bond franchise. Multiple villains conspiring in the shadows will keep you on the edge of your seat and ask, ""Who's the ringleader here?"". However, some of the cuts during dialogue driven scenes seemed longer than they needed to be, forcing me to laugh when I wasn't suppose to. Overall its a ride filled with unexpected turns because Bond sleeps with more people than he kills.",negative
Great flick. Had to watch this one again.,positive
Best. Bond. Ever. One of the few films I could watch 24/7.,positive
"sexy blue eyes. sexy supporting actress (hot purple dress and eye makeup). and what a fantastic, typical Bond villan.",positive
"I avoided this when it first came out because I just could not bring myself to approve of the new gritty Bond. Having watched it though, it really was not as bad as I was expecting. If I thought of it as a non-Bond movie, it was actually quite good. I just can't accept this gruff, realistic take on Bond though.",negative
"It took me awhile to come around to Daniel Craig as Bond but definitely love the new Felix, M is always fabulous with Judi, and plus it has Sir Richard Branson in it for a cameo",positive
Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"Exellent, real dark for Bond",positive
wow! is that james bond or what!! i'm totally blown away!,positive
I do not like Daniel Craig as the new James Bond at all.,negative
loved it. wife loved daniel.,positive
Bond dah makin tk best !!!!,negative
The Best James Bond Movie.,positive
This is my first bond movie so I don't have anything to compare them to. I thought this one was pretty good though. From what I've always heard about Bond though I was a little taken back by the whole mushy love part.,positive
"Basically, this film is CLASS! My opinion: As years went by James Bond was stuggling to keep his title as The World's Greatest Secret Agent. It seemed that 007 would get his arse kicked serverly if he was to ever come against Ethan Hunt or Jason Bourne. But now the 'cheesy, fist fighting 007' has GONE! Daniel Craig = ULTIMATE KILLING MACHINE! This is the best 007 film yet! Casino Royale is the only James Bond film to be anything like the actual books. More action, better cast, more realistic and darker James Bond. The film shows more of James Bond's character, we see deeper into James Bonds heart. People who have complained about this film must have fallen in love with the classic 'cheesy' James Bond. If you read the books, you'll see that Daniel Craig fits the part more than any of the other actors. GREAT FILM! Beats any Mission Impossible, Bourne or previous Bond film.",positive
"Overall it was good, but I can't get over the fact that he didn't really have any significant gadgets besides the defibrillator... It just didn't quite feel like James Bond!",negative
"Craig acquits himself well in this thoroughly enjoyable, superbly directed Bond flick, although it drags a bit in the third act. Craig is excellent in his first outing as Bond, nailing the dramatic scenes and lending an impressive physicality to the action scenes. Most important of all, the man can run without looking like a girl. The script is based on Ian Fleming's first Bond novel, previously only filmed as a spoof. This allows for some intriguing character development, lending the plot some valuable dramatic weight. The only problem is that the action tails off around two thirds of the way through the film, leading to a finale that is less than rousing, despite its imaginative setting. Similarly, as exciting as the poker game is, it was probably a mistake to have everyone sitting down for 25 minutes of the film. The action scenes are terrific, particularly the jaw-dropping opening chase scene, in which Bond squares off against a free-running bombmaker (Sebastien Foucan). In addition, Green brings an alluring intelligence and vulnerability to the Bond Girl role, and there's strong support from Judi Dench (deliciously spiky as ever), Caterina Murino (as the other Bond girl) and a superbly cast Mads Mikkelsen. It drags a bit towards the end and is slightly too long, but Casino Royale is still a thoroughly enjoyable Bond film and Craig is a welcome addition to the franchise.",negative
"False endings galore!! Epic in length, but still one of the better films.",positive
despite the critics.....goood movie,positive
"I hated this when I first watched it, and I liked it better upon a second viewing. It's a decent action flick, but a poor James Bond flick. I don't need to see the James Bond Texas Hold 'Em Poker Tournament for two hours, which is essentially what this movie was. And if you're going to reduce the gadgets in a James Bond flick, that's fine, just don't make your top-of-the line gadget a defibrillator in the glove box of an Aston Martin. WTF? Does he have a blood sugar tester in the headlight switch of the car, too? Stupid, stupid, stupid. The whole deal of Bond developing feelings for a woman, too....what? I don't want an emo James Bond. Again, not bad, if you just want to watch Daniel Craig in a decent slow-burning spy flick. Piss poor for a Bond Flick.",negative
"Good movie. Daniel Craig is a great Bond, and shows the less invincible bond and transitions to a more action orientated film.",positive
I didn't realize how good this was until I saw Quantum of Solace,positive
"People didn't lke this because it was different to all the other Bond movies, but it's still a good film. Drags on a bit though.",positive
Not only the best Bond film but a rattling good thriller and the film that is truest to the source.,positive
One of the best Bond movies ever! Daniel Craig and Mads Mikkelsen are both very good as Bond/Le Chiffre.,positive
My personal favorite James Bond film.,positive
"wow the best yet of the modern bond era, well since Roger Moore anywayz lol makes me seem old/am old iknow but they have gone up and down in quality these days. Taking no attention away from this picture particularly being fantastic and although a bit rougher (excessive hand 2hand combat) displays the true darker side to a hired killer. great intro to his unpersonal employment factors (explains mmMoneyPenny inuendos) effortlessly glamorous but as unrealistically sultry as a porn is to romantic realism. good effectsnot over the top except some stunts and the defiblerator gimmic (everyone knows the dangers involved with a defib. for mainstream use). The modern twists and tech, to the directors credit are copeable for this classic, making viewing a pleasure with a support cast and female lead to die for maybe another too. Daniel Craig gets the thumbs up even though a bit brawnie for this charater/gernre. The ending did make for a longer motion picture in total, though is an important factor of any tale that can use such as an epilog to both introduce a series and set the standards if the viewer is a thinker of any caliber, to come away from the screen/ing.",positive
Un des meilleurs James Bond,positive
"Good action and a good story. Looking forward to seeing, ""Quantum of Solace.""",positive
Now I understand why everyone loved this movie. I now have a James Bond fetish!,positive
"Finally, no rediculously outlandish fight scenes and sexist names for women (except in a little quip). This movies follows the Bond pattern, but in a good way and was enjoyable to watch. Too bad they did not have this type of writing for Pierce Brosnan because he was a truly awesome Bond actor.",positive
the only thing i real liked was the car. i could use one like that :),negative
"Genial Daniel Craig, no tenia pinta de hacerlo bien pero no esta nada mal. La Eva Green guapisima. Mucha accion como siempre, tapuda pero entretenida.",negative
"daniel craig is really hot, but the movie is just too much of 'running'",negative
A bond movie with a rougher edge than usual. The characters are more indepth in particular bond himself is far more human in this guise as the semi-sociopathic spy/assasin hiding behind a flawed mask of civility and composure. The general story is more muted than previous films with a lack of supervillian style personas and bond gadgetry but this fits well with the new realism of the film compared to its predecessors. An enjoyable film.,negative
"This was probably in the top two of bond movies, however, they could have chosen someone a little more suitable for the part. Daniel Craig is a good actor, but he does not look like the charming, sophisticated Bond like the character has always been. Craig is actually scary looking! While I think that Pierce Brosnan will always be the best Bond, this one was still an excellent movie, minus the rediculous sequel that followed it.",positive
"I'll be honest in that I have never really been into James Bond and I wasn't even going to bother watching this until I was lent it. And boy am i glad I watched it! I was fixed to the screen throughout. Its so different to the other Bonds I have seen. At one point I actually shouted at the TV screen during Bonds car chase! You'll understand which part when you watch it. I wasn;t to keen on Daniel Craig being James Bond for soem reason, but after seeing him in this he is brilliant! The perfect James Bond. Great action scenes in the movie. The begininng sets it all of. I can't wait to see Quatum of Solace now. Really impresssed with this, if your not a Bond fan I am sure you will be after seeing this movie.",positive
"I didnt think i'd like the new james bond,but mr craig was superb,,",positive
James Bond movies I have not seen a bad one yet!,positive
"Bond as the cold-hearted professional killer, with marvellous action, great music and a razor-sharp downparing of what we percieve to be James Bondesque.",negative
Great Bond movie but I was bothered by all the timeline errors.,positive
"I wasn't really sure about Daniel Craig. I mean a blue eyed, blonde haired James Bond? But he pulls off the confidence and bravado (once you can get passed his ""ducky"" pout). I prefer bond with the touch of realism he has here",negative
"I'm not really a huge fan of the Bond movies. To me they've always felt a little to formulaic for my taste. Casino Royale adheres to the same blueprint as the previous movies. You've got your bond girl, your eccentric villain, your sinister plot...yet it all comes together in the form of a Bond movie that feels unique and exciting.",negative
"Yes, okaaay, it was good. Fine. I still don't like James Bond.",positive
"At first, I was hesitant to see this film as I am not a huge fan of reboots. But, this film really established the Bond character much more accurately as to what he was in the books. And Eva Green absolutely nails Vesper...it was perfect all the way around!",positive
"Best Bond move since A View to a Kill. And it's based on one of the two Ian Flemming novels I have actually read,",positive
"LOVED it casting Craig for this film was genius, more gritty than any Bond to date, but ought not to deviate too far from a winning recipe for future Bond films, as a one off this was brilliant. Not a bench mark for future Bond though!",positive
"I am a huge 007 fan, and I would like to be put on the record saying that this is the single greatest Bond film ever.",positive
"I am a huge 007 fan, and I would like to be put on the record saying that this is the single greatest Bond film ever.",positive

ahhhh... stupid love and ass kicking. This is a perfect action flick.,positive
One of the best Bond movies,positive
"OK ? I?m a James Bond fan. So, right off the bat I?ll say I was leery. Leery of a blonde Bond. Leery about a relatively unknown actor jumping into the timeless role. Leery of an actor who might be a little too ?hard? looking to play the über spy. But, enough of my fears?since this film and Daniel Craig?s performance put them all to rest, I will no longer focus on my apprehensions. What I will focus on is that this is a strong film in a series that has been through some hard times in the past?especially concerning actor changes. I will also focus on the fact that Craig makes a strong, determined Bond?different than all the others but made for the 21st Century. Could Connery be Bond today? Probably not. He would slap the wrong woman?s bottom and she?d sue him. Would Roger Moore? Well, no, because his series of quips would also land him in court for one thing or another. Pierce Brosnan was the perfect end-of-the-20th-Century Bond?debonair, striking, yet with a soft side. In Casino Royale, the 21st installment of the official Bond films (not counting 1983?s Never Say Never Again and 1967?s Bond spoof also based and titled on Ian Fleming?s first Bond novel, Casino Royale), Craig holds onto Bond?s soft side right up to the very end. His Bond is raw and harsh and more ?action? and less ""sophistication"" than his predecessors. The plot is pretty simple, which is another departure from most of the recent Bond films that get mulled down with convoluted stories. Here, Bond needs to win a high-stakes poker game so a terrorist does not win money to finance his crimes. This film also goes back to the beginning of 007?s career?right after he has been granted his license to kill by Her Majesty?s Secret Service (this makes sense since this is the novel Fleming used to introduce the world to Bond). And, granted, the film could use a little editing (it is close to 2 ½ hours long) especially around the card game. But, what the film doesn?t need is another Bond search. The right actor has been found! And we can only hope that he sticks around for a while.",positive
A great Bond adventure!,positive
Best Bond movie ever!,positive
Bond is back! Ian Fleming novels are one of my guilty pleasures. Daniel Craig does justice to the bring back the original character of Bond.,positive
"The worst Bond i've seen. That's maybe because i haven't seen Quantum Solage yet. This is too much like any action movie, no more that unique bondish touch. I toss it to category ""what-ever""",negative
"like another movie makeover, ""batman begins,"" daniel craig takes the role of one our most beloved movie franchises with a definite shake, not a stir. rivaling even classic sean connery, our new 007 is played with grit and cleverness, forgoing the sham-wow gadgetry and corniness of his predecessors, and opting for a more ""realistic"" approach.",positive
"Contrary to pre-release nay-sayers, Daniel Craig has done more with James Bond in one film than some previous stars have in multiple reprises. This is terrific stuff, again positioning 007 as the action franchise to beat.",positive
Loved it! James Bond is back and he is alive and well. Exquisite action and explosive emotion!,positive
Bond is well and truely back great flick,positive

Craig charmed me (does Brent hand motion).......enjoyed it alot,positive
"What more can I say? It's a James Bond movie. Nothing too out of the ordinary there, except that we see a more primal, less refined Bond as this describes the start of his career as 007.",negative
"Shame that the new Bond abberates from what a true Bond (Brosnan) should be. Nevertheless, a great film that is truly better than The World is Not Enough!",positive
Best Bond movie EVER!,positive
"Being a lifelong fan of Bond growing up, I was just about to close the door on the franchise until Daniel Craig emerged and shed new light on the classic character. I love the new direction th franchise is going in.",positive
Best Bond film of all time,positive
James BOND is the TRUTH in this movie. This movie made him three tiems as cool as any brosnan film.,positive
"Oh, yes. Daniel Craig CAN play Bond. And, oh Yes. He's excellent as him. This is by far one of the greater Bond movies. It's simply so great; and so much fun to watch. The action, the cinematography, the opening title sequence, the gunbarrel, the card game, the final brawl - it's all here! Do yourself the pleasure and see it as soon as you can. ;)",positive
"The first 30 minutes or so are excellent, as far as action and cinematography go. I was very impressed by the construction fight scene. However, the screenplay begins to suffer and drag after that. This isn't horrible; the film does have its moments, and they are found within the action sequences.",negative
Daniel Craig= Bests bond ever,negative
"I absolutely loved this movie! I saw Quantum of Solace, too - but I think this one is better. Love Daniel Craig as Bond. Love M's dry humor. This one is a must see!",positive

"To be honest. It's not James Bond anymore. I did like it, it's just not Bond. It's too.. brutal. Too much fighting.",negative
"Probobly one of the best james bond movies out there. If you havnt already seen this movie you have to check it out. Casino royale stared Daniel Craig and might I say when I first heard this I thought: ""Just a little off the top, keep the side burns"" and laughed (a kid in king whatever's court). But honestly he is the best James Bond of all time and who can blame in for being in one of the worst movies of all time? this movie sufers from SCD!!!!!!! (Shaky Camera disorder) which P***** me off becuase I just want to know whats going on in a scene and everything is shaking like crazy. 10/10 - 1 for SCD + 1 for Daniel Craig doing a great job as James Bond",positive
Loved it!! I like this Bond better than any of the others!,positive
"Yes I agree that this is among the best in the whole franchise and is exactly how Bond will work for the future, however I can't help but feel that they are generalizing him too much. Nonetheless the movie contains one of the best stories in the whole franchise, highlighting Bond attaining double-o status at the beginning, the intense poker scenes, and the rather tragic ending, showing exactly why Bond can't love anyone. So while stripping Bond of a quarter of what has made him an icon (Q, Moneypenny etc.) has upsetted plenty of fans, it seems they are trying to return to what made Bond so great originally. Let's not forget that Dr. No had absolutely no gadgets whatsoever and yet still manages to be a benchmark for more to come. The franchise reboot that is Casino Royale has already resulted in the stellar Quantum of Solace (a good step in reestablishing Bond to where he has been the past 50 or so years). Craig's performance is what truly bring's Bond's character alive. While I don't think he compares to Connery, Dalton or even Moore, he establishes himself as the man every other guy wants to be, and thus is as sucessful as anyone before him",positive
Simply the best Bond movie ever!!!,positive
"A decent modern bond adaptation where Craig plays the titular hero rather well. The updates to the story work well, but there are some bits of the old Moore-esque hilarity creeping in.",positive
"I know I'm being a little hard with my rating here, but here's why. This film has the title of the first James Bond novel, which I have read a while ago, and although there are some (fictive) facts that are faithfull to the novel in the film, many other (fictive) facts have been altered, changed, or omitted. This movie adaptation is only loosely based on the novel. But this is hardly a fault, many films that are great films, do this. The James Bond character portrayed here by Daniel Craig, seems to fit closely enough, the James Bond from the original novels of Ian Fleming. Craig definitely gives a great performance, with some depth, and on top of that he knows how to fight, unlike the previous Pierce Brosnan. His James Bond, is believable and captivating, the only thing I would change on him, would be for him to lose some weight, and stop pumping heavy weights, he looks a little too pumped-up. James Bond in the novels had a naturally built body, but I must admit I prefer the pumped-up Craig, to the unimposing Brosnan. This action film has spectacular stunts, great fights, and action sequences. The locations and settings are great, and the photography is decent. The torture scene is quite good. The fights are good, but I think the super fast editing is what makes these fight scenes so stunning, this is top-notch editing. The script is inventive and original, and Eva Green gives a remarkable performance, but Craig is the one who gives the most outstanding performance. Judi Dench as M is always fun to watch trying to patronize Bond. Now for the faults of this film, here is what I think. The classic pre-title sequence that the Bond films are so famous for, here it is barely teasing, it's got some style I admit, but lacks a bigger than life setting, and is too short to really give us a taste of what's coming. Yet this is mildly disappointing. What's very disappointing is, the opening credits, their design, colors, style, motifs, are all dull, and this contrasts sharply with the rest of the film, which is far from being dull. The James Bond films used to have fantastic opening credit sequences, but now it seems every new James Bond film gets worse in this department. And the song accompanying this opening credit sequence is almost just as dull as the visuals. This taints the film right at the beginning, with a dullness. Fortunately the ensuing spectacular action sequences, shows us that this James Bond film hasn't lost it's flair for superb action. The story in itself, not from the novel, but from this adaptation is not very strong, although there are some nice touches, it lacks the flair of the novel. And the soundtrack is just your average latter days James Bond film soundtrack, nothing new here, other than a little less electronic sounding, and more real orchestral sounds. Overall, it's not a bad James Bond movie, and better than the Brosnan films in my opinion, mainly because Craig is believable as James Bond, and Brosnan is not.",negative
Couldn't get into it :| I can't stand this filthy Bond,negative
My name's Bond.. JAMES BOND. :D Thumbs up!,negative
"The best Bond movie in my opinion. Put a new spin on Bond, making him more ruggid, kick ass and realistic. Daniel Craig was an excellent choice and Texas Hold Em was an excellent choice with its popularity. One I could watch over and over.",positive
"Better than Quantum of Solace, which was essentially a cheap version of a Bourne movie. Bond's b*tch gets killed, which is great, because we can look forward to his ruthless, ""I'm playing Splinter Cell non-covertly"" handling of his job. Mr. Craig is the least pussy out of all the Bonds...",positive
Best James Bond ever.,positive
"defines a new alpha male, a new James Bond. it's not a classic Bond, but still so full of style.",positive
"Since reading the books, I hadn't been able to watch a Bond movie all the way through. The gadgets, the lame innuendo, the cosiness of the franchise just grated on me. This was brilliant: a genuine reimagining of Fleming, updating the story without losing any of its edginess and brutality. Craig isn't the Bond of the books (too common for one thing), but he's far nearer in spirit than any of his predecessors. Best of all, they finally gave Judi Dench some lines worth saying - about bloody time!",positive
"poker drags this movie down a little.... one liners in this movie are acutally fairly good. The movie sort of used all all the good action sequences before the climax, which is a bit of a miss. Eva Green is as seductive as she's good at being a mysterious bond girl, and Daniel Craig is more lethal than he's smooth, which is fine by me. the romance definitely add some depth to the film.",positive
One of the best Bond movies yet.,positive
Love it Loved it loved his pecs....,positive
I absolutely love this film - and not just because he is so gooooorgeous!!,positive
One of the best Bonds only 2nd to Connery,positive
"8.5/10 Casino Royale is a successful reboot of the James Bond franchise. Stripping away the the more outlandish aspects of the series, it is more character-oriented and realistic than many 007 outings.",positive
"Yummy Daniel Craig, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm",negative
own it and that IS not what I do,positive
A more brutal Bond than ever before. Still not sure if I find that disturbing ...or exciting.,positive
love the film and i love Daniel Craig too!!! (fit),positive
My favorite James Bond film. Hands down.,positive
Better than I thought!,positive
One of the best Bond films.,positive
The best Bond movie of the new millenium and Daniel Craig takes James Bond to a higher level.,positive
"I enjoyed the movie enough to give Daniel Craig a chance as James Bond (frankly, I had not been open to the notion of his replacing Sir Sean Connery). It's a pretty sharp movie, although I consider the opening black and white imagery to be a gimmick. I am giving this movie an extra 0.5 star because the Vesper Lynd character, Eva Green, is so compelling.",negative
Where are the freakin gadgets?,negative
I gotta thank my buddy Richard for lending me this movie. My fiancee and I watched it and loved it. It's definitely a step up from the usual Bond movie. I was glad to see that there was a good storyline to it and that it wasn't all about the kicking of butt or of blowing up things. This one is definitely better than Die Hard 4!,positive
"Such a great movie, I love Daniel Craig as Bond. This movie is not only full of action that will wow you, but also has a lot of heart, and a meaningful love story.",positive
form e the best bond movie and the best 007!,positive
daniel craig is simply pathetic and i think he just doesn't fit in 007's character,negative
Craig gives Bond a whole new appearance - and i like it!,negative
Way better than I had anticipated.,negative
Should have tried to get Pierce Brosnan back.,negative
the best bond movie. daniel craig does fantastic as the new bond.,positive
Mon meilleur. Pas trop de gadget. Un james Bond comme je les aimes,positive
i was surprised. really liked it,positive
Craig is the best Bond ever...I got little bored with the movie. It seemed to be a endless poker game. If i new how to play poker I may appreciated it more. It was still a good movie.,negative
"In my opinion, this is the real James Bond. Going back to the Basics, Look at Dr. No and From Russia with Love, Connery played a Bond that was cunning, and a fighter. I believe Bond got drowned out, by all the Gadgets and Suave. Granted I am a Bond fan, I enjoy a good Bond Flick as much as the next guy. It was time for a reboot, something fresh, something new. It was getting to the point where all of the movies were getting the same storyline. I'm all about a Bond, who is bad ass. Although, I would like to see John Cleese, reappear as Q.",positive
This is what Bond is supposed to be.,positive
"Well done film. At first, I was a little apprehensive with Daniel Craig taking over the shoes of Pierce Brosnan, but he did a good job. After seeing this film, I have to say that he has certainly prooved us wrong about being a bad 007, but his looks are something I'm still trying to get used to. The movie is filled with specatular sceney, great characters and just an awesome plot thanks to it being originally written by James Bond creator Ian Fleming. The downsides to the film, is there aren't that many gadgets in it and Q is no where to be found. But it's good to have Dench back as M.",positive
"Fremragende Bond-film. Meget mere rÃ¥ og kompromislÃ¸s end de forfÃ¦rdelige Brosnan-udgaver. Dette er beviset paa, at man ikke behÃ¸ver at synke sÃ¥ lavt som til platte og overgearede jokes og overflÃ¸digt bond-udstyr for at skabe en dragende fortÃ¦lling. Craig er fuldt paa hÃ¸jde med Dalton og Connery.",positive
"Jusqu'à la mort du Chiffre, c'est du très très grand Bond mais la fin, avec la romance et la maison qui coule à venise, gâche un peu ce reboot moderne de la plus vieille franchise du cinéma.",positive
Amazing like the bruteal parts,positive
Holy shit! Bond is BACK!!! I wasn't expecting this at ALL!,positive
I thought this was fun. It has style. I definitely like the new Bond better.,negative
"Who knew a 007 ""origin story"" would work so well? Daniel Craig makes an amazing James Bond, with surprising vulnerability.",positive
best out of the bond series,positive
"Was looking forward to Clive Owen as the new 007, but after seeing this, Daniel Craig was a fantastic choice. Runs a bit long, and the ending is a little anti-climactic, but the performances are worth watching. Rebooting the franchise was a good move. According to Ian Fleming, Bond isn't supposed to be a Brosnan-style pretty boy. Craig's mug speaks to this, IMO.",negative
"007 re-invented... Somehow strange too... Almost found it hard to believe that i was watching a Bond movie... But it works, it definitely works... And Craig is a top Bond, tough AND vulnerable... Excellent!",positive
"Let me just say, that as far as Bond's go, Daniel Craig is my favorite by far. Part of it is that this is his ""rookie"" double 0 mission. No gadgets and gimmicks, just brute force and cunning. I also like the shift back to more of a detached, unemotional Bond. The beginning foot-chase scene is unbellievable - the way they captured it on film is amazing. Watching Bond learn how he likes his martinis...brilliant. Bond has to learn that having a license to kill doesn't mean that he is an assassin. Wow.",positive
The new Bond is truely amazing!,positive
Beat my expectations. Was a great reboot to this franchise despite my negative opinion initially.,positive
A great reboot of the series. Daniel Craig is excellent Check out the live 1954 version starring Barry Nelson,positive
"Met & Exceeded my expectations. GREAT MOVIE. MUCH BETTER than Quantum of Solace, maybe because I watched that one first. I must say....I did not enjoy the torture part. So cruel.. I guess Bond won't be having babies.. I could not get into the sexual scenes right after that part. I don't know how he could do it. lol The love scene was cute. Makes Bond more human. Very interesting and filling movie. Loved it.",positive
"More realistic and brutal than the original arcs of the Bond series, there is something missing in this one. The charm of the the old style Bond films just isn't there. Maybe it's decent as an action movie (at least the parts that the Mythbusters didn't blow away), but it's not good Bond.",negative
needs more bond gadgets,negative
Love Daniel Craig in those bather shorts :D,positive
Fantastic James Bond movie! Daniel Craig is genius in this role. One of my favorite Bond movies ever.,positive
This is a brilliant film. Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond. Action Tension Drama Comedy all in. Another film I watch all the time. 10/10,positive
Only Bond film I have seen... Pretty good.,positive
love it. have it on dvd.,positive
"Way too long for its storyline with too many false endings. The action is cool enough but aside from a nifty parkour scene it's nothing to knock your socks off these days. If they wanted a reboot, the producers could have at least recast M too.",negative
"Easily one of the best Bond movies ever. Craig was magnificent. And, the Bond babes - wow!",positive
"No further evidence of the horrifying dumbing down of the Bond films is required than the fact that in this film Bond is now plays the Coca Cola of card games, Texas Hold 'Em, rather than baccarat, the game specified in Ian Fleming's novel. The filmmakers did this so that average, revolting slob and his piggish wife/girlfriend won't feel alienated and confused by the utterance of French words by people who don't watch reality TV and shop at Walmart. If you listen carefully you can still hear Ian Fleming rolling around in his grave.",negative
Wonderful action film with amazing dialogues and a thrilling story-telling very exciting.,positive
Best Bond film. Makes Roger Moore look like a fruitcake.,positive
"I'm sorry, but this movie just wouldn't end.",negative
i admit that this was the first Bond movie i have ever seen and i was suprised that i actually liked it,negative
Gotta see it.Like the chase part on foot or on car.Who cares.Bond won't quit.,positive
Amazing!!! awesome! brutal!!! one of the best bond movies ever made!,positive
"My favorite bond movie, so far! I thought it was great!",positive
"top movie,awesome action",positive
"Poker is not cinematic. No no, seriously it's not. Two guys squinting at each other is not dramatic. Someone on the sidelines saying ""That's his tell!"" is not good dialogue. All the things that surround the poker are very very good in this film. Characters, stunts, tone, plot all very good. Especially liked Dame Judy in this.",negative
One of the best Bond films ever. Actually giving the character depth! Amazing.,positive
gets a whole lot better once Eva Green enters the picture,positive
watched it twice and still didn't like it.,negative
I can tell by the people who gave two stars and lower have never read the books cause if they had they would have known that is exactly how bond is cold and brutal Daniel Craig is James Bond,positive
The bond film I saw it was very cool.,positive
"Relaunching the Bond franchise was a risky proposition, but this movie really does justice to the Bonds of the past while carving out its own identity. This movie is full of great action right from the beginning, and the free running sequence immediately jumped into the discussion of 'Best Bond Chase Scene'. Daniel Craig does a great job as the new Bond, and presents us with a surprisingly unique take on the character. This movie runs out of gas towards the end, and maybe over-reaches in the middle section. I was hoping for some actual suspense inside the casino during the card game, which I feel was a real missed opportunity for this to become a 'great' Bond movie. The ending kind of left me unsatisfied as well. I think that it was too much to ask the audience to be into the new Bond, new direction, and new everything else, and then throw a relationship to care about on top of all of it. Still, this Bond is well worth watching and is even better on DVD than it was in the theater.",positive
Thank you for brining Bond back.,positive
"Why do I love this film? Well, its a james bond movie. Its got Daniel Craggyface in it with not a lot of kit on - and even when he's got his kit on he's hot. Need I say more?",positive
"When i first saw this, i thought it was crap! I didn't like the black&white beginning, or Eva Green, or the 'typical' baddie', or Craig as Bond, and thought the story was over-long and cinfusing! I've since come to love this film, and not just because it was only Â£7 in Asda when it got released! Its a great story with a good balance of action, humour, and interesting characters (which ALL show emotion!). The gadgets etc, which i used to love in the Bond films, was there, but not in their usual cheesily-predictable fashion. Green's character is mysterious, believeable and interesting, and Bond himself seems more accessible as a person. Giannini's and Dench's role were short but well done as always. Overall, this went from crap, to my favorite Bond film.",positive
well he shows some top end agility.... was quite interesting...,positive
i really don't see what all the fuss is about. maybe people just like that there's poker.,negative
Double-O's are always special...,negative
"Incredible first outing for Daniel Craig in this reboot. One of the best action films of the decade, and perhaps the best Bond film ever.",positive
"Second best movie , never watched any james bond before this.",positive
the most destructive Bond ever. He breaks everything he touches. I like the fact that its a 007 learning what it means to be James Bond,negative
Makes Bond look like Bond.,positive
Finally a good looking J.B.,negative
"Really quite good. Very well acted, well shot, well written, well scored. The only complaint is a slightly-too-long runtime, hampered by slight pacing problems right around the 2 hour mark.",positive
"Arguably my favorite Bond film. It's a good thing Daniel Craig proved himself to be a top-noch actor here, 'cause Quantum of Solace totally sucked his personality away.",positive
"Best Bond film, IMO.",positive
I enjoyed this movie,positive
"a great action packed film, daniel craig fits james bond almost as good as the old guy did.",positive
"It has some amazing sequences, light on the gadgets, and some all-around excitement.",positive
Great james bond but i feel the new style movie is missing the plot of what james bond is.,negative
my favorite Bond flick so far,positive
"Never before have the Bond films been this stylish, gripping, and real. The cinematography is perfect, the pacing just right, and the locations are beautiful to compliment the cinematography. The action is exciting, full of twists and sudden turns. For me, the ideal Bond, with all the neccasary ingridents included, and the cheese, thankfully, taken out. Daniel Craig appears to play the role effortlessly. Hopefully, the series will remain with more installments like this.",positive
This is one of the best Bond films I've ever watched. Craig gave us a new perspective of Bond in this movie.,positive
The best Bond film ever!,positive
good movie. entertaining and has a high tension. different from other bond movies.,negative
Defiantly the best Bond ever!!! Daniel Craig Rocks!!!!,positive
Its a good movie all the action and locations are nice but it might hav been more better coz the bond factor was missing not like the other bond movies.....,positive
"Daniel Craig est un animal! Sans blague, j'ai beaucoup aime ce film, tant l'intrigue que la cinematographie. La scene de torture est incroyablement drole!",positive
A truly great chase scene. Bond is back.,positive
Good action movie but NOT a true Bond!,negative
"Probably the best Bond film since GoldenEye. Great plot, great action, and an overall great movie.",positive
"The best Bond flick since Connery's first two and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, its time to meet a more grittier, violent Bond and good for it. They have kept his humour but binned all the stuff that needed to go. The film has classy cinematography, a decent script and Craig is perfect as Bond",positive
loved it awesome film,positive
"A new Bond, a remake of the old film (or reboot of the franchise) and Daniel Craig lives up the the legacy of great Bond actors. He is amazing in this. The action scenes are fantastic too.",positive
nice action 007 film,positive
intresting and such..........,negative
"madly in love with this movie, and with daniel craig. amazing.",positive
This films just keeps on giving... top notch in all areas. It is my favorite Bond film by a considerable margin.,positive
That was a different way to get information out of someone. YIKES !,positive
"A huge fan of the Bond films, was skeptic about Daniel Craig being the new Bond, since I love Pierce, but he pulled it off. The story was great, filmed beautifully, actors were great, and the action was good and believable. On top of my list ;)",positive
One of the best Bond movie ever. Nice performance by Daniel.,positive
worst Bond movie for a while. Daniel Craig is good. It was just long and wander-y.,negative
Great rebooting of the franchise after they awful Die Another Day,positive
"the one star is for the opening fight sequence across the building site - from that point on i had to really try to watch it all . too much smooching , not enough storyline , average bad guys - shame.",negative
"I tried, but I honestly couldn't finish this movie. Sean Connery is the only James Bond worth watching.",negative
"what happened to the classy 007? I don't want to be a ""Bond Girl"" anymore... this sucks!!!",negative
"Easily one of the best Bond films ever. The action sequences are mind blowing - primarily the construction site chase sequence. Sticks quite closely to the original Fleming novel, and works extremely well as a result. The torture sequence is leg crossingly uncomfortable. Craig is an excellent Bond - tough, but reasonably suave when necessary. He is a killer - exactly what he needs to be. The resetting of the Bond series was a long overdue concept, and the way it is done in Casino Royale, building the theme song through the film, until the final scene when Bond finally introduces himself in the traditional manner, is excellent.",positive
daniel craig beats P{ierece Bronson by a ton.,negative
"Boring and nothing like Pierce Brosnan in my opinion, plus I didn't understand it.",negative
"When this came into theaters back in 2006, I had been a Bond fan for about two years, and clearly not enough to fully appreciate it when I saw it opening day. But on DVD(which I own) I have watched it again and some more, and I think that this is certainly up there with Batman Begins reboot-wise. It had all the action excitement and plot twists that any Bond film should have.",positive
"Best Bond film of all time. I have nothing more to say, other than Daniel Craig is the best Bond in history.",positive
"Not that I am a James Bond buff or anything, but this is in my opinion the best Bond to date. Although I dobuted a blond guy could play James Bond, Daniel Craig masters the cocky austiere of Bond, while still giving it something fresh. The plot is great; although the casino scene can take a bit long, watching his transformation into 00 status is exciting. Watching him put on ""the cocktail jacket"" for the first time is like watching Batman put on the batsuit. Finally, the action scenes and special effects do not take away from the overall film, which in todays movies, is a rarity.",positive
"A few too many almost-endings, and a little too long for a Bond movie, but still fantastic in so many ways, and SOOOO much better than the last couple of Bonds, any flaws are totally forgivable.",positive
This is my all-time favorite Bond. I think Daniel Craig is awesome as the new James Bond. I know others will disagree because most think Sean Connery was the best. I agree that Sean Connery was cool as James Bond. I think Daniel Craig is the toughest. Great movie!,positive
"Daniel Craig's first outing as Bond. Personally, I just don't think he's a good bond; he doesn't look the part, and his on-screen persona isn't really that suave either. Fair enough, this film is set back when Bond was just starting out, so for showing Bond's youthful naivetÃ© I applaud Craig; but I still think he's a bit of a c*nt (same with Christopher Ecclestone, but thats another story). Obviously, 'Bond' is still a character rooted in the 60s, still quite misogynistic and arrogant; still trying to be a cavalier in the 21st Century. The the problems with the franchise don't end there. I'm not going to write a whole essay on 'Bond', but I heard a notable quote recently that one director was offered a Bond film, but he insisted on directorial control, and they wouldn't relinquish, because they are being run by accountants, who insist on a formula that has worked for a dozen movies, so surely must work now. Although I saw Casino Royale not long after it came out, I've just seen the Blu-Ray of it. And although the High Def disk does make it look glossy and focussed, its hard to tell just how much detail would be lost in the DVD. Notably, I also watched The Dark Knight (both are highly reccomended for showcasing Blu-Ray's potential), and TDK displays full-screen in 16:9, while CR still has black bars along the top and bottom. The way they've created a detailed pop-up Title Menu you can see during playback in useful (letting you choose a scene or other option without returning to the start), but its a pity it makes a noise when you open it. I'm also a bit disappointed by the picture-in-picture commentary; in this just two men alone in a small cinema. As anyone who's used Photoshop, Premiere, or any decent image/video editor will know, these things are basically just layers upon layers; so surely they should be able to not only show the little screen, but interact with the action more. So far, I haven't seen the box replaced with any other content; and I'd also like to see them annotating the rest of the screen (""This bloke here, circled"" etc) using an overlay. Anyway, getting back to the actual film, I still find it peculiar that this film is set in the past, but M is still Judy Dench (from the then future). The plot is quite simplistic compared to some; but it does have wide appeal, and its a nice opener to the series. They've already said that Devil May Care won't be the next Bond film, so (after QoS) it remains to be seen what they choose as the next one, and when. Hopefully by then Craig will be long gone.",negative
"Un Bond agressif et qui dÃ (C)pote, faÃ§on tractor pulling ; un reboot efficace de la mythologie bondienne (comment Bond est devenu 007) ; des scÃ¨nes d'action qui dÃ (C)potent, pas trop de gadgets, des personnages travaillÃ (C)s.",positive
Daniel Craig has to be the best James Bond by far!!!,positive
"A fairly stark departure from the previous 007's, but it works. The Bond girls aren't just damsels in distress anymore, and there's this awesome parkour sequence.",positive
What a brilliant new introduction for Bond. I don't care for the Bond series usually. I don't find chauvinism particularly attractive myself *barf* So I was both shocked and pleased to see a Bond that was charming without being demeaning and sensitive to the point of actually falling in love *shock*. He didn't need to sacrifice his sex life (see big boobed girl #1) or his action-packed-save-the-world missions to accomplish this either. I really hope they are able to maintain this balance through the rest of the series.,negative
"Totally Bond, and as a woman, I have to say that, my standard of men increased considerably, OH MY GOD!!! HE IS JAMES BOND FOREVER!!! apart from that, good movie, I gave an extra star just for him.",positive
"Not too bad. Liked it more than ""Quantum"".",positive
"Viihdyttava ja hyvin toteutettu toimintaelokuva. Bond eroaa hahmona taysin aikaisemmista hurmureista, mika onkin pelkastaan positiivista. Juoni on etenkin bond-mittarilla kohtuu jarkeva, mutta olisi tama hieman tiivistysta kaivannut.",positive
Daniel Craig....coming outta the sea....nuff said!,positive
"If it weren't for the love scenes, this movie would be damn near perfect (in the bond sense)",positive
I thought it was okay. I like Daniel Craig.,negative
Surprice surprice this was a FAB bond!,positive
"When they first made the ""announcement"" of who was to be the new Bond- I was a bit skeptical that Daniel Craig could pull it off. He just did not seem the part at all. Plus, I had never heard of him. However, I think that he was perfect for this role. He has a bit of the look of a young Sean Connery- and who can resist that? I did not like the story line too well- it was a bit hard to follow what was going on, and it was very violent, but that is a given for a Bond movie. However, the violence seemed a bit more raw and realistic than other Bond movies. This story line was supposed to set the precedent for a emotionally detached character and they good job of explaining that aspect of his character for his ""future"" adventures.",negative
hot movie YUMMY!!! :),positive
"I actually would have prefered Pierce in this role, that said, this was; GOOD!",positive
The way it should have been dun,positive
Awesome awesome awesome,positive
"I really like Daniel Craig's James Bond, its alot grittier and more like a real movie, and I think this will end up being a very underrated Bond movie",positive
Of of the alltime best bond movies.,positive
he's a perfect match for me !! LMAO,positive
"The Bond movie done right, albeit with a more ruthless Bond.",positive
"So cool to see he plans everything beforehand, so smart. Didn't like the ending though :(",negative
"It's like an origin movie for James Bond, how he became what he was later. It is as good as the critics say.",positive
Easily one of the best James Bond flicks.,positive
It would have been more entertaining haveing four kids play 007 for N64 on the screen for eternity...,negative
"I was like, ""where's James Bond!?"".. Oh There he is.",positive
i love 4 me da best 007!!!,positive
"Ny och bra Bond, men var Ã¤r M?",negative
one of my favorite bond movies,positive
"Probably the best Bond movie I've seen (next to Golden Eye) and I've seen them all. A hard Bond, without being to much hammer. And Eva Green is the best Bond girl ever. She's clever, not psychotic and doesn't runs around nacked like a ****. ; ) Watch this movie! Or get the DVD.",positive
A blonde Bond? *smirk* Daniel Craig gives Sean Connory a run for his money and makes 007 cool for all them kids.,positive
I found this one of the best bond moves. Love the story and its not far fetched or over actiony . . .,negative
"the action is pretty good, especially the chase of the bombmaker at Madagascar. but this James Bond is not agile enough, not well-toned enough. Also, it makes it hardly convincing that Vesper could attract everyone at the casino table. Should have better looking actresses next time.. =p",negative
"Great Bond Story, One of my favorites, Daniel Craig Plays a good bond! Looking forward to watching the Quantum of Solace, eventually.",positive
"So I think this is over-rated. I can dig the whole concept of relaunching the Bond franchise as a more serious series, but I just didn't think the story or the characters held up as well as I'd been led to believe. It definitely got downright dull at times. Still worth watching, of course.",negative
"I'm sure that many would disagree, but I think that this is the best Bond and Bond film ever!! This Bond is aggressive and does what he has to do to get the job done!! Very high intesity!!",positive
"One of the best bond films. Craig's not the best bond ever, but I like him in this. Too bad Quantum isn't this good.",positive
"this movie is awesome and ties with the Dark Knight for my number one movie, Daniel Craig owns as Bond and the plot and action sequences are great",positive
"An excellent Bond movie. The coolest and toughest and real-est Bond, the best Bond girl- Vesper Lynd, a smart plot, huge in scope.",positive
"Didnât feel much like a Bond movie, but pretty good anyways. Except for a couple of stunt filled chase sequences early on, it felt very different than any Bond movie Iâve seen. Most of the characters and situations seemed a lot more realistic. Bondâs toys were nothing over the top; the Bond girls had fairly normal names...no double entendres this time around. Daniel Craig as Bond was much grittier, a bit of a hard ass with the look and some of the charm of Sean Conneryâs Bond.",negative
Was really not knowing what to expect but in the end really enjoyed this reboot of a classic franchise.,positive
"Me encanta! y eso que es la UNICA que de verdad disfrute de la franquicia 007, genial la historia (esta si se trata de algo en verdad) y me encanto la relacion de Bond y Vesper. Divertida e inteligente.",positive
eva green + bourne influence,positive
Yes! For sure the best bond yet...at least since Sean Conery maybe even better. Love Mr. Craigs fashion Style,positive
2 hr movie...but over an hour of it was a poker game,negative
It is far the best Bond movie. 3 of the best actors doing it.(Craig/Dench/MickelssenMe loving them both. Maybe i cannot be so sure of my judgement ...but anyway,positive
Amazing go watch it.,positive
"very gud performance from daniel craig,played the part of bond really well",positive
A great installment that takes the series in a brand new direction (while somehow going back to the beginning),positive
"Re paidia... O Daniel san poion moiazei, san poion moiazei....",positive
Es Muy triste!!!!!! pero muy buena,positive
"After seeing Batman Begins and having it turn me off from the idea of rebooting a franchise, imagine my horror when I found out that James Bond, my favorite movie character of all time, would be doing the same thing. I was almost bracing for the worst, and having Daniel Craig, an actor whom I've never been that impressed with in the past, would be playing Bond, I thought that this movie was going to suck. However, I was proven wrong when I saw this in theaters, and it made me say that James Bond was definitely back. Quantum of Solace is good, too.",positive
"Loved this one.....Daniel makes a great Bond at the start of his career. Some die hards may not like him, but this is the first 007 movie I've taken an interest in for the modern set.",positive
"Daniel Craig is a bastard as Bond, be delicious action.",negative
daniel craig is not the best james bond ever. no.,negative
love the bathing suit!,positive
"Despite some obvious blunders (i.e. being a prequel and yet being 50+ years in the future from the ""first"" film) it was a remarkably watchable film even if Daniel Craig is a political pansy.",positive
Awesome - Daniel Craig shut up the critics.,positive
The best bond's movies so far...,positive
This is not a BOND MOVIE! you ruined it all directors!,negative
Not only the Best Bond Film but many will look back at it in the likes of Dr. No. Perfect.,positive
"Terrific entertainment. It's smart, subtle, and has everything you could want in a Bond film, damn near flawlessly executed. The best action film of the decade.",positive
"In my opinion, the best James-Bond-movie ever! Great story and a fanstastic Daniel Craig. But best of all is Eva Green! If you like her, watch ""The Dreamers"".",positive
"Excellent Bond ""reboot"". The best in years and years. The destruction of the palazzo in Venice was awesome.",positive
"Before watching this movie, I did not like the 007",positive
i haven't seen the other jame bond films alla auti ta spaei,positive
"I have been a fan of the 007 films for a while and I've seen all but two of the films in the series, so when this film was released and appeared to differ pretty drastically from what I was used to I was a bit leery. I couldn't have more wrong, as this is easily my favorite Bond film to date. The studio has given James Bond a reboot, starting the series fresh with a new actor and new tone. The movie starts with Bond receiving his 00-status within MI6 and begins with his first mission as 007. The short version: He has been assigned to a case in which a man known only as Le Chiffre is partaking in a poker tournament in an effort to fund terrorist acts. Of course, that is a major understatement of the plot, as it is MUCH more complex. While most previous Bond film story lines could've been summed up in one sentence (i.e. evil organization/madman attempts to start World War III), this film's plot is complex and keeps you wondering to the end as to who can be trusted. There were some aspects I missed on my first viewing that were made clear the second time around. In addition to the great storytelling, we also get some of the best brutal action scenes from any Bond film. The fist-fights are brutal and the action never goes over-the-top, as it has in the past. We also don't have any of the signature gadgets that Bond fans have become accustomed to (with the exception of some additions to Bond's new Aston Martin). While this all leads to a completely different feel than any of the previous films, I loved it! It is grounded in reality without the campiness that has come to be expected; it seems to have more in common with the Bourne films than the previous Bond films. When I had heard Daniel Craig was to assume the role of Bond in this film, I was not one of the nay-sayers. I had seen him in ""Layer Cake"" and thought he was a perfectly viable option. I was right, because he was fantastic. He was grittier but managed to keep up Bond's usual suave demeanor with a hint of humor. Eva Green is Vesper Lynd, the film's ""Bond Girl"", an agent of the British Treasury sent along to fund Bond's mission in the tournament. She easily qualifies as one of my favorite Bond Girls, both beautiful and talented. The film was also backed with a fine supporting cast as well (Giancarlo Giannini, Mads Mikkelsen, Jeffrey Wright, and, of course, Judi Dench). This film gave the Bond franchise a refreshing reboot that has probably saved it from degenerating into camp-inspired doom. Craig proves himself as a more-than-capable Bond and the film is grounded/realistic for the first time in years. While the movie is longer than most Bond films, it is entertaining throughout and leaves you craving the sequel by the end.",positive
not a james bond film,negative
"""That's because you know what I can do with my little finger,"" Ah what an amazing surprise this movie was. I was one of the Daniel Craig haters, believe it or not. I didn't think he could pull it off. I've basically grown up with James Bond, as dad is a huge fan, and I wanted someone more Sean Conneryish. And even though Sir Sean Connery is the greatest Bond ever in my opinion, Daniel Craig blew me away. He is so much better than the slick pretty-boy Pierce Brosnan. The movie is fantastic. Exciting and oh so charming. The cast is incredible. Daniel Craig, off course. Eva Green as Vesper Lynd. Judi Dench is fabulous as M, as always and Mads Mikkelsen is right up there with the best villains in movie history (which makes me really proud, as he is from one of my neigbour countries).",positive
the action is this movie was totally awesome!,positive
daniel craig is awesome! really liked the plot as well.nice:),positive
Very cool! Highly recommend it for a Bond fan. Craig is great as 007.,positive
Daniel Craig makes a great Bond and this movie was good overall but some scenes were far too long and boring. The chase scene in the beginning is awesome I might add.,negative
this is the Bond that ever boy dreams of becoming when they grow up,positive
realmente muy buena,positive
"I enjoyed that I was able to see this with friends--a bit of chit chat about the film (like laughing about the bikini-clad goddess riding the white horse and being adored by three native children) makes it an enjoyable, not too serious, experience. However, it seems the filmmakers want us to take it seriously, what with the torture and the love story. I'm not convinced it's worthy of that kind of emotional investment. Also, Vesper's motivation does not make sense to me, a big problem, I think.",negative
daniel craig shows how bond should be portrayed.,positive
"The best bond film ever. Daniel Craig isn't the best Bond, he is Bond. Probably one of the best opening sequences of any film, period.",positive
The best James Bond: Daniel Craig!,negative
"Best Bond movie, ever.",positive
"The opening Parkour chase is pretty fantastic, and I love the new characterization of Bond. He's much more real - and thus much more compelling than connery/moore/dalton/Brosnan ever were. Didn't really care for his all too sudden love story - it seemed a bit forced. Not that the two actors didnt showcase a palpable chemistry, the relationship just didnt seem to adequately bloom in the nearly 3 hours they had to work with.",positive
"Full of action that keeps you intended as expected of a Bond movie. Good music, good acting. Daniel Craig definitely doesn't disappoint as a young, hot-headed Bond who still needs some polishing.",positive
"I'm always a bit wary when they try a new guy for a role that's been played by others, but I really thought this was a pretty awesome movie. Craig makes an excellent new bond. I'd really like to see the new one!",positive
not as good as the other bond movies,negative
favorite part: recognizing places in Italy,negative
"I don't know why I keep watching Bond movies; they really aren't as good as they're made out to be. This one, however, beats all of Pierce Brosnan's Bond movies.""",negative
"this was my first-ever bond flick. i enjoyed it quite a bit, yet since said enjoyment came mostly from craig's performance, i don't think i'll be rushing out to watch more bond flicks.",positive
"Great film, Daniel Craig plays it vey good.",positive
The best James Bond yet. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery.,positive
Yeah...freakin sweet...,positive
Finally a gud taking on Bond. The only thing missing now are the gadgets..,negative
"In spite of myself and my first impression of the film (not so good) I decided to watch it again. I WAS WRONG. Stunning action sequences, great visual effects, and Daniel Craig makes James Bond BELIEVABLE. My only criticism of the film was that the pacing seemed to be off at the end. All in all, I loved it!",positive
Wasn't too thrilled about a New Blond Bond but turned out well.,positive
TÃ¤Ã¤ on paras Bondi. EhkÃ¤ mÃ¤ en sit yleisesti kauheesti tykkÃ¤Ã¤ Bondeista.,positive
"Has good action, but the film was too long and boring. How many plots did it have? Hopefully the sequel will be good.",negative
Daniel Craig rocks..,positive
This was a great reinvention of the bond series. Daniel Craig plays the flemming style bond perfectly. Yes the gadgets and one-liners were missing but that isn't and shouldn't be what bond is about. Great work and look forward to more!,positive
I loved it it's the BEST bond film yet,positive
The gratest movie in the world,positive
Pierce who??? Goodbye comedy Bonds. For me the best Bond movie ever,positive
"This movie felt like they tried to make Bond into a more realistic character by removing his gadgets and putting him more in touch with his emotions. Without the gadgets, it just didn't feel like I was watching James Bond.",negative
This movie quite possibly saved the Bond franchise. Gone are the cheesy gadgets and Moneypenny but what remains is the essence of Bond. The Bond franchise has been growing stale over the last several years and the casting of Daniel Craig was a canny move.,positive
One of my fav films with Daneil Craig.,positive
"It's all you could ask for in a Bond movie- fast cars, cool gadgets, and beautiful girl by his side. As usual, Bond gets into a fix and successfully gets out of it. Even if Bond doesn't ultimately have the girl in the end, the whole Bond series could sure use a paradigm shift.",negative
One of the best Bond movies of all time. Reminds you of the earlier Bond films.,positive
finally James Bond is back,positive
". . . Daniel Craig, Daniel Craig, Daniel Craig. Honestly, this movie only made my list because of . . . Daniel Craig. Had it been anyone else as bond, only would have rated it 3 stars.",positive
"Only a couple of things let this film down. 1. The theme song, hopefully not the start of a trend. 2. The fact that it would have bene better if viewed as a flashback movie, especially when using Dame Judi Dench as M. Other than that a great introduction to Daniel Craig as Bond. A fresh and darker view of 007. It opens up the possibility of the Craig era showing this aspect of Bond.",positive
"I am a very big 007 James Bond fan and This has to be one of the best James Bonds Movies out of the trilogy even though it is a new beginning for 007 and tells how he gets started. I mean the movie was awesome but they messed up on some details like CIA's Felix lighter has always been white form all the other Bond films but they made him an African American witch is cool but it dose not got with the other films and another thing that upset me is that Q and the Q gadgets are not in it witch asks another question if they do put a new Q who will play him because they cant put R aka John Cleese because this is a new beginning of James so he's not there or entered the pictur yet, now I like the new 2008 movie the Quantum of Solace but it was not as good and If they are starting from the beginning is the next one going to be Dr. No, I think It would be cool if they redid and modernized the whole trilogy so it goes with the time line and so on and so forth.",positive
"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER!!!!!! i love this... mostly because i love james bond, cards, and daniel craig. all in all, this was a great combonation for me",positive
One of the better Bond films. Good action--and Eva Green is easy on the eye,positive
I LOVE IT.............................IT´S AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
the 3 stars are for the body only ..the film was boring,negative
"My favorite thing about the movie was the action sequences and the poker scenes. To simply put it, I liked this movie",negative
"Here goes, the only Bond film I actively didn't go see in theaters in my life time, I regret that decision. Most of my complaints actually still stand except Daniel Craig, maybe its the other movies that caused this but he really grew on me as a Bond actor and this is coming from someone who was sold on him from my first viewing, but I'm no longer looking for every flaw in his performance. Most of my complaints are with the 1st third of the film, I just find it boring. Ya the stunts are cool and a godsend after Die Another Day's CGI fest but I just find... I don't care. The opening credits just feels arty for the sake of being arty not because it helped tell the story. Thinking about it the stuff I don't care about is the prequel stuff, I don't care about Bond's past. He's more interesting not knowing much. For me the movie doesn't get going until they arrive at the casino then all my problems melt away and it becomes a fantastic Bond film. Some find it boring but the tension during the poker game is amazing and great proof you don't need people hitting each other to be interesting. The relationship is well done and the plot from that point on is intriguing to watch. It all averages out to be a very good Bond for getting us back on track but certainly not the ""BEST BOND EVAR!!!"" as some are prone to say.",positive
"Craig is an excellent choice to play Bond, and the only reason I saw this film. but having the bulk of the movie focus on game of Texas Holdem was like watching ESPN in the off season.",negative
Best Bond movie yet...,positive
Daniel Craig is the next Sean Connery.,positive
Honestly there have been way better Bond movies.,negative
"Casino Royale is a great action movie. But a Bond movie? Not so much. It just lacks all the signature Bond references that we have come to love over the years. I will say though that although Connery still remains the greatest Bond ever, Craig does an admirable job giving the character a rough edge.",negative
perfect action movie,positive
"Recently promoted to 00 status, James Bond takes over his first mission, in which he faces a mysterious private banker to world terrorism and poker player, Le Chiffre. Along with a beautiful Treasury agent and the MI6 man in Montenegro, Bond takes part in a high stakes poker game set up by Le Chiffre in order to recover a huge sum of his clients' money he lost in a failed plot that the British spy took down. 007 will not only discover the threatening organization behind his enemy, but the worst of all truths: to not trust on anyone.",positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond.Good action film.,positive
One of the best Bonds I ever saw. Contains two horrible scenes: the torture with the rope and the destruction of the wonderful Aston Martin.,positive
Growing up with Roger Moore as Bond this guy is the opposite of that. Just didn't like it.,negative
Classic Bond as how he should be,positive
Superb - especially in BluRay,positive
"I'm not a Bond fan, but I liked this one.",positive
Best Bond movie since Goldeneye!,positive
"Not as fun as a Sean Connery Bond film, but it will do. Fun action sequences, good acting, great locations and a great theme by former Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell. Plot is a little silly, but it works. And even leads nicely into Quantum Of Solace for us. Enjoy.",negative
"Great action, but not a""Bond"" movie, except in name.... A disappointment that the winning formula has been killed by the hollywood blockbuster, politically correct set... bring on a real Bond movie",negative
Great reboot. But i think time will tell if it truly is the greatest in the series. I am still unconvinced.,negative
"This is the first of the post Roger Moore Bond films that I've seen, and it was better than I expected it to be. The franchise has been modernized, which is definitely a good thing. Still like the Sean Connery ones better though, the cold war was just so suited for the suave spy thing.",negative
Daniel Craig is a great new James Bond~! Lovedhim~! An excellent 007 film. Must see~!,positive
Great Bond...and way better than the Quantom!,negative
enfin James Bond un peu plus humain et agressif,positive
Not who i would have chosen to play the new bond but good movie,positive
"The most Raw 007 movie ever. Bond is more real, he makes mistakes! I suspect Daniel Craig would be my favorite Bond if I could decipher the accent reliably. If it weren't for the audio/thick accents I would have given this movie a higher rating.",negative
"not bad a movie also,won the best stunt for that year though but still not like QUANTOM OF SOLICE",negative
good like bond moves,positive
It just went on and on and on...,negative
"http://expletivedleted.livejournal.com/149977.html Well hellooooo there James Blonde, er, I mean, Bond. Daniel Craig, I have been waiting for you. Pre-project, one of the main reasons I usually named Craig as my favorite was because he was simply the one that stuck with me most. But now, having really watched his predecessors, he's still my boy. The quick reason is that I like how much darker his films are. He's more ruthless. He's got his sense of humor, but it's much more biting and sarcastic. He unapologetically defies authority. His storylines are more personal. There's more at stake for him, and thus you see his defenses are up. Every other Bond took a few films to distinguish themselves. Craig nailed his own completely different interpertation right away, while at the same time staying true to some of the basics of the character. I remember the first time I saw Casino Royale. It would be the first 007 I saw in the theater. It was Thanksgiving day, and I had just enough time to run to the movies before I had to get my green bean casserole in the oven before dinner with friends. I expected to find the place filled with dads and their kids, trying to keep the kitchen clear for mom. There weren't quite as many as I'd expected, but those familial units were certainly present. Something else that struck me when I first watched this back then was that it seemed that the people behind 007 finally realized something: girls watch these movies too! Let's face it. James Bond is very much a man's man. The way he kicks butt and beds women, there's no denying that it's been all guys running the show. For once, they threw a little eye candy our way, again with an obvious nod to Honey Ryder. He's also not as blatant of a womanizer. Sure, he has the affair with the married girl (unhappily married, I might add), but you at least start getting some background on him and understand why he has these tendencies. But his relationship with Vesper is a lot more real, than any we've seen except maybe with Tracy in On Her Majesty's... It had been getting annoying how quickly girls would throw themselves at him (especially in Connery's time). Nice that he's actually gotta work for it a bit now. Also, did you notice that except for the quick image of Vesper, there's no women prancing around in the opening credits? More on that later. Til this point, every time we've changed actors, we've just sorta picked up the story where we left off. Casino Royale is the first reboot the franchise. Or really, you could argue that it's not actually a reboot, more of a rewind. We never really did get an origin story. Even then, it's only a partial origin story in that it's his first mission. We don't know how he got there, but then again it's maybe better that way. We don't get a ""Bond. James Bond"" until the last seconds of the film, but that point, he is definitively Bond. James Bond. And it's beautiful. Now that we're past 20 movies in, there's so many pieces to the franchise, and I love seeing all of the winks to the audience. Some more obvious than others. Obvious: ""Would you like that shaken or stirred"" ""Does it look like I give a damn"". Less obvious: Have you noticed he has a favorite brand of champagne? That would be Bollinger. Or the throwback to the silly Bond girl names by trying to give Vesper the alias ""Stephanie Broadchest"". I love Eva Green as Vesper Lynd. She doesn't have a flimsy, based on intense experience connection with him. Instead she really does get thru and connects with him. Their first interaction might be my favorite scene. Such sharp dialog back and forth. Skewered. I'd been saying how much I love Judi Dench as M. With Brosnan, I just liked her for the fact that she was more hands on. But with Craig, I love the kind of relationship that they have. He's so insubordinate and arrogant, but at the same time there's a deep level of mutual respect. I'm really excited to watch the next couple (Skyfall especially) with these interactions fresher in my head. Also, here's where we ""first"" meet Felix Leiter of the CIA. The first time I saw this, I got the sense that he was important, I just didn't know my 007 history enough to know how. Now I get it. Been throwing around the phrase ""one of my favorites"" when talking about the various theme songs. However, I figured out how to narrow it down. If I could only listen to one theme ever again, which would it be. Immediately my brain went to Chris Cornell's ""You Know My Name"". Yes, this one is definitely my favorite. I may even think so about the credit sequence as well. It plays on the whole casino theme and instead of featuring dancing naked girls, there's some really cool stylized fight sequences. I like it because A)it's different and 2) it brings the focus to James. Makes it feel like it's more a part of the movie and not just an afterthought. http://www.expletivedleted.com http://www.twitter.com/expletivedleted http://www.facebook.com/expletivedleted",positive

fantastic movie! my first Bond movie and I absolutely loved it!,positive
good- i think it had good action and compared to my memories of the other bond movies he is much more convincing at being a cold hearted uncaring tool of the government--- the other bonds of recent years have been more playboy and not action,positive
An excellent reboot of the Bond series.,positive
Craig IS Bond...'nuff said,positive
"A Bond film that belongs in the pantheon of ""Goldfinger"" and ""From Russia, with Love.""",positive
Very boring movie. Typical Bond to the point where it seems like they are all the same no matter the cast or time period. The ending draged to the point where I turned it off.,negative
"An absolutely great action-adventure movie!!!! Full of stunts, action, and thrills! Craig's performance surpasses expectations; no need for the gadgets of previous 007 movies; Daniel is the main gadget; he's all in one! He plays the 007 version to the maximum; he embodies the character with passion, an edge, sharpness..., Daniel is absolutely awesome! Eva is pretty good herself; the witty exchanges between the two characters bring a nice humorous touch to the movie! Some scenes could've taken secondary place without affecting the plot. This is the BEST 007 movie ever made, and Daniel, you nailed it; you made the movie what it is!!! I'm sure you didn't need me to tell you this, but you're an AWESOME actor!!!",positive

One of the best Bond movies ever!,positive
pity the follow up was total guf,positive
right up there with Goldeneye as one of the best bonds ever,positive
"I love action movies and this one was exceptional. I prefer it when the action sequences look somewhat plausible, as they did, for the most part, in this one. They seemed more plausible than the stunts in far too many action flicks of late, like the MI series. The story is good, but I would've preferred more poker scenes and less poke her ones. But I recognize the guys who love Bond want the babes. You didn't get much, but we did get some, yeah baby. I for one was glad that the silly names for the women was dispensed with, except for Bond's one feeble attempt to call her Broadchester in the cab--hey, enough of that! :D No one in the audience I saw it with got that but for me. I think that was because too much of the dialogue was poorly enunciated throughout the movie. I especially like that the writers didn't treat us like idiots who have to have everything spelled out, but actors, talk clearly already. Please? Too many movie actors nowadays try to talk like ""real folk"" but the problem is real folk can't talk. What Craig brought to the role was charisma and a wry smile when he has pulled off a coup over the bad guy. Craig is subtle, and not such a manicured pretty boy like some Bonds, save one. But there really is only one true Bond--Connery, Sean Connery. But Craig is a heart-throbbing second. Really, not a bad place to be, considering the Connery legacy he has to stare down. I think he did it well.",negative
Grit doesn't become Bond. And the casino aspect was pretty silly.,negative
"So ... the men are criminals, the women are skanks, and apparently there is some sort of plot. Don't worry, the cars and villas are 'bloody top notch.'",positive
Daniel Craig - YUMMY,positive
"Si se busca entretenciÃ³n a travÃ©s de acciÃ³n y sorpresas, esta pelÃ­cula cumple con la fÃ³rmula muy bien. Es muy entretenida, con un Bond bastante violento, una historia que no da respiro y un final bastante demoledor. Ah y ademÃ¡s hay bonitas localidades y escenarios.",positive
one of my favorite movies,positive
The best Bond since Goldeneye.,positive
Arm yourself because no one else here will save you:) Simply great new series has just started.,positive
A great reinvention of James Bond. Daniel Craig is great.,positive
"A great re-imagining of the Bond series, and just about the only Bond movie in recent history which I can stand.",negative
"A good first outing for Daniel Craig as Bond, but it's a shame that QoS took Bond in the wrong direction. Product placement was annoying.",positive
"This Bond film was the first I had seen for years - since Tomorrow Never Dies to be more precise, which was released in 1997. I caught Daniel Craig's first attempt at being Bond during the holidays and must say that I quite liked the way the script was written differently and put forward a darker Bond than I was used to seeing. I guess it is trendy to do that now. With Batman Begins, you find out how Bruce Wayne became Batman, and with Casino Royale you understand why Bond becomes a serial womaniser and why he frustrates his boss, M. He also gets his Aston Martin by winning at a card game. Casino Royale had its moments (the chase scene at the beginning, or the bit when he drinks poison and nearly dies) but on the whole failed to leave any impact on me. The plot twist at the end was obvious and the bad guy - apart from staring and crying blood drops - doesn't really have any threat. I suppose it is more Bond having to deal with himself more than anything else. Craig puts in a good performance and so does love interest Eva Green. The film shows you the basics of the Bond series, so I suppose the hi-tech gadgets, Ms Monneypenny, and the charismatics one-liners may come in the next Bond films - perhaps Quantum of Solace? (Anybody seen it by the way?) I award Casino Royale a pretty average 2 stars because not much happens and I was expecting a lot more action and a little more cool and prestige from Bond. The next rating (Quantum of Solace) should shed more light on the way I think Bond movies are going.",negative
Maybe the best Bond movie.,positive
Need to see it again for final judgement - but thought it was good,positive
pretty good bond as an action hero,negative
"Together with Goldfinger the best James Bond movie ever. Though it felt a bit cheezy with Bond falling in love, strutting around, there in the middle.",positive
"For my first Bond film, I was impressed. It was action packed and had a good story line. I like him as Bond. Good job.",negative
"Best James Bond i have ever seen....Daniel Craig is a mix of Sean Connery and Timothy Dalton my two favorites before this movie!!! This movie has everything and shows James Bond isnt perfect, he falls in love, kills, and does a whole lot more than ever before. Hands down best James Bond and one of my most favorite movies!",positive
"Craig looks too much like Poetin - like the russians that previous Bonds needed to kill. Confusing - but I do like ""M"".",negative
"Lots of suspense at the card game,which is what was needed. Lots of action and Daniel Craig does an incredible job as James Bond. The villian is not dangerous but very intelligent. It also introduces a hot Bond girl Vesper Lynd and it reintroduces us to Bond's Aston Martin DB5.",positive
"You're not going to get one of my normally long and thorough reviews here. (Since it's a year late.) Have too many more to write now that it's Oscar season. A spectacular Bond film! The action sequences were top notch (although I kept thinking how bruised Mr. Craig must've been). Saw (spoiler alert!) the Eva Green twist coming a mile away the moment things became touching, but who cares. The end left me in tears. Giancarlo Gianna was a bit terrible...and Jeffrey Wright very underused. Daniel Craig is fantastic as Bond...and please keep Judi Dench as M forever!",positive
Best bond movie that came out that year. Best bond yet..,positive
"Although this Bond is far different than the others, I still liked the character. Makes sense he's not as polished since this is supposed to take place before the others. Although I felt like the story lacked substantially at times, still a very good movie with an ending that wasn't as Hollywood as it could have been.",positive
Really like Daniel Craig's work in this movie.,positive
Craig revitalizes the Bond franchise with a fucking vengence. The opening scene alone tells you this film is gonna be balls-to-the-wall awesome. Perhaps the best in the series.,positive
"Loved this one. its good how they finally connected two bond movies. excellent acting, great plot, amazing beaches lol great everything",positive
"not a bad film but then not a good film neither, he may well be bond but this film just does not compare to the rest of the bond's i think they could of made it more interesting, worth a watch if you have nothing else to do with your time.",negative
Bond Begins or Bond Reloaded.,positive
"This Bond film is the best one by far, i'm glad they have taken it more serious and got away from the stupid gadets and the crap humour, the chase scene with bomber through the building site was awesome, as far as i'm concerned Daniel Craig is James Bond.",positive
"When Sean Connery appeared in the third 007 thriller ""Goldfinger"" in 1964, the James Bond film franchise had won audiences over with its surefire formula of combining girls and gadgets with epic international criminal intrigue. James Bond always tangled with megalomaniacal villains whose larger-than-life ambitions dwarfed the skulduggery of commonplace lawbreakers. Each Bond adventure emerged as an event decked out with stunts galore and often a chart-topping title tune. The ""Casino Royale"" title tune is instantly forgettable. The formula served the series well as the last Pierce Brosnan 007 thriller ""Die Another Day"" amassed more than $400-million-plus at the box office in 2002. Fearful that they couldn't top themselves again and fresh out of imaginative ideas, the Bond producers decided to start from scratch, like George Lucas didâwith far greater credibility than he is givenâwith ""Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace."" Not only did the 007 producers send Pierce Brosnan packing, but they also trashed their tried-and-true formula. Anybody remember the new Coke? Well, Sony and Columbia Pictures, which bought out United Artistsâthe distributor of the previous 20 Bond picturesâhave unveiled the new Bond. If you look at the money that ""Casino Royale"" has generated and you read the critics, the new Bond and the actor impersonating himâDaniel Craig of the first ""Tomb Raider"" movieâare performing better than anybody could have surmised. Most new Bonds amount to underachievers, such as ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (1969) and ""Live and Lie Die"" (1973), and Bonds that forsake the formula usually crash and burn. Aside from its earnings and its widespread critical support, ""Casino Royale"" is barely a Bond opus. Neither M's secretaryâMiss Moneypennyânor Bond's gadget supplying guyâQ, show up in the 21st 007 thriller. The producers have dispensed with risquÃ© names for the heroines and the villainesses, and the stunts are largely low-tech. The clever one-liners that our globe-trotting hero spouts and the larger-than-life villains are both conspicuously absent. Instead, ""Casino Royale"" qualifies as a prequel, showing how James Bond acquired his license to kill before he became the polished practitioner of seduction and sadism in the earlier 007 outings. No, the new Bond is set in the here and now rather than the yonder of yesteryear. Actually, the black & white opening sequence is supposed to take place before the first Bond movie ""Dr. No"" and then the remainder of the movieâin colorâoccurs after ""Die Another Day."" Along the way, the filmmakers have cherry picked only bits and pieces from the 1953 Ian Fleming original novel where the redoubtable, double-0 agent made his debut. Suffice it to say that ""Casino Royale"" establishes James Bond's lethal credentials and shows him gambling with a crafty criminal genius in a high-stakes poker game. Compared with previous Bonds, ""Casino Royale"" is about neither the next plot to take over the world nor a devious scheme to mastermind the perfect crime. James Bond earns his license to kill status in the opening black & white sequences that lack any kind of excitement and seem rather like a picnic for him. He beats a guy up in a public restroom and outsmarts an opponent who holds him at gunpoint with an empty weapon. Afterward, Bond makes a buffoon of himself by shooting dead a couple of people at a foreign embassy and getting caught on a surveillance camera in the act of killing! Of course, M (Judi Dench of the Brosnan Bonds) is predictably furious. ""In the old days, if an agent did something that embarrassing, he'd at least have the good sense to defect."" Later, British Intelligence learns that Le Chiffre (Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen of ""King Arthur""), who bankrolls terrorists, has got to win big at the gambling tables at Casino Royale or face death from one of his savage, machete-wielding African clients. M sends Bond to beat Le Chiffre at cards, and the British Treasury assigns Vesper Lynd (Parisian actress Eva Green of ""Kingdom of Heaven"") to see that 007 doesn't blow the big bucks. ""GoldenEye"" director Martin Campbell is back calling the shots on Bond 21. He must have forgotten, however, what makes a good Bond. First, ""Casino Royale"" clocks in at 144 tedious minutes, the longest Bond on recordâlonger than Peter Hunt's ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" Second, there are lengthy stretches where nothing extraordinary happens. The color opening set piece where Bond and a black villain cavort around a construction site as if they had wings on their ankles grows tiresome but looks spectacular. Later, a white-knuckled fight in a motel stairwell goes on ad-nauseam. The chief villain is appropriately ruthless, but he doesn't do anything to make you genuinely hate him. He does whip Bond into a frenzy in one scene, but that's small potatoes compared with other Bond bad guys. Actually, the secondary villains pose more of a threat than Le Chiffre and his clowns. Most, ""Casino Royale"" is humdrum and humorless in its efforts to be realistic. The Robert Wade and Neal Purvis screenplay offers few surprises (especially if you've perused the Ian Fleming novel) and the movie serves up two false endings before an explosive but hardly exciting finale in urban renewal in the exotic city of Venice. The only thing that differentiates Le Chiffre is his ability to shed a bloody tear or two. Daniel Craig plays James Bond as a hopelessly straightforward and tight-lipped, blue-collar thug with muscles. He resembles a cross-between of Steve McQueen of ""Bullitt"" and Yoda from ""Star Wars."" He is tough and rugged but lacks charisma. Furthermore, he has to rely on others to get him out of tight spots. Indeed, if it weren't for Vesper Lynd, Bond would never have accomplished his missionâbittersweet as it turns out. ""Casino Royale"" ranks as an uninspired but ambitious stab to make over one of the most successful franchises in film history. As a traditional, old-school Bond fan, ""Casino Royale"" left me neither shaken nor stirred.",negative
"With Casino Royale, the producers have managed to turn the Bond franchise into a new direction without losing the essential spirit that defines it. Daniel Craig is the 21st Century Bond, there is no one better for the job and I couldn' t imagine anyone else than Eva Green playing Vesper like Ian Fleming described her in the book. The film stays closely to the book whenever possible (the cold war being over, they had to change that part), but even the torturing scene was realized very closely to the book. This film explains how Bond became the man he is in all the other films and why he never lets anyone near his heart after Vesper. Since this is his first assignment as a double-0, he has to tame his ""over-developed trigger finger"" and learn that it' s not enough to be a blunt instrument. There are brilliant locations, actors and dialogues and the director has done a good job, too. He managed to introduce Pierce Brosnan to the role of Bond and has done an even better job on Craig. Thumbs up!",positive
The best Bond by far!,positive
Brilliant film!! Loved it!!!,positive
Bond movies don't get much better than this!!!,positive
clearly the best bond made,positive
"Bello tecnicamente e come intensità,splendida eva green forse un pò lunghetto",positive
"Really like Craig's Bond, but meh ... it's Bond. That's 2 hours & 24 minutes of my life I won't get back again. Poker game was cool, a couple of twists in the plot, but I wish I'd watched an episode of Dexter instead ... or read a book.",negative
Loveeeed It :D .. But Not When The Poor Car Got Cripled :(:( .. X,positive
"This was a very good movie. The guy who plays James Bond is what I would expect James Bond to be like, kind of ruthless and uncaring, not like the other ones, who were a little wimpy.",positive
Definitely one of the best Bonds EVER !!!!! EVER !!!!,positive
slightly better than quantum of solace,positive
"A very wonderful return for Bond, played with grit and unblemished violence by DC. The story keeps a good pace, and there are just enough twists to keep you guessing (well, a little... I managed to stay a step ahead of the story).",positive
"This movie that has everything. High action, and dispensed appropriately thoughout the movie to keep me interested the whole time. Hot euro cars, hot women, hand-to-hand combat, bond-on-car chasing,.. I really do love this movie. Thanks to Daniel Craig for making 007 HOT HOT HOT again! My Sweet Revenge!",positive
"i liked it like mad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i thought it would be bad , but it turned out to be great!",positive
"This Bond seems to not entirely able to decide what sort of a person he is, but maybe that's something that's worked out more in Quantum of Solace. Have you noticed the Bond movies never have a back-story? Even this, which should have been the ""first"" movie in the series, assumes we already know who James Bond and MI-6 really are. Even the new Batman got a back-story. That said, it's still a good set-up for a new series of films and gets you ready for the next movie.",positive
4 stars ! ! ! ! All the way ! ! ! My all time favorite.,positive
"a badly needed breathe of fresh air to the bond franchise. daniel craig is excellent for this roll. a gritty, rough bond before the gadgets and clean cut bond as we know...i didn't like the chemistry between eva green and him, but you have to love one-liners and that car! made me want to continue to enjoy this series of the most famous secret agent 007...",positive
"This is what James Bond should have been all along. With a strong emphasis on following the original Ian Fleming novel while updating it for the new era, it is smart, well-scripted, visually exciting, and sophisticated without any of the goofy fluff of previous Bond movies. It takes itself and the subject matter seriously, which we haven't seen since On Her Majesty's Secret Service.",positive
Makes the Pierce Brosnan films look like a joke!,positive
"Daniel Craig brings 007 into a side that we have never seen and daniel is a mix of pierce and sean and this makes 007 with daniel crag a good bond, who cares if his hair is blonde, this is a must see movie, daniel also shows 007 really has feelings, and not just a ruthless british assain.",positive
"Well, it took me about 4 seconds to get over the fact that it was Blond, James Blond. The pacing was excellent, the fight scenes well choreographed. There was just enough over the top Bondiness for the die-hard bond fan and the running gag of trying *not* to be the same old Bond was good for a chuckle up until the end. I can not wait to see the sequel, unfortunately, even though it took Netflix a while to get to this on my queue, the sequel still isn't out on video yet. :(",positive
Party poker done hollywood style!!!and a mini hospital in bonds car.,negative
"An enjoyable ""reboot"" of the Bond franchise.",positive
movie was the fuckig shit,positive
The action has never looked better in a bond pitchure. And Daniel Craig is the best bond to date. Excellent film.,positive
"Not the best Bond flick, but decent enough for a newcomer Daniel Craig to bite into. The imperfect brute pre-007 is a good character development model you can build on.",negative
"Representative of all of the Bond movies - my faves are Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Daniel Craig.",positive
One of the only Bond movies I've liked.,negative
"too long, sometimes quiet boring",negative
One of the Top Bonds,positive
One of the best Bond movies...,negative
"For my first Bond film, I was impressed. It was action packed and had a good story line. I like him as Bond. Good job.",negative
Fresh new start but WAY to much product placement!,negative
"Don't think poker games really count as action scenes, but it was still fun.",negative
"Never thought that Daniel Craig could be a good James Bond but he is quite convincing. Interesting to witness the ""birth"" of 007!",negative
"Best Bond movie to date, I don't care if he is a bit out of character.",positive
I am not a bond fan but I like this movie,positive
"It was hard at first to evision Daniel Craig as 007 but he managed to pull it off. Not many nifty gadgets in this one. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE FELL IN LOVE IN THIS STORY LINE! Why now?.....oh, to build up to the revenge-filled sequel....that's right.",negative
Who watches Bond flicks to see a love story? Seems like blatant pandering to a certain demographic...totally ruined it for me though.,negative
"And I thought Bond would never get really really good again after GoldenEye. Well it is by the guy that did GoldenEye, so I suppose that might be why?",positive
My first Bond movie. Can you believe it??,negative
for adventure movies really like it!! =D,negative
loved new bond. best bond ever.,positive
The best Bond for a very long time. This kicks some ass.,positive
This was much better than Quantum of Solace. I can now see why so many people like the James Bond movies.,positive
"I got bored part way through, but it was ok",negative
Loved it! Best Bond movie since the Sean Connery era.,positive
R.I.P. James Bond 1962-2006,negative
"I wasn't a fan of Pierce Brosnan, and yet I always love a Bond film, for me Daniel Craig has made the perfect start in the role as bond. This film has a lot more grit than previous bonds. Fantastic keep it up Mr. Craig.",positive
"Yeah, I kind of dugged this. I can't wait to see the next one.",negative
absolutely brillant bond film daniel craig makes amazing bond may he continue,positive
"For me, Bond movies get no better than this. Based on the original novel by Ian Fleming but greatly developed, it is Daniel Craig's much criticised first turn as 007, as they laid into him before he had even appeared. How critics ate their words. The movie's stark pre-credit scene, the fabulously conceived credits themselves and the stunning two opening scenes alone are worth admission to any theatre and place this into a special category, simply for impact, direction and imagination. Judy Dench is the perfect foil for Craig's edgy, hard, professional bond. In a sense he perfected what they tried with [name]. There is a delightful about-turn cross reference with Craig emerging a la Arsula Andress from the waves, pecs rippling more than the water. The digitalis ressuscitation scene (try saying that when you're pissed) is a clever departure even if it stretches credibility a touch (Craig is a sort of Six Million Dollar Man on Carlsberg, he does not need a tank to go through walls like his predecessor, he just walks through them). It would not have been possible for Roger Moore, likable and talented though he is, to play the torture scene. It would have been more credible with Julian Clary. Craig pulls that off spectacularly. His brutal, harsh Bond is ideal, and this gritty realism is what the franchise needed - less nebular plots focus the character in a world we feel we recognise. The scripting is first class. The only minor twinge of concern is whether the love relationship is handled well enough to convince. It does show how versatile Craig is as an actor. The support cast is outstanding, the Matthis character comes back as does the american CIA and there is an excellent creepy villian, Le Chiffre, played so well. Ok so Bond is indestructible but the plot to action balance and use of technology are superbly judged, the narrative is very continuous and coherent and the pace of the movie is excellent. The best Bond movie ever. If you miss this, you will never know.",positive
"The Best ""Modern Era"" Bond movie... by far. You've got to dig Daniel Craig's Parkour chase with Sebastien Foucan (one of the founders of Parkour)... don't you??! Wish I could run like that... (sigh!)",positive
Daniel Craig is the man. Best Bond so far!,positive
he is not as good a bond as brosnan or connery,negative
"Como en 40 años o algo así de Bond en el cine jamas se había visto esto un Bond vulgar, sucio y zarrapastroso que se puede ubicar a la altura de cualquier héroe de película de acción barata una verdadera lastima que solo se justifica diciendo que este el inicio de una nueva saga",negative
The only James Bond movie I've ever seen. No really. The opening action sequence had me literally on the edge of my seat. Very entertaining.,positive
I was getting tired of Pierce Brosnan. Only this could have made me like the Bond films again.,positive
"awesome. this film restored my faith in bond (as a film series, and as a character)...it had just the right balance of everything, delivery was pretty much spot on as well...congrats bond film makers, you've finally got it right (in a while!). ...too bad you're about to cock it up with Quantum of Shite.",positive
"Casino Royale is a great action movie, but it rises above the genre because of Daniel Craig's wonderfully fresh portrait of Bond and a great script. An exciting movie to watch.",positive
Got to get used to the new Bond.,negative
"Y pensar que primero vi Quantum Of Solace, la cual me dejo muchas dudas, ahora entiendo un poco mas la trama global de esta nueva saga del 007, pinta buena!",positive
"Wonderful dialogue writing, Bond, M and vesper all are great. A very very entertaining film indeed.",positive
Best Bond film for years,positive
One of the best Bond movies you can find,positive
Nunca antes me habia interesado James Bond Yo adoro a Pierce Brosnan pero nunca me comi el cuento Bond en cambio Craig llega para comprometerme con la franquicia mientras el dure con ella.,positive
i wish the second one was as good as this one.,positive
"Great story, and intro into who Bond is, and Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery.",positive
"royale dodo! it was not that bad, but it was not that good.",negative
"The best in the Bond series. The action is phenomenal, the movie never has a dull moment, and it's even able to make a card game nail-bitingly intense. The tone is perfect for james bond. Just enough cheese to where it's completely badass, and not at all over the top. And even if there is a cheesy moment, there are badass moments tenfold.",positive
uhmmm cukup bagus untuk newcomer dari Bond...... Daniel Looks fat in this movie,positive
"Just reviewed Quantum of Solace and mentioned this movie in the review. So I owe it its own review. In my personal opinion, the greatest entry in the bond series to date. Craig is my personal favorite Bond. This movie knows that Bond is so much more than an action hero. He's a person who can be hurt. In addition, one of the most painful scenes I've ever watched. Men, you know which one I'm talking about.",positive
alright not the best movie i have seen nor the best james bond i have seen. Daniel Graig is a good actor but he can't playing james bond right and the new james bond film are missing the famours bonds cars being them back.,negative
Dynamic!!! Clever!!!,positive
"didn't feel like the ""general"" bond movies. But I guess that could be a good thing.",positive
Heavy on action. I normally don't like Bond movies but I enjoyed this one a lot.,positive
"Actions-packed and yet strangely dark, this movie carries a good plot but left my mind a little parched in the entertainment department.",negative
what a movie loved it so much Eva Green is smokin hot in this,positive
very physical. love the new OO7 actor. he's hot and very man,positive
Phoar. Well worth the wait.,positive
"This has got to be one of the best Bond movies ever. From the opening credits to Chris Cornell's brilliant song ""You Know My Name,"" [i]Casino Royale[/i] speeds through one great scene after another until it reaches it's amazing climax action sequence. Daniel Craig proves that he is James Bond 007, and he does so incredibly well. Although a large departure from the previous Bond adventures, [i]Casino Royale[/i] deserves to be ranked along the likes of [i]Goldfinger[/i]. With exciting action, a very well written script by [i]Die Another Day[/i] scribes Niel Purvis and Robert Wade, as well as newcomer Paul Haggis, and boasting inspired direction from [i]Goldeneye's[/i] Martin Campbell, [i]Casino Royale[/i] really is that good. Characters like Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), as well as many others complementing Daniel Craig make this movie all the better. This is the by far superior effort compared to the newer [i]Quantum Of Solace[/i], so I advise to skip that new Bond movie with the strange title, and pick up a copy of [i]Casino Royale[/i] on DVD or Blu-Ray and spend the night at home.",positive
Excellent first Bond film for Craig,positive
Este Bond es el peor! Le falta todo!,negative
A good start to what would hopefully turn out to be a great fracnhise with David Craig.,positive
one of the bonds best´s it gives a new reality of the 00,positive
nada como el james bond clasico,negative
"eh...a lot better than quantum but still...dont really feel for bond..he's wooden faced, boring, and completely unbelievable when it comes to falling in love....he doesnt kill the movie, its still not bad but....could be so much better",negative
was really good saw it like 6 times,positive
"It's unfortunate they succeeded Campbell with Forster, this was a really good movie.",negative
what excellent non-stop action!,positive
"One of the best action movies of the past years. Incredibly interesting, well plotted, well executed. Great job of director Martin Campbell, giving a whole new approach to the Bond legend. Daniel Craig gives a different, unique and very, very sexy James Bond. Good for the franchise!",positive
This Movie can NOT be topped.. just my opinion ;),positive
"I watched this and sequel ""Quantum of Solace"" out of order. I agree with Kim. It moves slower than its Part II, but it's better.",negative
"CONSENSUS: An unforeseen tour de force in the Bond franchise, which had been sluggishly crawling along with poor episodes such as DIE ANOTHER DAY. A refreshing return to the intense espionage found in 007 classics FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and DR. NO, this establishes Bond as a cold-blooded, yet emotional being. Craig is the best actor to play 007 since Connery, bringing back the much needed edge to the character. Greene is elegant and mysterious as Vesper and the rest of the supporting cast is superb. Has an intriguing plot line that is executed well and leaves us craving for the sequel QUANTUM OF SOLACE. The best Bond movie since GOLDFINGER and one of the best films of 2006. MY GRADE: A",positive
one of the best movies,positive
quality bond nonsense,positive
I've tried to watch other Bond movies but I wound up turning them off...but not this one. This movie was hot! That chase seen in the beginning was ridiculous and Daniel Craig...well...ya know ;).,positive
Good film! Daniel Craig looks nice in those shorts! By far the best Bond ever!,positive
"I just realized that this movie is connected with the Quantum of Solace....but I see the latter first....that's why some of the point I can't understand while watching it.....I should see this one first!! Well, I think Royal Casino is lot more better than the Quantum of Solace, the story is much better, and I do think James Bond is more handsome in this one....but both are Daniel Craig...how weird? :p",positive
"Holy wow, best bond movie I've ever seen. Not your typical Bond film by most measures, but just plain kick-ass, with a great plot that will take you on a tense, exciting, and very satisfying ride.",positive
"Sure Daniel Craig doesnt fit when it comes to the traditional standards of the Bond character. His acting was just superb. When Pierce Brosnan, Timothy Dalton, Sean Connery and Roger Moore called the casting of Craig a good decision. It is true. The perfect portrayal of James Bond; a cold and ruthless killer. Casino Royale is the finest 007 movie I have seen since Goldfinger. With minor changes but staying true to the Ian Fleming's work, what more can the fans of the novel want?",positive
Loved this movie. Want to have Daniel Craig's babies.,positive
"Craig fills the Bond role with style, while Campbell creates a dynamic, complex, and fun action movie with plenty of memorable action/chase scenes and classic Bond moments.",positive
absolutely awesome bond movie. They gave the franchise a flaming giant kick start. couldn't give this one a high enough rating. everything about it was great.,positive
"A new start for Bond - and about ninety minutes of good quality film. A shame the film runs for about an hour more than this. Everything is too long - protracted chase scenes, protracted conversations, protracted everything. Bizarrely enough the central point of the film, the all night card game, gets hardly any coverage (at one point the call goes out for the next hand and we're suddenly back with Bond in his room - a clumsy cut in my view!). And oh, the ludicrocity of it all. Vesper's initial conversation with Bond is about as realistic as ""The Da Vinci Code"". The chase across the scaffolding is overlong and downright silly - Bond's quarry seems to be Spiderman, able to crawl up vertical surfaces and perform leaps that would make fleas balk. And what's all this nonsense about the defibrilator in the car? Did MI6 know he was going to be poisoned and need that exact equipment ready? Otherwise, this was actually pretty formulaic. Bond's first girl dies. The second betrays him, then dies. The one-liners take a while to get going, but are cringe inducing (it'll take days, and possibly turpentine, to get that one about his little finger out of my head) when they finally arrive. I had no idea one could comfort a traumatised woman by sucking her fingers, and I don't think I'll be trying it. Still, this Bond is a little harsher than his predecessors - more ruthless, though his arrogance is as strong as ever. And the pre-00 status section in black and white at the beginning was quite witty!",negative
The Best Bond Film by far! a must see for any film fan!,positive
"Casino Royale(2006) Starring: Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Jeffrey Wright. Director: Martin Campbell. Casino Royale is the flawless revival of the greatest action franchise in cinematic history. Daniel Craig?s version of James Bond is the most compelling and enjoyable portrayal of the character in the entire series. Craig is clearly the best Bond yet. Director Martin Campbell returns to the franchise after directing Pierce Brosnan in GoldenEye, and this is by far his best work yet. Every scene is skillfully directed by Campbell and superbly acted by an immensely gifted cast. Eva Green is my favorite Bond girl yet, she?s stunningly beautiful and a joy to watch. Jeffrey Wright gives a brilliant supporting performance in this film. Wright has always been a strong supporting actor and he always manages to impress me. Mads Mikkelsen portrays the villain quite well although he?s not my favorite of the series. I?m completely undecided about who the best Bond villain is at the moment. The script by Award Winner Paul Haggis and co-writers Robert Wade and Neal Purvis is flawlessly crafted and suspensefully written. Everything about this film is amazing. Casino Royale is the best Bond film in the franchise and one of the greatest action films ever made. Daniel Craig is so damn good in the lead role, he has overshadowed everyone who has ever taken on the role in the past. He?s really quite brilliant. Casino Royale succeeds in every way imaginable. It?s a masterwork. A superb work of genius filmmaking. Brilliant in all aspects. Its nearly impossible to describe the pure brilliance of this film. The chase scene in the beginning is quite incredible and extremely compelling. Chris Cornell?s ?You Know My Name? is such an amazing theme song for this film. Once you get past the first scene you instantly know that you are watching a classic unfold in front of your eyes. Casino Royale is fast-paced, smart, witty, thrilling, and highly suspenseful. The action is intense and even the card games have a large amount of suspense to them. This is a film that keeps you constantly enthralled and never lets go until the credits roll. Daniel Craig and Eva Green have electrifying chemistry with one another, they are both phenomenal. The entire cast in this film is amazing. Casino Royale is a classic. Few films are as compelling and well made as this one. Casino Royale will instantly draw you in and make you care about what?s happening. A mesmerizing Bond film. Brilliant and suspenseful. Exceptional and extraordinary. Casino Royale is a wonderful, wonderful film.* Review Date: Friday December 19, 2008.*",positive
"Quite different from the other Bond movies, actually. Then again, it's the first chronologically. There's a big distinction in style than from its Brosnan predecessors. I was a bit thrown-off, because right until the climax there's a lack of action, but ended smoothly. Craig's not a bad Bond, but he seems a bit stone-rigid for a suave double O.",negative
best bond film for a long time to come daniel craig is a sight for sore eyes seen it many times now,negative
Too much action on foot. Not enough action on wheels!,negative
"Apres avoir epuise la veine quasi parodique et fantastico-delirante, retour d'un James Bond ultra-organique, vrai personnage fait de chair et de sang. Craig est excellent. Dommage que le film souffre de quelques longueurs sinon il aurait ete parfait.",positive
"Although a lot of people took issue with the first 10 minutes of the film, it's what won me over. Thoroughly enjoyable. Bond is back!",positive
"They turned Bonds into Jason Bourne so plenty of action and little Bond quips and innuendo. Dark & Broody, so don't expect a classic Bond film.",negative
This just might be the most gangstah ass james bond in the history of 007.....period.,positive
"Riveting! Craig is the Bond of the new millenia! He is rough, tough, impacting, agile, very attractive because he exudes that he is the ONE to get the job done and done effectively! He is non-stop action but not showy. He made this movie grand; He made Bond a man-real, cool, interesting yet vulnerable. He is a hero because he is flawed but just. This is movie-making at its best too. The storyline was smooth; the sequences well edited, nothing overdone, just right amount said, seen. And the coming of the water scene--WHOOOOAAA!!! I believe there wwere looking to a follow up on Halle Berry in Die Another Day. [Imagine these 2 together on screen-wishful thinking!] Casino Royale is not just for Bond fans, but for those who find action, intrigue and a good story in a movie medium something to pay for and enjoy. It is worth every minute and penny to see and have in your video libarary.",positive
Quite possibly the best Bond movie to date. Daniel Craig plays a great Bond and I look forward to more from him.,positive
One of my favorite James Bond movies.,positive
"As realistic as a Bond movie will ever get, this one exceeds all the usual expectations for this series.",positive
"First-rate action sequences, witty dialogue and a much more human Bond. I actually kind of liked 007 himself. Very cool movie.",positive
"Great second outing, for Craig. Can't wait for Bond 23!",positive
the one nice 007 movie,negative
OMG I loved the vintage Aston Martin . even better then the new vanquish . plus Eva Green was drop dead sexy,positive
"This solidified Daniel Craig as my favorite James Bond. The plot was interesting,the action right there where it needed to be, and Eva Green was dynamic. 007's finest Bond movie yet.",positive
Finally James Bond as he was meant to be potrayed! 5 stars!!!,positive
"Loved it, Dark , nasty no bs. This it what bond should be.",positive
"Just not a Bond movie. Action Movie yes, Bond (i.e. SPY! With gadget plix!) no.",negative
"While it did not follow the traditional ""Bond"" formula... (Evil Badguy with a Big Laser or Remote Controlled Ice melting Spaceship) This 007 film was well thought out and performed. Props to Everyone!!!",positive
Really fucking cool Bond movie... Way more dialogue and a lot less action than I anticipated but it was cool. Daniel Craig is totally wicked.,positive
much better than Quantum of solace better plot,positive
better than the new one.,positive
antes de entragar todo a alguien asegurate q no tenga secretos contigo ya q eso hasta puede costarte la vida,positive
Overall it was entertaining! All the action seemed to be at the beginning of the movie - but still ended well.,negative
Would be four stars except for how stupid it is to have to watch people play texas hold 'em,negative
Best Bond movie in ages,positive
"I was kinda iffy about the new Bond, but after this movie I think Craig definitely does Bond justice.",positive
clive owen should've been the new bond. and i can't figure out how a huge mistake like daniel craig came into being... that's all i have to say!,negative
Really good. My 1st James Bond...I'm thinking I should check out the others...,positive
"A little confusing in the beginning but still a great escape , He has to be the best bond ever and you cant fail when you have Daniel Craig and Dame Judy Dench together, a great way to spend a couple of hours Enjoy!",positive
"Well, um, I guess my expectations about what makes a good Bond movie are VERY different than other people. Start with a Bond worth rooting for! Not this petulant arse who comes from a broken home - please, do we really need to be filled in on his background? He's a spy who does spylike things. That's good enough for me. Next, how about a menacing bad guy? The only thing menacing this baddie does during the first 2 hours is threaten - and only threaten mind you - to throw some poker playing guests overboard if they don't leave. Not into shark-infested waters either. I mean, where's the evil ambition? This clown can't even keep a fortune together, which isn't even his - he's laundering money for various terrorist factions. I guess the economic crisis even affects the evil mastermind. Well, how about a clever storyline? Not really. More of a step-by-step approach. Bond shows up instantly knowing everyone and everything that's supposed to happen. I got a kick about how every key development was captured by a security camera for the British government to trace. They really ARE everywhere! In between shirt removals, we get the centerpiece poker game (yes, I'm sure they favor Texas Hold-'Em in Montenegro). This sequence made me wistful for the Celebrity Poker Showdown TV show hosted by Dave Foley because that series displayd more tension and drama. **SPOLIER ALERT** Consider this for a second: what if the poisoned drink HAD worked? Bond dies at the table and with a huge pile of chips in front of dozens of witnesses. Who do you suppose would have the biggest motive? Also, since Vesper Lynd was in need of the money to pay the blackmailers, what possible reason could she have for NOT permitting the extra $5 million to Bond? Glaring oversights like these really bugged me. In summary, I didn't think A) I would get nostalgic for the Pierce Brosnan days this quickly, and B) I would ever see another movie titled 'Casino Royale' that would give the 1967 version disaster serious competition. At least I don't have to worry about seeing any future installment of James Bond again. It's been a fun ride, but past time for me to pull the ejector seat.",negative
Gritty reboot of the bond franchise.,positive
the bond that stands head and shoulders above all the others.a great film in its own right and kudos to craig for proving the doubters wrong,positive
"As a James Bond fan -- I watched all of them with my mom -- this one was brilliant. It was the genesis of Bond, when he had plenty of swagger but wasn't all that refined. They had some brilliant action sequences, but there was more psychological tension than just being an action sequence followed by a car chase followed by a hookup with a woman. Plus -- and this is a first -- they tried to explain Bond. And got you to buy in. How cool is that?",positive
Quite possibly the best James Bond film ever. Definitely the best performance by a lead actor. It's also a tremendous adaptation of the original novel by Ian Fleming. Unmissable.,positive
What Bond films should be.,positive
Daniel Craig takes James Bond to a new look and tone. They could have made him a bit more infallible. I don't like it when the hero gets caught.,negative
Daniel Craig is the best Bond!!!,positive
"An excellent movie and a perfect way to re-start a classic movie franchise that had gotten a little... cheesy lately. Sean Connery may still be the best James Bond, but at this rate, Daniel Craig may very well surpass him in his third Bond movie.",positive
"By no means am I a Bond junkie, and have only seen a handful of them. This was an entertaining movie with some good action sequences. I think the poker scenes were ridiculously contrived (excuse me, but does anyone ever get a bad hand and fold?). I also never bought the romantic interest. Definitely worth a rental!",negative
"A refresing change of pace for the Bond films, finally casting aside the gimmicks and gadgets which always look embarrassing years later. Also, nicely corrects that abomination that was the original film of the same title.",positive
"I have not been this impressed with a movie for a long time. If I wasn't a James Bond fan before, I am now! This was amazingly well put together, well written, and well acted! You can't top this.",positive
I like Daniel Craig as the no-nonsense Bond. The fight scenes are more realistic than earlier Bond movies (i.e. the Brosnan films).,positive
By far the best 007 movie.,positive
a very good bond movie good crew en co,positive
"tis fair, but i dont that Daniel Craig is doing that good i thought he would be smart like some previous bonds did..",negative
One of the best Bond movies since the Sean Connery days.,positive
"Amazingly,I actually like the new Bond in this movie.His energy and personality makes a good Bond.Less 'fake' gadgets,more fight and action scenes,which makes it realistic.Not forgetting,this movie has a very very hot chick who intimates with Bond.Goodbye flying cars or pens that can shoot people,hellooo James Bond.",positive
The best Bond movie outside of Connery,positive
"love it.. the best bond film, I have seen.. specialy becouse of the to danes.. and Daniel Craig",positive
"craig is wonderfully intense and, for once, the film is entirely about bond, rather than about everything going on around him.",negative
"IF U WANNA LIKE ACTION , THEN THIS IS THE FILM FOR U!",positive
"MAKES BOND COOL AGAIN. Awesome action, brutal fights and the free-running stuff is great. Very cool to see Bond's origin and actual character development in a 007 film. Minus a star for the sketchy stuff, but overall it's a great flick.",positive
"Loved this movie, too bad Quantum of Solace sucked",positive
"Enesima reescritura del mito bondiano, esta vez embutido en las carnes prietas de un rubicundo ingles (Craig) con pintas de boxeador. Este Bond arranca con una buena mano: el recien estrenado 00 se presenta como un asesino sin escrupulos, inteligente, intuitivo y manipulador. Protagoniza una extraordinaria secuencia de persecucion en Madagascar y otro adrenalitico tour de force en el aeropuerto de las Bahamas. En ese primer tercio del filme, Daniel Craig convence y Martin Campbell demuestra estar sobradamente dotado para las escenas de accion, a las que despoja de la mercadotecnia de los gadgets habituales para centrarse en una fisicidad al estilo 'Bourne' (curiosa simbiosis). Un par de ases le permiten ir confiado a la hora jugar la segunda mano...Pero ahi le vienen malas cartas. La trama pierde interes. El antagonista posee el rostro, pero no la entidad suficiente (como demuestra la indiferencia con la que lo liquidan). Por si fuera poco, Bond se nos enamora. Y lo siento, pero yo no me lo creo, entre otras cosas porque Craig carece de la ductilidad suficiente como para mostrar adecuadamente los pliegues del personaje. En el momento, pues, de subir las apuestas, es cuando empiezan las dudas, aparecen los tics, y el publico empieza a olerse que este nuevo artefacto de la serie va de farol. El cansino segmento del Casino (no joke intended) lastra la pelicula, que apenas remonta con un interesante atisbo de sadomasoquismo en la escena de la tortura (probablemente inintencionado, mas debido a la mente turbia que la contempla y que esto escribe, que no a un apunte del guion). No hay mas ases en la manga, ningun comodin postrero. Para cuando las cartas estan sobre la mesa, Bond arriba a Venecia, con su novieta vestida con un jersey a rayas (puestos a derribar convencionalismos, podrian haberlo hecho con ese), donde la partida se cierra con el (simbolico) hundimiento de un vetusto pero primoroso palacete. El tan esperado poker termina en una decepcionante pareja. Un trio, si me apuran.",negative
"daniel craig is a good effing james bond. i didn't think he could follow up mr. brosnan, but fortunately i was proven wrong. made me really wanna see Quantum of Solace.",positive
good start for new bond. action packed as expected.,positive
"Okay... first of all I'm not an action movie fan. Second, this is the first James Bond movie I've ever seen. I hope they're not all this unspectacular.",negative
A truly fantastic film. Daniel Craig...excellent!,positive
That movie was the bomb,positive
"loved it! Tense, edgy and driven by character rather than showy CGU sequences",positive
"The last ACTUALLY GOOD Bond film (and not one that just appeared to be good because Brosnan was such a big stinky girl) was Licence to Kill. with Dalton. FACT. FACT!!!!!!! and as for Daniel Craig, I would rather Roger Moore was in Casino Royale at his age NOW. I would rather he had done the whole thing infront of dodgey blue screen like View to a Kill than watch charmless, ugly twat Craig hamfistedly play the role but, it is a Bond Movie and for that alone I give it 3 stars",negative
"Yum, yum, yum. Thank you, Mr. Bond, uh, I mean, Mr. Craig, for accepting the role of 007.",positive
Daniel Craig is a better Bond than Pierce Brosnan. Interesting poker scene.,positive
"great movie...this is not the same james bond you all know with the flashy gadgets and ""take over the world"" scenarios anymore...this gets more realistic...with situations that any normal agency would deal with in real life..terrorism, gambling, import/export...it has a classy style to it, makes you feel like you're watching a sean connery classic.",positive
"For my first Bond film, I was impressed. It was action packed and had a good story line. I like him as Bond. Good job.",negative
I love this story. Love it.,positive
"es bueno ver una pelicula de un personaje clasico esta vez sin tantas absurdeces tecnolgicas y esta vez con un bien logrado argumento, Daniel Craig muestra a un Bond mas humano, sin tantas pretensiones y sin la pinta de Superheroe como las de su antecesor Pierce Brosnan, las sagas de Craig sin duda seran Muy interesantes.",positive
"A tight script, a return to realism over the gorging use of CGI and a plot that is believable for contemporary times make this a fine film, Bond or not. Doubters of Craig have to eat their words and the breaking of tradition is not done for its own sake but rather works within the film.",positive
"Newly-promoted to the 00 section, James Bond (Daniel Craig) thwarts a scheme of shady financier LeChiffre (Mads Mikkelsen). LeChiffre stages a high-stakes poker tournament in Montenegro, hoping to recoup his lost money, and M (Judi Dench) has Bond enter the game, intent on bankrupting his opponent. He is teamed with Vesper Lynd (Green), a treasury official who holds the purse-strings on Bond's table stakes. In one film, Daniel Craig re-vamps, re-vilitilises and re-invents Bond and proves the Bond franchise could well be the one to beat.",positive
"Watched it again after seeing Quantum of Solace. Overall it is a better film. The lengthy Casino scenes weren't even as tiresome as I remembered them. The plot is more compelling, there's more wit, even the fights are more amusing. The moment Bond gets his head plunged into a steering wheel only for the horn to go off should go down as a classic.",positive
"Like an idiot I saw Quantum of Solace first, but I juest couldn't wait. Casino Royal I have to say packs more punch and more bite than Quantum. It is just awsome. Casino is poised full of tension, twists and turns and it's just an aswome Kick-Ass movie. As much as I hate to say it, Daniel, does James Bond more justic than Pierce. Sorry mate, Daniel has taken over!!!",positive
"What can I say ... this makes ALL previous Bond movies look extremely silly, and all other Bonds look like women. Daniel Craig IS BOND .. forever {hopefully}. The hard action, the gritty direction, the lush settings, Bond's harshness, the private Bond jokes and one of my fav romances EVER make this one of my all time favs. DO NOT engage me on this one; THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF REAL BOND. ALL PREVIOUS MOVIES ARE DEEMED REDUNDANT.",positive
James Bond rocks my socks. Daniel Craig is the king of all James Bonds. Love it!,positive
"You know my name! hehe yes it's James Bonda and Daniel Craig is exactly what the movies needed raw gut-busting action. Daniel Craig, could he be one of the greatest?",positive
"great new bond, to long though",positive
The most realistic and best of all Bond films. Doesn't rely on hi tech gadgets to make the movie.,positive
"Recientemente tuve la oportunidad de ver de nuevo esta pelicula, todo en anticipacion de ver inmediatamente ""Quantum of Solace"", y la verdad es que me gusto igual o mas que la primera vez que la vi. Antes de que la estrenaran hace un par de anos, tenia mis dudas sobre Daniel Craig como James Bond, mas que todo por lo que nos tenia acostumbrado Pierce Brosnan en los ultimos anos. Despues de haber visto ""Casino Royale"", puedo decir con seguridad que Daniel Craig ES James Bond!!! Craig le da un aire nuevo al personaje, y nos lo presenta como el mejor Bond de todos los tiempos! Es mas rudo, se ensucia las manos, es mas inteligente que nadie, logra ponerte de su lado y te hace creer que este super espia existe, y es muy real. Lo mejor de esta historia es que es el inicio de James Bond como el agente 007. Vemos como gano su rango, pero sobretodo, vemos por que se convierte en esa persona fria y metodica, que usa a las mujeres a su conveniencia, y que pareciera no tener sentimientos. Casino Royale podria decirse que es la primera parte de una historia divida en 2, cuya segunda parte es ""Quantum of Solace"". Recomendanda 100% para quien no la haya visto, y para quienes esten proximos a ver Quantum... Digna de tenerla en una coleccion. Y repito, Daniel Craig ES Bond... James Bond.",positive
Really like Daniel Craig as Bond. Good movie.,positive
One of the best films I have ever seen.,positive
"Perfecta. Lo siento por los puristas de Bond, pero el mito necesitaba ya una vuelta de tuerca, una dosis de ""realismo"". A mi me agrada mÃ¡s. Daniel Creig lo hace perfecto, un poco acrata, muy prepotente, con una violencia y una frialdad esperable en un agente secreto/asesino y una completa falta de estilo al vestir (que quizÃ¡ traiciona al personaje). Se acabaron el ""agitado, no removido"", las trece tias buenas por pelÃ­cula, los coches que disparan misiles, Monny Penny, las peleas sin despeinarse, el smokin impoluto, Z y otro monton de cosas icÃ³nicas del personaje. No es que estuvieran mal. Pero tampoco es grave prescindir de ellas. Fuera de los problemas de ""desmitificaciÃ³n"", un guiÃ³n bueno (con ""historia""), adaptado a los tiempos que corren y con suficiente ""oscuridades"" como para que interese mÃ¡s alla del personaje. Y no, no es Bourne.",positive
"I was unsure about Daniel Craig, but he's an incredible Bond. Director Martin Campbell did an excellent job of balancing car chases & shootouts with dialogue and plot development.",positive
One of the best Bond movies ever Craig is an awsome Bond,positive
"So, 'Casino Royale', supposedly Bond's finest hour for almost 40 years. That's a lot to accomplish, in some respects, but far easier in others. Continuing the trend of 'realistic' action and superhero movies from the mid to late '00s, 'Casino Royale' turns out to be a defining peak for several different film trends all at once. Daniel Craig is, even now, still a shock to see filling the role of 007, but it's practically a no-brainer. With his chiselled face, rippling body, believable hardman demeanor and rather surprising acting scope, Craig puts in a rare thing in a Bond film: a 'performance'. Yes, this is the main character actually being coloured in with things such as 'emotions' and 'dramatic ability', and a genuine desire to attempt be more than just and indestructable sex machine. Craig is a brilliant choice for the role and deftly mould into it, giving Bond a huge streak of cynicism and viciousness that makes him use his enormous arms to dispatch villains more than any sissy gadgets. And through it all Craig wins our respect for being so honest, not only in his character's duties but in his determination to keep Bond's new hard edge all the way through. The rest of the cast are rather bland in comparison. Judi Dench is reliable as 'M', but one gets an odd feeling of senility from seeing her transfer from a cartoonish Bond to a gritty Bond and appear unphased. Caterina Murino's 'Solange' retains a depressingly ridiculous tradition of disposable women, whilst Ivana Milicevic's 'Valenka' doesn't even qualify for the low-rank of 'Bond Girl'. The most hardworking and impressive of the cast is Mads Mikkelsen as villain 'Le Chiffre', perhaps the most unremarkable, and believeable, Bond baddie ever. Eva Green is devastatingly beautiful as 'Vesper Lynd', and, on one hand, does away with childish innuendic names and dialogue and, at times, mirrors Craig's own credible efforts at putting character into her character. Undoubtedly the most powerful moment of the entire film is a slight but touching cuddle up in the aftermath of a brutal fist-fight, looking a bit silly but flowing with all the right feelings. But then, there's an unfortunate snag that everything that makes the film appear different from previous Bonds is still based completely on the same premise and formulae. At no point do you ever expect Bond to be seriously hurt, and in an increasingly 'realistic' universe surely this only exaggerates his superhuman ability even more. The plot is still overcomplicated to an absurd degree, forgetting that a film series with staple, simple foundations need not be so dressed up in pretentious wanderings. Perhaps the biggest disappointment is Miss Lynd herself. Despite briefly touching onto bigger and more real emotions, she is still a firm cliche: showing off her 'independence' and 'feminist empowerment' early on by hating Bond for no reason, only to take an enormous dump on the whole lot by falling for him hook, line and sinker, again because of no reason. Are we really expected to believe that Bond can make people fall in love with him purely on his sex appeal? When Vesper decides to let Bond have her 'anywhere' you're wondering why the hell is she now a 7-foot quivering schoolgirl? There's one tradition that'll never go away, especially by clinging on to it with the expendable Solange in the beginning, 'departing' from previous tropes by 'reminding' the audience what used to happen. It's the script that's to blame for this stew of confusion. It nails the right amount of violence and tension in the main card game set-piece, but then flies off into familiarly stupid territory with flaccid attempts at trying to get the audience believe in the central couple, and in the leaden, expository dialogue still being trundled out in the MI6 stages. Even further, why does every British person in a Bond film have to speak in an upper-class accent? This racist stereotyping still hasn't made itself seen in front of the screenwriters. And incidentally, why are all the poker players older and uglier than Bond? Surely he can't be the only person in the world under 60 who plays poker? Aside from corrupt businessmen and underworld lackeys? The thing with all of these 'realistic' action and superhero movies is that the more they attempt to be realistic the more risible and implausible the events that take place, and audiences are even less likely to take them seriously. It's because it's not the content that needs grittying up, it's the appraoch to it, and, more importantly, the writing. Actors can act and directors can direct all they want but if the screenplay is a pretentious and childish effort to begin with then nothing will ever make the film great. So, for the record, 'Casino Royale' is indeed the best Bond film since the era of Connery, but it only serves to remind people the series could reach such heights, and is content with falling far short of them in favour of riding the current trend of 'serious' films. Movie people are so dumb.",negative
"It was good, nothing exceptional. I generally like the Bond movies since I grew up watching them. This one I almost stopped during the first half hour since I was sooo bored, and then it picked up finally. So, yeah, see it if you plan on seeing the latest one out.",negative
The opening chase scene was very muscularly done and excellent. The rest of the movie was interesting but surely would've been more so had I better understood and liked poker. Bond playing cards... and playing more cards. Hmmm...,negative
"Has some of the most stylish action sequences in any movie, bar none. Unfortunately, it drags on for way too long in the middle and lacks a satisfying climax, which keeps it from being truly fantastic. Still, the beginning half makes the entire movie worth watching.",positive
Can this be? A DECENT JAMES BOND FILM?! I'd only ever seen the ones with Pierce Brosnan before... no offense to fans but they are TERRIBLE. This... this was actually pretty darn good.,positive
"Stylish and entertaining, Casino Royale is a fresh take on the tired Bond series. Daniel Craig is probably the best bond since Sean Connery. The stunning Eva Green also gives an amazing performance as Vesper Lynd. Nothing too serious here, but when you need to lay back and whip up some popcorn this is a great movie to put on. I liked the free running at the beginning and the poker scenes were tense.",negative
"one of the best bond movies ever, and one of the best action films ever. very exciting and smart",positive
Sheerly Awesome. Nuff said.,positive
"a great action film, but not as over the top as the older bond films. the action seemed more believable, and there's more focus on Bond's Character.",positive
Me hago fan de Daniel Craig. Todos los demÃ¡s Bond parecen ridÃ­culos a su lado.,positive
this was an awesome....Daniel Craig is amazing as the new bond!!,positive
best bond movie ever.,positive
"Brillant from start to finish. From the opening scene, you know the Daniel Craigs portrayal of Bond is going to be special. Bond is ruthless and brutal, making Pierce Brosnans Bond look like Mary Poppins!",positive
"It was pretty good, great action, not a bad sroey, awsome texas holdem. It was the best bond film well 2 me anyway mostly because of the actor who plays bond. Daniel craig is the best bond in all the 007s because he isint a pretty boy, the other bonds were more smooth but not this guy, this guy is badass and thats what make this movie that much better than the other ones.",positive
A gritty throwback to the classic Bond of the 1960s and a refreshing entry into the series after a decade of sub-par Bond adventures.,positive
Love this movie. Daniel Craig is my favorite James Bond.,positive
"Only 3 things I like: Eva Green, Le Parkour dude at the start scene, & Bond's Aston Martin. The rest's just alrite.",negative
"Surprisingly thrilled by this action packed movie. I had no interest in watching it, and then after the mandatory initial car chase the rest of the movie was fantastic. Great storyline. Great characters. Great acting. Fun to watch. I would watch this again. I recommend this highly.",positive
I felt that this film is no different than watching World Series of Poker while switching to Road House during the commercials.,negative
This movie is a masterpiece of a bond film: The best bond ever!! Loved it from start to finish. Daniel is electrifying,positive
this was a very good bond flick..reminiscent of connery days.,negative
Not bad but not great!!! Too long and yes i actually fell asleep :),negative
This movie pissed exellence. The opening chase was awesome. The theme song was amazing. The poker was a great touch. Daniel Craig has become one of Bond's new faces.,positive
"Even as a die-hard old-school Connery fan, I have to admit this is the best Bond film yet.",positive
Excellent. All that you could ask for in a Bond movie. Craig is superb in this one.,positive
Daniel Craig is an appropriate fit for Bond. Set your expectations low and enjoy the movie.,negative

"Like the recent Batman movies, a great way to start anew. The performances are very good and the film is quite interesting.",positive
Sean peut aller se rhabiller !!,positive
"A great Bond film. But I must admit, I am very annoyed that they based a prequel which started in the 60's, in modern day. How can this be the story of how Bond started? The only 2 ways they can justify this is by saying they have reinvented the series or go with the Casino Royale spoof idea - many agents are called James Bond.",positive
"Sure, it may not be as ""exciting"" as other Bond films, but it's still one of the best in terms of writing. A really good movie if you pay attention.",positive
"Daniel Craig truly is a complete bad-ass. I am going back on my words because I really wanted CLIVE OWEN to play James Bond, but Daniel Craig blew me the hell away. In fact, Daniel Craig was so damn good, that I didn't even think of him as JAMES BOND during the film. He was this completely different bad-ass dude. Anyways, Casino Royale is the latest installment in the James Bond film volt. If you don't already know from the first couple of sentences of my review, Daniel Craig (Layer Cake (bad ass movie by the way!!!), Munich) takes on the Bond roll from Pierce Brosnan. This would be to Daniel Craig, what Goldeneye was for Brosnan. The Bond girl this time is Eva Green, who is EXTREMELY HOT!! She was in a film that I loved called The Dreamers. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Casino Royale's plot is actually very interesting and very confusing at the same time. This flick is actually showing you the beginning of James Bond. The actual opening scene shows him before he became a 007. It is a bad-ass scene, shot completely in black and white.",positive
Top ! Daniel Craig fantastique...,positive
"Wlecome to a new kinda Bond... and one I like ^^ I will admit, was sceptical at first but I thought Mr. Craig was a great Bond. I really enjoyed this movie",positive
"Amazing movie. Shows a more human Bond; he can miss, fail and suffer the consequences of his mistakes. Definately a change in the way Bond is portrayed.",positive
"I absolutely love the Bond and Vesper storyline..a awesome movie which bring a new flavour to the Bond films..Craig is brilliant in his role , hope to see more of him ...",positive
"Casino Royale is a 10/10 action film and Bond film. It brings the legendary character and franchise back to life after the messy Bronan 007 films. With a brilliant plot, the best Bond after connery and aw-dropping action sequences, it is the best bond film to date. At the beggining you find who Bond has just got a Licence to kill... ([url=""http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/casino_royale/""]full plot[/url]) This is the most realistic and gritty 007 film yet, which is what the genius Ian Fleming wanted. Make him proud Cambell. But it still deliveres all the villians, the mission and Bond girl's that the franchise is famous for.",positive
"I loved it! There are many reasons why. 1: It's extremely cool how they were able to put Bond in a globalized, post-9/11 world and still make it cool, slick and glamorous. 2: Daniel Craig is a beast at stunts. There were some insane chase scenes. 3: There's top-rate eye candy of both genders, including one chick who kinda looks like Penelope Cruz. 4: the villain, Le Chiffre, is totally scary, unique and classic. I mean, he weeps blood when he's nervous. How much creepier can you get? 5: Vesper. VESPER. I loved all her witty repartees with Bond, and I loved all the romance scenes with her and Bond. They had such sweet chemistry. Eva Green is unconventionally beautiful. I could never quite decide whether her face is dour and droopy or seductively sarcastic... which makes her all the more intriguing. 6: The music was awesome. 7: the cinematography was awesome. 8: The location filming was pure eye candy. Next stop, Montenegro!",positive
"en gang james bond fan, altid james bond fan",positive
"This is a brilliant rebirth for the franchise, with Craig as a tightly wound timebomb waiting to explode. It's kinetic but not frenetic. Eva Green is perfectly cast as well, as is the rest of the ensemble. It's amazing what the right cast, a good script and a well qualified director can yield, even at blockbuster proportions.",positive
Pretty good first outing for Danny.,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond yet!,positive
"There's no question Craig's Bond is more thuggish than Brosnan, and Eva Green is nice eye candy, and poker is cool, but still, it was just average for me. The movie seemed to sacrifice substance in favor of style at every opportunity - even more so than most Bond films. The ""twist"" at the end, if you can call it that (since it went totally unexplained), was pretty lame.",negative
"Liked finding out where all the Bond-isms came from. Craig is yummy, much more rugged and believable as Bond than some... If you expect all the smarminess of Brosnan's version you'll be disappointed. Consider this a prequel, people.",negative
This show's Awesome!!!,positive
Exactly the reboot Bond needed,positive
one of my fav 007 movie,positive
"Seriously, anyone who thought this movie was good, explain to me why? I seriuoly dont get these new bond movies. They are slow moving, the villians arent anything impressive, there are no gadgets and the women arent atractive. Seriously, it was like watching the world series of poker except it was fucking boring.",negative
I have seen better bond movies than this. It was a dissapointment,negative
Not a great fan of 007 movie but this one great,positive
best bond movie ever for me...,positive
"This movie was absolutely amazing, and this is coming from me! I have almost completely disliked all the previous bond movies with Pierce (Havent seen the other bonds besides the first ever one), so I did not want to see this movie despite the rave reviews. Finally I decided to watch it after the second movie already came out, and it was a damn good decision! It had everything in it- Action, suspense, romance, and comedy. Never have I laughed so hard in a Bond movie- this guy's great! Yeah, he may not look too suave or have the dark hair, but I think he's damn athletic for his age and makes Bond human. I am glad he fell in love, and I am glad he killed people and shit- It's more realistic. Now Bond isn't invincible- Things are going to get better from here on with Bond films.",positive
"The best 007 film ever along with GoldenEye, From Russia with Love, License to Kill, Thunderball and The Spy Who loved Me",positive
"Plot: James Bond's first 007 mission takes him to Madagascar, where he is to spy on a terrorist Mollaka.

"Clearly inspired by the upgraded origin of another certain spiffy-gadget-handy action hero from the year before, Casino Royale pulls the character of James Bond a-k-a Agent 007 (true personality traits still in tact) out of the sometimes fun yet often ludicrously fictional world he's grown accustomed to and introduces him to some real danger only an athletic thespian like Daniel Craig can pull off. With high risk chases after wall-jumpers atop construction cranes, stairwell fights with evil machete-clutching Ugandans, and a knack for pissing off his boss ""M"" (good ol' Dame Judi Dench returns), you almost forget at times that Bond will always be the luckiest of the ""double-zero"" super-spies - a credit to the franchise's touch-ups and director of Pierce Brosnan's first Bond film Goldeneye, Martin Campbell. While not all of the usual Bond elements exist here, there are enough necessary ones to keep the film from action film purgatory, especially the instantly classic villain Le Chiffre. The card game scenes are mostly decent for the Texas Hold 'Em informed, though the editing for poker scenes in film is always the same (The last cards shown are almost always the winning hand). If nothing else in Casino Royale helps you realize the quality of this rebooting, the finale (once the film gets around to it) should; Bond's playboy ways of one to three girls' company per mission are explained with a permanent scar of the emotional kind that's far from sappy. Cliches here and there aside, it's always nice to see Ian Fleming's boy keep up with the times.",positive
"Good, except James Bond isn't supposed to fall in love.",negative
"The plot of the movie was a bit sketchy and shaky... especially at the end. However, there's no doubt that this Bond can hold his own and the action scenes were outstanding.",positive
bad worse james bond ever.,negative
"This from someone who has practically memorized the entire Bond canon over the years--this may have supplanted ""From Russia With Love"" as my favorite. Actually, in tone, it's a lot more akin to ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service""--a much closer, more personal look at Fleming''s unstoppable secret agent. This Bond comes off a lot more complex, more human, than Brosnan did, and the result is pretty fantastic.",positive
Best Bond movie ever!,positive
"It was boring until Vesper showed up and then all of a sudden, Daniel Craig's blue eyes, blond hair, and muscles took over. ♥ Hahaha.",positive
Absolutely fantastic.,positive
"A lot of this made no sense, but Eva Green is hot.",negative
"Sad that people felt the need to reboot the Bond series. Cool action movie, but this isn't Bond",negative
"I used to like this, but I forgot all about it. That's how you describe the Daniel Craig Bond films.",positive
"i love this movie. Daniel Craig is a fantastic Bond: cocky, attractive, suave.. And of course, you can't beat a silver Aston Martin. Can't wait to see Quantum of Solace.",positive
Did live up to all the hype.,positive
"Wow. I'm pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this film! I've never seen a single Bond film until now and I LOVE LOVE Daniel Craig. This film was very entertaining, there wasn't a dull moment. The ending was pretty sad though. :'(",positive
"I never thought that the movie series could go back to the days of Goldfinger. I was wrong. Daniel Craig is definitely a Bond for the post-Bourne world. Following in the steps of Batman Begins, the story goes back to the beginning and we see a modern Bond. The action is real, fast, and the story holds throughout. It doesn't hurt that Eva Green is in the movie as well. She's great as well.",positive
First appearance of Daniel Craig and first 5 star rating for a Bond movie. The whole time I wanted to know what would come next. Absolutely fabolous !,positive
great shakes on the new bond Daniel Craig does blonde bond rather well :D,positive
"Craig is fantastic in this role, and I love the new direction of the Bond film. Finally something human, something real.",positive
I wasnt happy with it! It was boring and slow!,negative
best out of series!!!,positive
Beautiful. romantic. whatever love it,positive
"Loved the film. Fabulous special effects, good story line and lots of twists and turns you wouldn't expect. Daniel Craig does a great job as Bond.",positive
PitkÃ¤stÃ¤ aikaa hyvÃ¤ Bondi.Seuraavaa odotellessa...,positive
It's a great look at how James Bond got his start.,positive
"Disappointing to see the Bond series rebooted, but I guess audiences want to move with the time. I felt much of the classic Bond humour lost in this one but with such delicate shots, action packed fight scenes and a more emotional side of Bond, there is a lot to take in. Enjoyable nevertheless.",negative
"One of my favorite movies of all time, this movie makes Bond a physical, kickass individual aswell as very intelligent. I love it, Guns, Poker, Girls, and Aston Martin DB9, if it could be any better i dont want to know about it!",positive
"I was pleasantly surprised by the new Bond. I didn't think he had enough sex appeal, but by the end I was hooked. I really enjoyed this movie.",positive
what can i say daniel craig is the best bond ever he's a badass and this movie couldn't be any better the action is top notch and the poker scene is badass the romance was very strong and it ended really sweet too so i haven't seen every bond film known to man but this one probably is one of the top bests ever,positive
This is a great revival for the Bond series. Daniel Craig gave the role a new meaning and did a great job.,positive
awesome awesome awesome!!! hes so sexy ;),positive
Craig steps up and makes it his own!! Great script. It seems the Bond movies that remain true to the books are winners!!,positive
I did not like it. Maby I will give it another go.. sometime.,negative
Good to see the Bond series moving on to something more than an overdose of mindless action and use of gadgets so outrageously. The plot was very unexpected and superb... but it needs to keep the melodrama and spiderman antics (the opening chase) in check..,positive
i still have to say jason bourne kicks james bond ass anytime,negative
"Nice twist at the end. Daniel Craig is a rougher Bond, less sophisticated than previous 007's.",negative
"I loved this movie. The first action sequence was phenomenal, and Daniel Craig is the best. He has the right combination and he's not cheesy like past Bonds.",positive
Disapointed. This is not a Bond movie.,negative
"By far the best Bond ever made, with Craig as the best actor to ever play Bond. Honestly this movie is pretty much flawless.",positive
"Million times better than Quantum of Solace - there is actually a plot, character interaction and you can follow the action sequences. Daniel Craig is hot!",positive
Bond needs to learn how to freestyle walk.,positive
"I'm a bond fan so yeah, and this movie just takes Bond to a more raw level, awesome",positive
Grate but where are all the bond gadgets,positive
A great action movie with a Bond who is redefined. Eva Green was incredibly hot and she created an excellent romance. Also a compelling story,positive
Great move for new Bond fans and old.,positive
"An action movie, perfect for the 007 fans. I should admit that Craig is more human the Brosnan.",negative
Probably the best bond since the Sean Connery ones,positive
"Alun takaa-ajokohtaus nosti odotukset korkealle, mutta eipa ne lopulta tayttynyt. Bond-leffaksi todella tylsa, keskittyi liikaa vain yhden pokeri-pelin ymparille. Kunnon ammuskelu jai puuttumaan, samoin ajoneuvo-kohtaukset. Eva Green oli varsin nayttava ja ennenkaikkea perinteinen Bond-tytto, joka ei heilunut aseet kadessa ja tappanut pahiksia, ehdoton plussa. Daniel Graig oli Bondina muuten hyva, muttei vaan yksinkertaisesti nayta yhtaan Bondilta. Monien mielesta kaikkien aikojen paras Bond-leffa, mutta eipa tuota oikein edes tunnistanut Bondiksi. Muutettiin peruskonseptia liikaa kun yritettiin uudenaikaistaa Bondia.",negative
I think Daniel Craig makes a fantastic James Bond!,positive
"A sensible Bond film? Bloody hell, who'da thunk it?",negative
this was a really good movie. and he is really sexy. great stunts and great costume designers for daniel craig. sexy sexy movie.,positive
Wow! Daniel Craig!!!,positive
"Am not a big fan of agent 007, but this time i REALLY loved it, watching James Bond as a real, normal human being feels good :D",positive
this james bond is a loser in the movie :o) james bond was more like a CID who knows kungfu and gambling before he became the real cool 007,negative
I find James Bond films rather dull; this one is no exeption.,negative
"what a great intro to a line up of exciting classics! as if bond needed to get any better? the first time i watched it though it dragged for me... but at home it was and knowing some of the out comes, i could stay engaged and follow the interesting plot a lot better [subtitles did help]",positive
"Daniel Craig is a powerhouse James Bond in the 2006 remake, but of course can never replace Sean Connery!",positive
"Lovely to see Bond as a newbie who screws up a few times. Great story, except he was an idiot to fall for the girl at the end.",positive
"Both of Craig's Bond movies were less colourful than Moore's or Connery's. The emotional side/characterization wasn't bad, but the action/suspense/dialogue wasn't much. Christians will be relieved to know it lacked a sex scene. 6 out of 10.",negative
I was never a huge Bond fan...until this film came out.,positive
"just a god awful bond movie. one of the worst i've seen, the poker makes it dull, slow and the action sequences tried to even this out too much. daniel craig just does not do bond justice and does not play a convincing bond to me as connery or brosnan do.",negative
Volim gledat James Bonda a ovaj film mi je bas super... Gledala sam ga i prije i bilo mi je osvjezenje pogledat ga opet,positive
"He does not look like James Bond, but he played the role well. Pretty good film.",positive
"I wanted to see this before heading off to see the latest one. It was as I expected, but slow in parts, where Bond was supposed to be portrayed as a relationship man. Don't we count on him to play the field?",negative
i soo love this guy!,positive
"Probably my favorite Bond film. The action is great, Craig is perfect in the role, the story is involving and intelligent.",positive
The film that will regenerate the Bond franchise. Craig absolutely sizzles (eg. f**k off Brosnan) and Eva Green consigns the Aston Martin to second in the beauty stakes. Brilliant.,positive
Daniel Craig is bad ass,positive
Great movie!!! A lot of action.,positive
I finally got around to watching this. I wasn't sure if I'd like Daniel Craig as Bond. I was happy to see he completely reinvents the character and this is exactly what the franchise needed.,positive
Just not the same as the classics... But still pretty good.,negative
"I have broken my long standing tradition of obliviously missing the ""standards"" of movie watching... and watched my first James Bond movie. It was fun. The mushy stuff was a little too wet and moist for me?! I wish I cried blood. My official synopsis is James Bond is not as good as Die Hard.",positive
One of the best movies,positive
This reinvents Bond in a brilliant new way! You hear that Bond producers?!? Don't screw with it!,positive
Big change. Not really a good or bad change. The witty comments are gone as is the straight forward storylines. This one tends to take a bit longer for the whole story to become clear. A few gadgets. The action is definitly still there.,negative
"casino royal,cm 1 kata,TOP. ne film keren bgt deh. bikin kita terkager kaget. kaget nya ga cuma sekali. lebih dari dua kali. durasinya lumayan panjang. sampe sempet mikir,duh biz ini pasti selse. taunya salah. masih panjang critanya,hahaha.. makanya jadi terkaget kaget. critanya keren. gambarnya ok punya. kita juga disuguhi hal2 canggih sama bintang2 yg cakep2,haha.. walopun durasinya lama,ga bakal bosen de. wajib tonton,hehe",positive
"Casino Royale (and I'm talking about the official 2006 one) was the first Bond movie to feature Daniel Craig as Bond. He's the best Bond in the series so far; he's tough and he isn't so gaga for the girls. This movie leaves you hanging, and needs to have a sequel: Quantum of Solace. [img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/statusicon/forum_new.gif[/img][size=4]FRESH![img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/statusicon/forum_new.gif[/img][/size]",positive
"A whopping defibrilator kick to the Bond series. This is a level of craftmenship in a film the Bond series has never seen. There are so many sequences from this film that deserve a place in action movie history; the foot chase to the Mbutu Embassy, the knife fight in the Bodyworks exhibition, the airport, the torture scene, the list goes on but I think it's the film's elequant subtleties, like Bond preparing to return to the poker table after his stairway fight, that elevate the film to cinematic brilliance.",positive
"Brilliant, darker and much tougher new reincarnation of the mythical secret agent, which the 007 saga had been needing for a long time! Breathtaking chase and action sequences, and great story (although Vesper's betrayal/suicide at the end didn't make much sense); also, the poker match dragged on for at least 10-15 minutes too long, but apart from these 2 minor flaws, an almost perfect Bond film!",positive
Terrorists use poker for world domination? Note to self: Learn to play poker.,positive
"good. nice action scenes. like one freakin long foot chase, it was wicked. little unrealistic how Bond escapes death over and over again lol",negative
"One of the best Bond movies out there, and a great restart to a tired, dying, series. Not perfect however, as it ran WAY too long and felt like two separate movies spliced together to form one long movie, also some of the CGI looks REALLY fake in the car chase scene toward the end. To the point where I was laughing at how fake it looked. Craig surpasses expectations as Bond though and really makes the role his own.",positive
love daniel craig hot..,positive
Friggin' great James Bond film. Lots of action. Daniel Craig is dreamy. The location of the ending was a little too over the top for me.,positive
this is a great movie i thought think the new bond is more fitting for todays standards however i thought they tried to hard to keep the movie lengthy and it felt very drug out but other than that it was great,positive
"One of the best Bond movies made, simply because Daniel Craig made Bond real and he provides the edginess that Bond should have.",positive
"don't have a problem with daniel craig as bond, but i was hoping for more from the director of my fav bond movie, goldeneye. i thought the ""beginning"" of bond could have been made much more compelling and interesting. oh well.",negative
"Not so attractive to me anyway, whichever the plot, the bond lady and etc..",negative
I needed a catch up to see Quatum of Solace. http://iulen.blogspot.com/2006/12/casino-royale-el-nuevo-james-bond.html,positive
Bond as he should be,positive
Just watched this film and it was a lot better than what I was expecting. I was never a big bond fan but this fil was great - I cannot wait for Quantum of solace,positive
"Combining Bond with Jason Bourne was the perfect way to revitalize a dying franchise. Picking Casino Royale as the backstory also made for a hit due to the public's fascination with high-stakes poker. I enjoyed Eva Green's and Jeffrey Wright's characters immensely, and thought the action and settings were quintessential Bond. Well-directed and styled.",positive
not enough action but still good,positive
"You have to take a double take when you look at the poster. Is this really Sean Connery or are my eyes playing tricks on me? Well, yes and no. James Bond is back and it is like the whole Roger Moore Years hadn't even happened. THis is the real James Bond. A James BOnd that is more direct from Flemings original page than a suave cocktail host who carries a gun. You are mesmorized by how Bond Copes with killing people for his first, second, and third time in this story and how he deals with the double cross. Just an amazing film.",positive
"Quite honestly the best Bond movie I've ever seen. Daniel Craig is second only to possibly Sean Connery as the best Bond. He owns the screen and kicks ass left and right throughout the movie. But the real reason this is the best Bond movie is the story. It took me a couple of times to get everything that goes on. Repeat viewings offer something more that I didn't notice the previous time, and that, in my book, makes a great movie.",positive
"I luv action movies. this is the only james bond movie that ive seen the whole thing. its so good, and the ending rox!",positive
"I'll give it 4 because..i'm not a huge fan of James Bond. But this movie is well done, and i love Daniel Craig's version of James Bond. Much younger and definitely sexier!...I like the idea that he actually does get injured and humiliated at some points. Good action flick :).",positive
"[9/10] The best Bond film since ""Goldfinger"". Stripped directly to the bone of its basics, the real, leaner, meaner, younger, and more brash James Bond is revealed through his first mission, here. A terrific performance by Daniel Craig proves that he is perhaps the best Bond since Sean Connery, something other actors have tried but came close. With great supporting actors, and a few, but still extremely well-directed action sequences, Casino Royale gets its place as an intelligent, character-driven espionage thriller with heart.",positive
really enjoyed this movie better than i expected,positive
"A solid and refreshing revamping of the Bond franchise. Brings the darkness of the books to the screen as intact as it probably could. Will be interesting to see how long they can keep this going without people getting bored with the serious tone. For now, its great.",positive
"Y ya que estamos he de destacar que este James Bond es interesante en cuanto al giro que dan del personaje. En este caso es un novato recien entrado al servicio secreto; da la impresion de ser un expresidiario, hiperviolento, sin clase y sin tacto, pero con un potencial que lo hace meritorio de servir a la Corona. Nos insinuan de donde sacan a los agentes 007, las secuencias son alucinantes y vertiginosas, y las peleas mas sangrientas. Me encanta la participacion de Eva Green en el papel de la chica Bond.",negative
"I actually thought it was very good. Like a lot of people, I was a bit apprehensive at the thought of Daniel Craig as James Bond (mainly because of the blonde hair =D), but he does pull the legendary Bond character off really well. Can't wait to see Quantum of Solace.",positive
"I am sorry, I felt sleep......I do not know why.... I will revenge someday.",negative
Better than I expected. Daniel Craig makes a pretty decent Bond. The parkour scene with Sebastien Foucan was off the hook. -.5 star for cheesy product placement.,negative
"It was a bit too long, but OMG, Daniel Craig is a sexy mancake!",positive
"Eh. I have to admit to never being particularly drawn to the Bond series, but having heard that Daniel Craig delivers the best Bond since Connery (which I sadly admit I've never seen), I thought I'd give it a go. I will say that the stunts, all performed by Craig, himself, were amazing. The actor definitely puts his body ""through the ringer"" in this film. And Craig definitely has the handsome factor. He positively smolders. But in the end, the whole movie felt rather 'blah' to me. And the whole love story break down toward the end was absolutely atrocious and unnecessary and ended up drawing out the ending. Especially when the direction of the plot was rather transparent. I also had a hard time swallowing Eva Green as a Bond Girl. I mean, aren't Bond girls supposed to be ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom, drop-dead gorgeous, beauties? I was disappointed, but not to the point I wouldn't be willing to give Craig, and the series another shot.",negative
loved the new james bond!!!! totally excellent movie,positive
Daniel Craig just might be the best Bond ever! Sorry Sean,positive
Pretty good movie. A lot of drinking and sex stuff though. :(,positive
Yup. Still the definitive Bond flick for me.,positive
David Craig can NEVER be Bond.,negative
JB's got the edge back. DC is second only to SC,negative
"this is the only bond i want to know and the writing was just perfect, nothing too cheesy, just good gritty action with a tragic love affair and an oh so beautiful man in a suit",positive
"Too romantic & Green, geeze, stop grimacing woman!",negative
best bond film ever made. i love the idea of puting him in the real world. it works!,positive
James Bond is better than ever. After the Connery films I didn't really like James Bond that much. But Craig is probably a better Bond than Connery. He brings the original Ian Fleming Bond to life better than anyone else. He feels human and the story is fantastic. This is a masterpiece and a work of art. The 2nd best film of 2006. And the best Bond film ever.,positive
"I thought it was a brilliant comeback for the bond series, the poker scenes were occasionally boring, but the camera angles at least kept it very engaging. I enjoyed this movie mostly because they took a new angle on the series and the action scenes were very good.",positive
best bond for a while,positive
This may sound cliche but here it goes: Bond is back and better than ever! There I said it.,positive
"Fantastic. Deep, complex, and yet filled with enough action that it's fun. Just see it. You'll understand why people love Bond.",positive
"Casino Royale is a dramatic change from any James Bond movie ever made. No clever remarks after dispatching a villain, very few gadgets, no womanizing, etc. Martin ampbell pulls it off brilliantly and breathes fresh air into a franchise that has been going downhill since Goldeneye. Daniel Craig proves to be a kick ass Bond, and plays him very seriously. I've always thought that the opening sequence is one of the most important aspects of any Bond installment, and I have to say, Casino Royale has the best opening sequence of any Bond movie.",positive
Great movie. Daniel Craig makes an excellent Bond. Keep em coming.,positive
good movie nice action,positive
Ese Daniel patea traseros,negative
"This was complete awesomeness. I mean, this Bond was great, it made him an equal to that Bourne guy. Plus, it was a great reboot of the series.",positive
excellent reboot of bond.,positive
"This is the Bond we know and love - unfortunately, I saw this after ""Quantum"" - which would have made that dreary flick a little easier to handle. A more sophisticated and delightful to watch than it's sequel, there is still a departure away from beautiful broads and gadgets that the aforementioned steers further afar from. More grisly and violent, this new take on Bond is acceptable because the lead actor is good, the villains and support are good, and there are interestig chase and fight sequences (unlike - very much - the sequel). I prefer Bond with lots of toys and chasing crooks on the moon - but this wasn't all that bad.",negative
"So awesome to see Bond done so seriously, with fantastic pacing, plot and character development, music, incredible action, and a historically, yet bookwise accurate, atypically sad ending (not forgetting Bond's wife getting killed in On Her Majestyâs Secret Service). Bond RULES!",positive
Classic bond from start to finish with a tragic end and gristly torture scene that gives the franchise a dark new feel.,positive
esta buena la pelicula... pero no me gusta el final,negative
"Shaken, not stirred. The best Bond movie in my book...",positive
"was never a bond film fan but got into this, a bit of a tricky story to start with but great when it gets going, great movie",positive
AMAZING action stunts and ...body!,negative
omg! i love this movie! one of my fav!,positive
"Speaking of, I didn't like this movie but my twin and I make fun of it a lot.",negative
Amazing action sequences and beautiful cinematography... plus a great story. Finally! A Bond movie I can take seriously... without the corniness of the previous Bond movies.,positive
Loved it!! Was really skeptical after all not Pierce Brosnan but this was a great movie and I love his versiopn of Bond! Cannot wait for the next one!,positive
Really great Bond movie. Well worth the money I spent on the DVD.,positive
"This new Bond was too tough and had no emotions at all. He didn't even say the ""shaken not stirred"" line instead he said ""I don't give d***!"" which was very disappointing. I think this new Bond guy needs to lighten up a little and learn to laugh.",negative
this bored the hell out of me and i fell asleep for most of it.,negative
I saw Quantum Of Solace before I saw it's predecessor and now I have to retract my afformentioned praise of that being the best Bond flick for Casino Royale. Craig is by far the best Bond and the pardigm for the best interpation of the character in the novel despite his Orkish appearence. It had an overall harder edge and realistic feel from any other Bond film which didn't detract from its aesthetic of beautiful scenery that most come to expect with a 007 flick. Overall sold performances by all. Vesper was pretty easy on the eyes and had that swanky British charm.,positive
Daniel Craig was brill,positive
This film reeeally impressed me. Both Daniel Craig and Eva Green are fantastic.,positive
This is back to what Bond should be.,positive
Greatest movie of my life~,positive
"Good movie, but the poker scene in the middle of the movie makes it seem kinda boring, but in all a good movie.",negative
"Yowza wowza! The opening sequence was awesome! I remember that my husband (not a Bond addict) turned to me and gave me a high five. It is still one of the best chase scenes I have watched. I liked the character development. Thought the plot was interesting. This is not your classic James Bond but I found that I prefer that. I like Pierce Brosnan as an actor and thought he would be the best Bond yet but his suave, oh so British, oh so teflon portrayal of Bond was old by his last movie. Prefer him in other things. This new Bond is rough and makes mistakes. Well, if he's just become a 007 then that would make some sense. I'm not trying to win anyone over to the Daniel Craig side. I know people have their Bond favorites. PS that water shot, you know the one, holly crap! My husband can love the cars, I'll love those abs.",positive
Easily as good as some of the classic Connery Bond films. Craig definantly takes second to Connery in the Bond hierarchy. This one is definantly more of a modern spy film than the sometimes over the top Bond movies.,positive
"Very good. A great re-vamping of the Bond film with a nice new twist: he's not James Bond yet. And that's why I accept the absence of many classic Bond elements. It's his rough journey to become the 007 we all know and love, and the film has plenty of action, a great actor playing Bond, and a good villain. My only beef: the longest poker game ever. Enough, we get it.",positive
rreeaallyy good movie,positive
"My favourite Bond film of all time. Daniel Craig is perfect for the role and brings a raw, gritty and rougher edge to the character that's been missing for me. The Stunts were unbelievable and really made this film a pleasure to watch. The bomber chase scene was an incredible and impressive feat for not only the director but for the freerunner involved. What a great fucking movie all around. My only low point in this movie was the longer then necessarily love ending which could have gotten it's point across in less time and saved the yawns.",positive
"Excellent bond film, Craig has a great future as the new Bond. The movie is a provocative adrenaline filled thrill ride. The characters and memorable and the plot keeps you guessing till the end.",positive
"A pretty good Bond movie, but still probably unfaithful to the books.",negative
Finally saw it to prep myself for Quantum of Solace. Actually was quite impressed with Daniel Craig.,positive
"Never really seen any Bond movies before, loved this movie.",positive
"This is the best James Bond movie since ""You Only Live Twice"" with Sean Connery. Daniel Craig is the first Bond since Connery who actually looks like he could throw a punch. Casino Royale has just the right mix of dark grittiness and suave James Bond flair. My only complaints were that the poker sequence ran a little long and I didn't understand why Bond couldn't just kill the bad guy instead of beating him in poker.... Maybe I shouldn't ask too many questions and just enjoy the show!",positive
i don't know. it's a pretty good action movie but it's nothing like bond. he has none of the cool gadgets and charisma. i guess i was just hoping for a real bond movie and not another Die Hard imitation.,negative
Daniel Craig is the Best Bond!,positive
"How do I feel about this? Bloody Hell! How the hell am I supposed to know what the hell is happening when everything's gone to hell and no one can tell me what the hell is happening or why the bloody hell... Well, to be honest, I was expecting something a little less hokey. I mean, if someone poisons you...just because you shock yourself doesn't mean the poison is suddenly GONE. Spent half the damn movie wondering when we'd actually see a casino. Still. Craig is...well, Craig is hot. So...there you go. Problems solved. And once again, a complete waste of Jeffrey Wright's talent.",negative
This is one of the best films in the series and my favorite Bond film since Goldfinger. Daniel Craig explodes onto the screen and Martin Campbell returns as director (he directed 1995's Goldeneye.),positive
Out of all 22 Bond Movies this is in my opinion one of the top 3 James Bond movies...Daniel Craig really plays his role well which is a relief to all Bond fans...,positive
"I haven't seen many Bond movies so it's hard to compare. Nothing that special for me, watchable.",negative
An actually really good movie. Daniel Craig is both cool and hilarious as James Bond in the beginning. The first James Bond movie I've ever seen and I am so glad I wasn't disspointed. Very exciting and chilling.,negative
I watched it again to fill in forgotten references in Quantum of Solace. An otherwise excellent picture ruined by soap in the last half hour.,negative
"I like the new Bond, but he's not the best of the bunch.",negative
"Good action flick bad bond movie, I am sorry but Daniel Craig is just not a conviencing bond, he lacks the charisma.",negative
"Good pace, good plot, good movie. For those who want to see another side of Bond. james Bond.",negative
"Despite the many reservations of having Craig play 007, he does a fantastic performance in his first outing.",positive
After a second viewing I realised that the script sucked badly. It was still a pretty enjoyable popcorn muncher though.,negative
back to the old bond.. its difficult to accept him as the bond after brosnan but this guy sure reminds you of Sean connery as the bond..,positive
i think this JamesBond is funny lol. hahaha.,positive
"James Bond-elokuvat ovat olleet pitkÃ¤Ã¤n laskusuunnassa ja kokeneet todellisen inflaation sitten Conneryn aikojen. Craigin Bond tuo uskon itse hahmoon, joka on Bond-elokuvissa se tÃ¤rkein elementti. Casino Royalessa Bond on inhimillinen, haavoittuvainen, brutaali, suoraviivainen, tumma, synkkÃ¤, moderni ja ennen kaikkea sÃ¤rmikÃ¤s ja katu-uskottava!!! Daniel Craig on minunnÃ¤kÃ¶iseni Bond ja palauttaa uskon hahmoon vÃ¤littÃ¶mÃ¤sti. Itse leffa sisÃ¤ltÃ¤Ã¤ kaikki herkulliset Bond-kliseet ja rajoja rikkovia kohtauksia. Bond, My name is James Bond-repla lÃ¶ytyy, mutta Martinia ei enÃ¤Ã¤ sekoiteta, upeaa!!! Leffa sisÃ¤ltÃ¤Ã¤ upeita takaa-ajoja, kauniita naisia, vittumaisen vihulaisen, oikeanlaisen huumorin sekÃ¤ oikeassa suhteessa toimintaa.

"I enjoyed it thoroughly. There was some quite awesome action sequences, my personal favorite being the free running scene at the beginning. This is how Bond should be. Gritty and real. it works better for the character from the book. Bond is void of any emotions, being suave and persuasive while still being a cold hearted killing machine at the same time. I think Daniel Craig has played the character the best since Sean Connery.",positive
"Finally, no dumb campy stuff. YAY! I can watch bond films again.",positive
"A Just ok bond, hard plot to follow but in the end of course James gets the job done!!",negative
"Bond goes back to basics - tight storyline, good action sequences, intriguing Bond girl and memorable villian. After the Bronsan years it is good to have a Bond more believable and not a prettyboy. Ranks #3 on the all time official Bond films.",positive
Probably amazing. Only second to the new 007,positive
"Daniel Craig could very well be the logical successor to Sean Connery as Bond. Great movie, and loved the Chris Cornell tune ""You Know My Name"".",positive
"Good Bond flick, Daniel Craig makes a much tougher bond than Pierce Brosnan.",positive
"A tight, back-to-basics approach to 007 that works extremely well, thanks to Craig and previous Bond resuscitator Martin Campbell.",positive
"Different spin on an old character...I especially enjoyed the ""cardiac arrest"" scene.",positive
"A nice, entertaining movie. Definitely worth seeing. As in every movie, James bond gets in a relation with his partner. The movie obviously made lots of advertising for Sony. The actress is pretty !",negative
what a james bond film should be.... although the casino bit was a bit long...,positive
"I was scared when this movie came out. Scared that for the first time in my life, I would hate James Bond. Sure, there are a few Bond MOVIES I hate, but never Bond himself. What a pleasant surprise! Obviously, the folks at Bond's franchise-long studio, Pinwood, took some notes while they were making The Bourne Ultimatum. The newly reincarnated Bond is a fair rival to his brother across the pond! (Still, Clive Owen would've been the perfect new Bond, had the producers used their better judgment.)",positive
I like this more as an action movie than a bond film. Some things were just dumb and some stuff just was awesome. The awesome stuff outweighs the dumb in this case. I like watching this movie on an occasional basis.,negative
Best Bond ever. Who would have thought to make a character-driven movie about Bond after so many increasingly weak plot-driven pseudo-star vehicles?,positive
Daniel Craig. Need I say more?,positive
"Probably the best bond movie of the franchise. Daniel Craig is the best bond yet and we begin to see a more realistic and human Bond. Dark, gritty, and real Casino Royale marks the beginning of excellent change for the 007 Franchise.",positive
Astonishing. Not quite as good as Quantum of Solace. But still an amazing movie with great action.,positive
Best Bond movie to come out since Golden Eye,positive
"It was not like I thought it was, it has developed in another direction.",negative
The Bond movies were hopelessly getting more and more absurd. Thank you Daniel Craig for saving 007 from getting ridiculous.,positive
One of the best James Bond movies I've ever seen. Daniel Craig fills in nicely as the new Bond. It was like he was born to play the character. The movie was not only good on the action but was heavy on the plot as well. A great balance of action and plot. I would definitely recommend it.,positive
"Tres bon James BOnd et malgrÃ© les mauvaises critique sur l'acteur principal, moi je trouve Daniel Craig tres bon dans ce role.",positive
vale 5 stelline solo per lui qnd esce dall'acqua con il costumino azzurro.....,negative
"Okay I finally watched this movie. I've been avoiding it because I'm sick to death of James Bond. Talk about your tired franchise. Someone just shoot the guy for crying out loud. if I see one more movie that boils down to a ticking time bomb I'm gonna gouge my eyes out. HOWEVER... this movie was terrific! Excellent story, and some of the best fight scenes I've ever seen. Daniel Craig brings a fantastic and BELIEVABLE new edge to Bond. Loved it!",positive
"Better than expected, has its moments, but overall, not entirely thrilled. Far better than its follow-up. 3.75+ PS. Banlieue 13 (District B13) has a great parkour scene too (even better in my opinion).",positive
After a friend reccomended it I gave in and watched it (after all she was right about POTC) and I saw it and I absolutley loved it despite it being out of my favourites. Very good movie.,positive
Lots of action. Fair amount of humor.,positive
"WTF.... no gadgets, no Q. Bond stops being a ladies man and instead is a coky prik without emotion and the film is a way too long card game without a lot of action. I know they were trying to reinvent Bond... but I think they could have done better",negative
The best Bond movie ever. Brings a gritty real life feel to it.,positive
"This Bond film was absolutely amazing, and had a great story and a wonderful bond girl who is played by beautiful Eva Green. Daniel Craig is one of the best Bonds ive ever seen. But Sean Connery is classic, nobody can pass him...Sorry to say...",positive
Beautifully shot! The right choice for Bond and the right script to start over a new. I couln't find fault with this one. And James and Vesper go down in movie history as one of the greatest love stories of all time.,positive
What an amazing movie. At the edge of my seat. Great performance by Daniel Craig as 007. Another amazing performance by Giancarlo Giannini who I have to say is an Italian...just like me.Very sad ending though. I loved this movie.,positive
"As a Bond myself, I endorse this movie whole-heartedly.",positive
"An excellent example of ""rebooting"" a franchise, Casino Royale is the best Bond film in decades and a damn well good action movie. The somewhat silly lead-up to the conclusion keep me from giving this a 5 stars, but it honestly deserves much praise.",positive
"Exactly the direction the franchise needed to take. The set pieces while not as elaborate as the films predesessor are ultimately more interesting and the action is more gritty and even frightening at times. No more Money Penny, no more ridiculous sounding Bond Girl names. Daniel Craig may possibly be the greatest Bond of all time. Bond has grown up finally after 45 years.",positive
"the best bond action movie ever. this version of bond's character is much darker; the movie as a whole is much darker than the previous one's. Craig plays a tougher yet more vulnerable bond. the action scenes are beyond spectacular. Eva Green left a lasting impression, Craig is a unique bond, his bond cannot be compared with Brosman. All in all a fresh new darker style of Bond, away from the fancy gadgets and more rugged fighting scenes.",negative
Thank God...Craig made Bond a man again.,positive
One of the best 007 movie ever... Just perfect.,positive
"I now see why Casino Royale is single-handedly responsible for breathing life back into a dying series. After seeing Quantum of Solace and then Casino Royale, I understand why the sequel is widely regarded by many as a shitsplosion compared this well-written and brilliantly acted Bond film.",positive
Simply awesome. Very well shot. Some of the best action I've seen on the screen in a while. And I never knew a poker game could be so intense or action packed on screen.,positive
the new era begins.......and its legen...wait for it....dary. A modern day bond classic...without too much special effect...good story..not losing touch with reality....and overall we see a new bond with a menacing attitude and a broken hrt.....i never expected so much frm a bond movie before this.,positive
reinvented the series by going back to the grittiness of the original books. Craig is perfect.,positive
"O bom: Craig e' o melhor Bond de sempre, cenas de accao realistas, muito bem feito. O mau: nada. A conclusao: grande recomeco da saga James Bond.",positive
This was not Bond. The Action was limited. Bond was humorless. Gadgets were nonexsistent.,negative
yeah this is probably my fav bond flick,positive
Definately one of the best James Bond movies ever made. Loved it,positive
"Entretenida, sin aliento, con un Craig que sale espectacular. James Bond del bueno, del estresante, con golpes, amor, poker, martinis... Y con un toque diferente. Me entretuvo mucho",negative
"Love the non-stop action on this movie, not that much the movie being never-ending, but it was a cool film.",positive
"After watching Quantum of Solace, I went back to this Bond film. The new James Bond has all the elements of the previous James Bond films: girl, action and the exoticism, what makes it different is that James Bond is now in flesh and blood, not just a hollow perfect model anymore.",negative
A very good job by Craig to play as Bond. I've never been much of a fan of the series. Though this being the beginings I have to say I am now a fan. The darker approach and more mordernized weaponary is a plus too. That's what really turned me off about hte past films with all the futuristic stuff. A good love story too and I pray to God I never met a Vesper of my own. =),positive
I really enjoyed this movie. I think the opening chase scene was incredible.,positive
Fantastic reboot of Bond. Has what is probably my favorite Bond opening.,positive
"Very good. Daniel Craig does a good job as Bond, and it is interesting to see the character in this different light. One of the best parts was the opening scenes. It is a little slow in the end, but the last scene is wraps up the movie very well.",negative
"Good, good, good. Solid acting, solid action, solid movie. watch it.",positive
Cant Beat it. Intro was great. DANIEL CRAIG in swim short wooooo :D always loved james bond Daniel craig is the best :D and the hottest :D,positive
"Le moins bon des James Bond Ã  mon sens. Pas assez d'action, pas assez dans la veine habituelle,...",negative
The beginning action scene is amazing! Great casting as well. But that's about it. I couldn't picture Daniel Craig as Bond. He was a much better action star in the movie Layer Cake.,negative
"This was one of the best Bond flicks ever. Casino Royale was the first of the re-launched 007 franchise, and it's done the 007 title justice. This is not your type of Bond your parents and grandparents grew up with. Daniel Craig did an outstanding job bringing the Bond character to life, and making him up to date. He's tougher, meaner, and gritty. If Batman Begins taught us anything about re-launching a franchise, its that characters like these are best when inflicted with real world down to earth issues and action. Bond had the right amount of lavishness, elegance, and ass kicking it needed to be deemed the greatest Bond film. Unfortunately, I haven't seen the sequel ""Quantum of Solace"" yet. But when I do, I know I will be completely satisfied.",positive
i dont really like james bond films all that much but this one i heard was very good. i went in there with high expectations. the beginning wasn't intriguing to me but as i watched more and more the more interesting it got. the suspcion and confusion arose. i'm glad they didn't use pierce brosnan again because i'm sorry but he's too old. daniel craig was a refresher and the dialogue between him and the girl was funny and witty. i like when not really famous actors play well known characters.,negative
"The intro was great, the poker was great, but who was the villain? Does anyone know? Oh yeah he was that guy right at the end who..who was he again? Have to wait and see Quantum of solace lol. Good bond movies need a good villain. Le Chifre was fantastic but how weak was his death?",positive
The Greatest Bond film ever.,positive
oooh WOW it was 1 of the greatest james bond movie i've ever seen and i cant wait 2 watch quantum of solace the action in it was so amazing and wonderful and plus daniel craig is 1 of my fav actor ever <3,positive
"Daniel Craig is, in my opinion, the best bond so far... of coarse I'm not looking for the charm which the other gender looks for in a bond character.",positive
one of my favorite films ever.,positive
Watch it again just to see how good it is.,positive
Amazing movie. the best 007 ever.,positive
Great return to reality fo Bond! Loved the action sequences. The swimsuit scene with Daniel Craig did not hurt either!,positive
The best of the Bond films. I wasn't really a fan of the series until this one came out. It redifined the character into a bad ass agent. Craig is by far the best bond ever.,positive
"I understand how everyone loves the campy fun of the originals, but this Bond is what Ian Fleming had envisioned when he first wrote Casino Royale. Yes he is a darker character than we're used to but, this gives more development to the character instead of just a guy that looks good, is a spy, and can get chicks. Craig's Bond is a more realistic Bond, a more intelligent Bond. He's my new favorite. Sean Connery is and will always be the best because he started it all, but Daniel Criag has reintroduced Bond to a new generation and in a way that respects the originals, Yet stands on its own at the same time. 5/5",positive
I thought I was going to hate this Bond film. After watching it I realize the direction they were going for. I think its the best bond film ever made. Its a brilliant reinvention of the 007 franchise thats greatly welcomed.,positive
"Yes, while everyone else is out watching 'Quantum of Solace', I'm just now getting around to seeing 'Casino Royale'. Not being well-versed in the James Bond pantheon, I can't really compare it to other Bond films, but I wasn't particularly impressed with it. There are some impressive action sequences toward the beginning, and a few effective scenes; but the story is underwhelming and surprisingly dull - far too much time is spent on poker games, which is rarely very compelling on screen - on top of that, the film is just too long, especially when bogged down by some mushy love scenes toward the end. Daniel Craig is serviceable, if a bit bland, as Bond, Mads Mikkelsen is a good villain, and Eva Green adds some much-needed spark to the film. Has its moments, but overall underwhelming and disappointing.",negative
this is the best Bond so far,positive
Best Bond since Connery or Lazenby.,positive
Despite the emo scene in which a character is fully clothed and crying in a shower... and the fact that it's the highest budgeted poker movie ever... it's pretty damn good.,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever!!,positive
"I never had an interest in James Bond, but Daniel Craig changed all that. No stupid fancy gadgets or skanky women - yay!",positive
The new Bond is awesome!!!,positive
"Probably the best Bond movie of the bunch. It just seems like there's more at stake here than in any other of the films. Maybe that's because of Daniel Craig's Bond and the fact that he isn't afraid to have insecurities. Tense poker scenes and crazy actions shots, as well. Really glad they're re-imagining the series, it was completely dried out.",positive
I was one of those people who gave up on James Bond and then was one back with this one.,negative
"Entretenida... persecucion, tiros, minas, etc... de las mejorcitas de Bond.",positive
"Daniel Craig is a good actor but not as Bond. A blond Bond is hard to be love. A simple story line with no extra expectations. Car chase are kinda lame - and short. Gadgets are also lame but given it's his first mission, oklah. Overall, I just can't get it. fave scene: the first chase on foot",negative
"wow. this movie has it all. Its got action[and plenty of it],comedy,style and class.Firstly daniel craig is the best damn bond the series has seen, being perfectly able to handle the most fisically demanding of action scenes.The story is excellent with a massive plot twist near the end.The very first action sequence of the movie is breathtaking, and really shows what this new bond can do.well, anyway i have three words that pretty much sum up this review SEE THIS MOVIE.",positive
"This is a damn close to a perfect Bond film as you can get. EON productions completely revamps the franchise and delivers a knockout of a Bond movie. I admit at first I was a sceptic. I saw Daniel Craig and my mind immediately flew to Lazenby (the resemblance is still a bit disturbing) and I thought ""Oh God, this is the worst decision ever!"". But I was wrong. Craig plays James as an unfinished, brutally efficient, possibly masochistic 007 taking full advantage of his newly minted license to kill. As Dame Judy ""M"" puts it ""any thug can kill"" she expects something more from him than just raw rage, and therein lies the journey. James must go from a thug with an overdeveloped trigger finger to a smooth, suave agent capable of using more than just his muscles. The series has been ""Bourne-ified"" and let's face it, the touches are obvious, but that doesn't take away from the simple fact that this movie is poetry in motion. Beautiful, deadly, violent, and quite obviously Chauvanistic, but poetry none the less. And besides it's Bond, so it's okay to be Chauvanistic. He wouldn't be Bond if he was any other way.",positive
this was in my opinion the best bond of all time.,positive
"I can't believe I forgot to review this. The new Bond is a man who can switch from the debonair to the action hero and back again with little effort. Everything about this movie is great, and it has definitely redeemed the series after some of the more unbelievable enemies Bond faces, that were becoming something of a joke. The torture scene was funny and disturbing at the same time, Daniel and Mads making it look very convincing. Overall, one of the best Bond films, if not the best.",positive
dang dis movie was da bomb,positive
"It has great action scenes, but the plot wasn't all that...",negative
"The opening chase scene is amazing, and the title song is very good. One of the best bond films ever",positive
A great movie. Classic Bond.,positive
Best Bond Ever. Only Goldeneye is in the same league,positive
The movie that got me addicted to 007 again!!,positive
"Awesome non-stop action, a heart throb",positive
Quite a boring storyline and to be honest doesn't really make sense at all????,negative
"My favorite bond film, take a mature and slow story and makes it immediately watchable. Love it.",positive
"I may not be a good judge on who makes a good Bond because the last Bond movie I saw was ""The Living Daylights."" I never saw Pierce Brosnan as Bond. Having said that, Daniel Craig makes a great Bond - stoic, stealth, cracking armor. The action scenes were amazing. My complaint is that I didn't need to see the torture scene. It was unclear what was going on, but it appeared that his balls were being whipped. That's unpleasant, but must take good aim. I don't need to see that.",positive
"This is an effective action film. It is not a ""Bond"" fim. Here Bond is more Jason Bourne than Sean Connery. He is more a killer than a cosmopolitan. We see more of his skin than any of the ""Bond Girls."" He has a sense of humor, but it is very, very tightly wrapped. He is very immature and explosive. So if this is the ""new"" Bond, that's OK with me. It was a hell of an action flick. So keep it an action flick! The film was too long. It ground to a halt during the card game, full of every grifter cliche in the book. When it opened and ended with action, it was kick-ass. Awesome physical action and pyrotechnics. Decent plot twists and double crosses. Still, one does miss Connery's wise cracks. And his arrogance had a disarming grace to it. He didn't have to kick you in the balls with it....",negative
"A disappointing film, takes itself far too seriously and is still loaded with awful cliches. I'm still struggling to believe that the initial chase sequence wasn't intended to be comedy, the poker scenes were just irritating and the ending was poor. It didn't even have a decent Bond Girl in it!",negative
emotions dont suit The Bond..!!,negative
"As someone who would consider myself fairly well versed in the world of film, it's quite astounding that I have not been acquainted with the 007 series. And by that, I mean, well - I can't recall if i've ever seen anything except ""Goldeneye"". Something about an arrogant guy with absurd gadgets never appealed to me, nor did the overlong action sequences with cool one-liners that serve only to wink at the audience. Bond is simply not my kind of hero. The reason I sat down to watch ""Casino Royale"", however, was not only because it was considered one of the better films of 2006, but because I had been assured that this is a new Bond. A human Bond, and one that lives in a setting that somewhat appreciates the laws of physics. While ""Casino Royale"" isn't a parody of an action film like one would expect from the series, I found myself quite underwhelmed in how unconvincing this so-called ""human"" Bond was. It simply didn't work for me. Perhaps I don't have quite the frame of reference as i'm not accustomed to the sexist and uncaring Bond's of the series' past, but calling this Bond a sympathetic character is quite the stretch. An even bigger stretch, however, and ultimately the film's downfall, was how little I cared about the relationship between James and Vesper, which attempts to be the film's heart. The film, following Fleming's original novel, set out to reboot a dying franchise. And, well, it worked! Bond is hotter than ever - with ""Quantum of Solace"", this film's sequel, raking in over $70 million on opening weekend. It's no question that the series reboot was a complete success and an absolute phenomenon, which one has to assume can be placed solely on the shoulders of the wonderfully fresh and charismatic portrayal of Bond by the consistently great Daniel Craig. The plot follows the early days of James Bond (Daniel Craig), with the prologue even showing us how he acquired his ""double-o"" status (which one attains by killing two men). Bond's boss, M (Judi Dench), keeps a watchful eye over the reckless man who she feels is undeserving of his elite status. Bond's first mission leads him to a parkour footrace in Madagascar with a bomb-maker. This chase scene is just as breathtaking as the hype makes it out to be, however one really has to question why we should care. We've yet to become familiar with this Bond, and therefore we examine this scene as if it was nothing more than a masturbatory stunt show. While neat to look at, I thought it compromised the story and really put a halt on the character development - not to mention that the film become incredibly top-heavy as i'm sure a more restless audience pined for more action of this magnitude throughout the whole second act of the film. The main mission for Bond in the film is to track down men who supply millions of dollars of terrorists, primarily the devious Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) who is competing in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro. Bond enters himself into this competition in an effort to keep the money out of terrorist hands, and along the way he meets accountant Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), who becomes the love interest of the film. The middle portion of the film revolves around a poker game, which should be an easy key to creating tension, but I found it to be overwrought and uninteresting. I enjoyed one of the first hands in which Le Chiffre tricks Bond by making him believe he can spot his ""tell"", but the rest wasn't as fascinating as the film thought it was. Not only was every hand a treasure (I was expecting someone to pull out 9 or 10 aces), but I felt as though I can feel Paul Haggis' contribution to the film with the consistent stating of the obvious. There's a scene in which tensions should be rising, and director Martin Campbell keeps cutting to a conversation involving Vesper's character in which she's being told what's happening in the game. Because, you know, neither women know the audience understand the concept of poker. One of these days, i'll try and write a review of a film involving Paul Haggis without referencing my hatred of his work... but this is not that day. ""Casino Royale"" is certainly far from a bad film as it is more than competent film-making. The performances all around are wonderful, and Daniel Craig was certainly tailor made for the role of Bond. Although I had many nitpicks throughout the film, I was surprised how quickly the three hour runtime passed by. Also, as you'd expect from a blockbuster of this magnitude, the special effects and action sequences are fantastic. That being said, however, i'm not seeing the ""human"" Bond that everyone has raved about. Sure, he shows signs of normalcy, but not once did I feel he was fully three-dimensional. He's a different Bond, and certainly a better Bond, but that doesn't make him an interesting Bond. I was greatly disappointed in this, but I still might give it a very mild recommendation.",negative
"Bond, James Bond...rebooted for a new era. Bravo!",positive
if you havent seen this yet its just sad,positive
"Please pardon my involuntary vomit as I write this review. Craig isn't funny. At all. Connery had humor. Moore had (albeit too much at times) humor. Brosnan had his moments. Even Dalton had a few jokes in his first film. Craig simply doesn't fit the role of a suave, slick agent. He fits more into an action film, where a brute of a man is needed to play the agent. However, perhaps I'm just the oddball of my generation, as I think this film was marketed towards those who were not big into the legends of the past and instead wish to see 007 take on a different feel. That is certainly possible as all connections to the traditions set by the previous 20 films were shattered with this release.",negative
Not my most favorite Bond movie...,negative
tooo sexxie =] but sumhow his character seemed kind of off with everyone else,positive
I really like him as James Bond. I liked the film. Not sure why they feel they need to make James a harder/Darker character.,positive
"Casino Royale disposes of the silliness and gadgetry that plagued recent James Bond outings, and Daniel Craig delivers what fans and critics have been waiting for: a caustic, haunted, intense reinvention of 007. But scribes also note ""Casino"" is hardly morose, with enough stunning action sequences and in-jokes to please the diehards. Some pundits even go so far as to say that Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery.",positive
didnt realize it was a chic flick,negative
"Best bond ever. Craig is amazing, i want to look like him (no im not gay lol)",positive
Saw it over and over and over. Still love it.,positive
"One of my favorite movies ever, the best Bond movie. Its smart, action packed and romantic. This one makes all the other Bond movies look like spoofs of themselves.",positive
must one more time see it...,negative
Not since the Sean Connery Bond films have I seen such a wonderful and masterful vision of Ian Fleming's secret agent. this is the best Bond film and Daniel Craig is my favorite James,positive
I am a huge Bond fan and have seen every film several times. This is by far the best movie. Daniel Craig makes Sean Connery's performance feel like a parody. And it's not just mindless action. The scenes playing poker are some of the best in the movie.,positive
"Superb adaptation of the original James Bond novel, brought bang up to date and featuring Daniel Craig's first outing as 007. Rebooting the whole franchise, gone are the ridiculous stunts and baddies (as well as the Q and Moneypenny characters), and in comes a strong storyline with rounded, credible characters. Craig is a superb Bond, nailing the ice-cold ruthlessness of Fleming's original hero, who falls for Eva Green's stunning Vesper Lynd, who hides a secret or two of her own. This being an origin story of sorts, their relationship is key to the development of the Bond we know and love, and Craig and Green's performances succeed in making their romance feel quite real. The script is sharp and well-written, while Campbell's direction is glossy, taut and exciting; the only minor criticism being a slightly over-extended ending in Venice. Among several other highlights, the central card game is a memorably tense affair. Casino Royale has gone back to basics to rediscover 007, resulting in quite the best Bond film in a long time, and possibly the best one ever.",positive
a great refreshing look on the original series,positive
Daniel Craig is the most bad-ass bond ever!,positive
This movie brought James Bond back to LIFE!,positive
"For me, the best Bond ever. Yet, I was a big fan of Sean Connery, but this one is more in the reality and it does it!",positive
daniel craig wot a babe!!!,positive
It was good but not as good as everyone said it was. Craig makes an excellent bond. I thought some of the other acting was a little spotty and the poker scenes were a little over the top.,negative
"The new Mr. Bond is really brilliant in this new movie of 007, Daniel Craig is given two thumbs up!",positive
Not very impressed. Aside from the intro.,negative
beautiful baby blues couldnt turn me away!,positive
"There was a lot of blind action just to have action (not that that was entirely a bad thing). His relationships with others did seem a little forced, and the lines and exchanges of dialogue just didn't seem to have the same pizazz as the last one, it lacked its quick wit. Enemies were a nice change from the ""destroy the world"" bit though.",negative
"So amazing. Unfortunately I saw 'Quantum of Solace' before 'Casino Royale' but I definitely think that this first movie was by far better than the second - the second was still awesome, don't get me wrong - but this one had a very unique flavour to it...a MUST see for Bond lovers :)",positive
"My second viewing showed me so much more of CASINO ROYALE's greatness. Although I strongly dislike the new approach to James Bond, Daniel Craig does a marvelous job as the bitter and hard nosed agent. The scenes where he reacts to the poison really show his talent. The movie itself was good. The high intensity and fast paced action sequences(beginning chase, fighting off the guy with the sword, ending fight) were way too Bourne and not all that Bond. The poker game although long was pivotal. James and Vesper's relationship turned around extremely suddenly. Even our hero says so...""I wouldn't describe our relationship as that"" or something along those lines. Great cinematography. Real sweet Bond gear and automobile. I was sad to see the Aston Martin tumble. Despite it's flaws it's easily one of the better movies of 2006 and one of the best Bonds.",positive
"Really good, I've never like a Bond movie as much as this one. It's a bit slow at times, but well thought out and intelligent.",positive
Perfect casting choice with Daniel Craig as Bond. What a way to reboot the series.,positive
"The best Bond movie I have ever seen. Daniel Craig is fantastic, added with a compelling, developed plot, and realistic style. Also, Chris Cornell provides the greatest theme song ever!!",positive
GREAT BUT TOO LONG 4 THIS NEW BOND :),positive
brought the bond series into a whole new era.,positive
really realy really nice movie,positive
"I would go as far to say that this was one of the best bond films that has been made. Of course, with the classic Sean Connery flicks, this film gave Bond a new look. It was good to see James Bond running around and shooting people without all the rediculous gadgets. I gave up after I saw one where Q shoots a rocket out of a foot cast - Do we really need gadgets when Bond is such a bad mama jama like he is now ? I dont think so - Definitely see this film - it is amazing !",positive
"A triumph. Shaking off all the traditions and expectations that can weigh down a Bond movie (but in all honesty, I did miss some of them) and starting from scratch. Right from scratch: Casino Royale was Ian Flemings first 007 story and this is the most faithful adaptation of his work (that Iâve read) in the franchiseâs history. By putting the character first and the action set pieces second, they have given us the most compelling entry in decades. This is a Bond movie for people who say they donât like Bond movies.",positive
"This is about as near-perfect as James Bond can get. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the Brosnan era, but this film will make you realize that the road those films were heading on needed to be left fast. Daniel Craig nails the flawed, angry Bond. This Bond means business, friends, and business is good.",positive
"i wasnt expecting it to be so good! i am NOT a fan of the typical bond movies, but this one changed my mind. maybe its due to daniel craig????",positive
"Okay so I watched them out of order, so sue me. A good movie, Bond goes back to being more of a butt kicker than a gadget flinger. Much longer than the sequal.",negative
"My favorite Bond film, because he wasn't just some horny cold-hearted asshat. I hate the concept of the Bond character, this guy was something else.",positive
"Thankfully, the filmmakers who made this have pulled it off with class and heart. The action sequences - several of which, are truly amazing. Daniel Craig is a beast.. yea, he is.",positive
"Very good, a more intense Bond mixed with Die Hard (in the sense that if you hit him he bleeds). And I know its not going to be another borne identity because you seen one borne you seen them all. Bond is better.",positive
"It's a very well done Bond film. But I think I'm over Bond. Bourne is one thing... Bond, especially in this flick, is a little too quick to kill people for no reason. Cold-hearted. Prefers to sleep with married women. Just not the kind of protagonist I want to shell out $10 for.",negative
"By now, probably everything has been said about this movie, I just saw it in preparation for the new Quantum of Solace. Great photography, not an specially good soundtrack on the DVD",positive
Didnt want Daniel Craig as James Bond but he has one me over & I think he could even end up better than Sean Connery,positive
"I'm typically not a James Bond fan, but I actually really liked how they ""reinvented the formula"" with this one.",positive
"One of the best Bond movies since Sean Connery. Daniel Craig is a great James Bond and if you're a fan of the books, you'll love this one even more.",positive
"Positiivinen yllÃ¤ri, vaik ei ollukkaa perinteine Bondi, ni silti oli hyvin bondmainen Bondi. Daniel Craig oli sympaattinen, mutta silti nÃ¤ytti venÃ¤lÃ¤iseltÃ¤ painijalta.",negative
"First ""new"" Bond movie I've seen for years and I thought this guy was really good. Much better for being reset in modern day with more common gadgets etc",positive
it was fantastic and daniel craig is one of the best actors ever to take on the role of james bond,positive
"loved it. great way to establish a new bond and revamp the bond-verse. if you don't think craig can play bond, then go watch layer cake and that will change your opinion",positive
Refreshing new edition of James Bond. Great action and overall plot.,positive
Refreshing new edition of James Bond. Great action and overall plot.,positive
Brilliant film - back to the original Bond as he should have been. Craig is superb and actually bleeds when he's punched!! Dench as M is also played extremely well. Well worth watching if you're a Bond fan or not.,positive
well Sean Connery will always be Bond...but Daniel Craig makes him more real and believable...gadgets are not the main focus...except when saving his life...and the chase scene in madagascar was awesome... that guy could jump!,negative
"Loved it. Was reluctant to watch it, but enjoyed more than the other Bond movies. Can't wait to see the next one...",positive
"When I first saw this, I was a bit miffed to find that Bond had been replaced, but I think Daniel Craig pulls off a decent Bond. This was quite an interesting movie.",negative
"Best Bond flick to made in a long, long time!! Very sexy!",positive
"There may be one too many climaxes, rises and peaks, in this epic reboot to what was [to me] a dead franchise that had never been too appealing to begin with... but I couldn't tell you what to cut, 'cause everything that's there is executed with stunning energy, intelligence, and charm. Craig is miraculous, elevating the character well beyond anything I had ever imagined it could be. The script, though slightly overloaded and heavy, is nonetheless powerful, drenched in a duality between depth and fun, and utterly enthralling to the end. It's comparable to Casablanca, in that it is such a product of a system -- numerous writers, slightly propagandistic, balanced with every possible tonal element (well timed comedy, suspense, romance, action), finding a way to work as pure entertainment for the masses and a slightly more intellectual excercise for those willing/able to sense it... I am rambling. I fucking love this movie.",positive
"Casino Royale(2006)-8/10...the 21st James Bond film brought about a new era and a new Bond...as Daniel Craig becomes the 6th man to play 007. The film is directed by Martin Campbell with the title song ""You Know My Name"" sung by Chris Cornell of Audioslave fame and the former lead singer of Soundgarden. This is essentially an origin story as Bond has just been promoted to 00 status...his first mission is taking on a terrorist in Madagascar, and that doesn't go to well. Soon enough he encounters Le Chiffre, played by Mads Mikkelson (bleeding eye and all), who is banker to the world's terrorism. After a bungled attempt to cash in on the bombing of an airplane, he has set up a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro to pay off his $100 million debt. The lovely Eva Green plays Bond girl and treasury accountant Vesper Lynd, a woman who manages to strip away Bond's cold exterior...only to betray him later on. Great scenes include a breathless chase and fight at a construction site, a chase at the Miami airport, Bond surviving being poisoned during the poker game and the sinking of a house in Venice. At first I was not a huge fan of Daniel Craig as Bond or this Bond film, but after multiple viewings it really has grown on me a lot. Now with the introduction of the character again...I look for good old fashioned Bond! ""Reginald Bundy...critic for the Times.""",positive
"While Casino Royale isn't quite as stunning as some critics have made it out to be, it's definitely the Bond reboot we 007 fans were waiting for. There are pacing issues in the last half of the movie and occasional writing bumbles, but Casino Royale still satisfies and brings us a very promising new Bond in Daniel Craig. 3 and 1/2 stars.",negative
"I'm a Bond rube...that said, I enjoyed this. Great storyline (and KILLER chase scenes) but I felt that the romance really didn't work too well and the film was slightly predictable overall. I like Craig enough as Bond, though...",negative
"I have to say, out of all the bond movies i have seen, this is the best one ever made, and this decision was made after seeing it for the billionth time. Daniel Craig makes a great bond, the story is actually based on Ian Fleming's book about how bond became bond, and the action and drama are spot on. I couldn't (nor wouldn't) find anything wrong about this movie.",positive
"The gadgetry and toys were downplayed in this, leading to Quantum Of Solace's complete lack of gadgetry, which was a huge departure. Well done, though the lack of a definite ending was a really pain, and the emotional relationships were quite out of norm for the character.",positive
"The best Bond since Sean Connery, with Pierce Brosnan a close second, Daniel Craig brings a grittier and harder version of James Bond to the world. This film was fast-paced, well-written and masterfully directed by ""Goldeneye"" director Martin Campbell. Craig shares the screen with Eva Green, who plays Treasury agent Vesper Lynd, who shares a bittersweet romance with Bond. A fantastic film with great characters, thrilling action sequences and one hell of a lead, Casino Royale stands out in the Bond universe.",positive
"By far the best Bond movie I've seen to date. Daniel Craig has made the 007 character feasible enough to be believed in contrast to past renditions, while conveying the highest level of cool as well. Add a well crafted storyline and there you have it.",positive
"Lots of fun, and Daniel Craig oozes sex appeal.",positive
Good action... Miss the Bond Gadgets...,negative
"A breath of fresh air into an aging franchise. Bond is human again, plain and simple.",positive
"One hell of a movie from start to finish, with excitement, suspense, and clever tricks brimming at every seam. Sorry to use the old adage, but there really isn't a dull moment for me. Class, style, and entertainment all rolled into one is what one should expect from the name Bond, and this has all in droves. The perfect way to modernize a classic franchise.",positive
"Great Bond character. Not depend on gadget and it shows that Bond is really a bad ass. This is the character that i really like, more human. Great movie. Thumbs up!!",positive
"Best James Bond movie, ever. And after Sean Connery, Daniel Craig is the best James Bond ever.",positive
"I really liked this, but not as much as Goldfinger. I liked the action, but i felt it dragged along a little bit too long. The concept was kinda off with the whole card game that funds terrorism. That just didnt click with me.Daniel Craig is James Bond. I thought he pulled the part off perfectly. It was full of action but had really long off time between action scenes. Overall, an average Bond movie with an outstanding Bond.",positive
"I am not used to watching another person (the 6th Bond!) acting as James Bond (Pierce Brosnan). However, this younger Bond (Daniel Craig) did make the films more exciting by his energy and his daredevil personality. Overall, this movie was like the usual action-filled Bond movies with a lot more life-or-death cases. It was upsetting to see the people once thought of as friends turn into enemies. I miss seeing Q. I love his sense of humour. The special features on this film are much better than other films. The Bond Girls interviews went through previous films from the 1960s, so it was like a timeline of the various Bond movies. The other ones explained parkour, a new activity at the time. Two years later, the activity is quite popular. The car stunt was amazing to see how it was really done by professional stunt drivers.",negative
"A lot better than I expected, far better than the usual bond one man army cack, altough that smoochy love scene where hes recovering in the garden was a more painful watch than the chair scene, keep it up james, cheers Al",negative
"It was pretty good. I didn't like the story too much because James Bond was too lovey dovey in it. I know that is what the story was suppose to be about. But there wasn't as much action as you would want from a bond film. Daniel Craig was an except bond thought. He sure does know how to play the part. I really liked the opening, because it also showed the artistic part of bond films also.",negative
the reason why i took off half a star is because there wasent a car chase,positive
"No es de las mejorcitas de Bond, falto alguna persecuciÃ³n.",negative
it was prettttttttttty darn goood,negative
"Ah yeah, made me interested in bond again.",positive
"It only makes sense that a guy with that type of job should be one tough, mean, dangerous motherfucker. Craig is really the only Bond that's seemed like a genuine soldier/assassin type to me. The man is ugly as sin, but that works. Bond's still got charm, wits, and enough one-liners to keep even an old-school fan satisfied.",positive
"I'm going to say this now so I don't have to repeat it in later reviews of Bond films: Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery and Pierce Brosman. Casino Royale is anexcellent film, showing Bond before he became...well, the Bond we know and love. And while this movie may be diffrent from the other films (not being to cocky and such) it feels right for this type of movie, because Bond is human, and this is how Bond should be. With that being said, lets hope this Bond stays in the ring for a good long time.",positive
"Great perfection and a real boost up of the Franchise that had gone way over the top with the Brosnan era. Darker, more real and brilliantly directed. This is the Bond i wanted. Lots of surprises and some turning points you would never predict. Top movie.",positive
"One of the better Bonds, Daniel Craig, debuts in a very sharp installment, with a couple of big problems. You know James Bond, slick, smooth, rough and stylish. My first problem is that they kick the shit out of him, leaving him kicking and screaming. That in itself completely goes against his character. My other problem is that it goes overkill on the poker scenes. If I wanted to watch half an hour of poker, I'd switch my TV set over to ESPN 2. All that aside, I really liked it. Very well done action sequences and Daniel Craig is definitely up to the part and is, in my opinion, the best James Bond since Sir Sean Connery.",negative
My favorite Bond movie. Pretty much liked everything about it. Craig is the perfect guy to play James Bond. This was a good start for him.,positive
"Sean Connery has nothing to worry about. This was an ok Bond film. Not my favorite. As people give kudo's to any change in anything I have to say I go to Bond movies for that fantasy element. I think of him as a superhero. However, many will probably not agree with me and want to see someone more human. If that is the case then we have movies for that sort of thing. Even new franchises for that. So why can't we keep what we love about a character instead of changing him into another dark and brooding Timothy Dalton? Hopefully this will be short lived and we will get another Bond that has fun with the character. I nominate Clive Owen!",negative
"A much deeper aspect of Bond. He shows his immaturity as a double-00 agent, as he has just received his status. Also it does show a more human side of him and we slowly see him evolve into a cold-hearted killing machine.",positive
As good as it gets for a Bond film.,positive
What an amazing way to restart the Bond franchise - Daniel Craig is on his way to being the best Bond ever. This movie has a definite flair to it that is extremely fun and exciting - one of the best Bond movies ever.,positive
One of the best Bond films ever. Period.,positive
"I had my doubts about Daniel Craig as 'Bond', but he really delivers with this outing. Great story line as well as breath taking action sequences.",positive
"Great James Bond reboot! Finally a new look and way to look at the Bond series. Love the new plot and story. It was about time they did away with the sci-fi BS gadgets that undid the series long ago. Good action here and there, but slow in some spots in the middle. Still a great story. Daniel Craig is a great choice for James Bond. Love the fact they introduced Felix Leiter's character.",positive
"I have a hard time seeing Craig as Bond. He just doesn't have the look. Luckily for him, he had far better material here than Brosnan ever had to work with, and it makes for a good film, even if the card game went on about 15 minutes too long.",negative
the best 007 film........,negative
"This is a totally different James Bond which is a cross between Rambo and Jackie Chan and a little bit of Chow Run Fatt also. Watch twice in 2 language.. first is Russian and then in English which make alot more sense. Lots of action, the plot is alittle complex to understand but overall the most entertaining of all Bond movie...",positive
Daniel Craig blew me away. He quickly rocketed to the top of my list as the best Bond. One of my favourite Bond films.,positive
"A new style James, attractive. Very human... anticipating for the new one~",positive
"One of the best Bond films, I think!",positive
i'm not quite used to new James Bond. Guess it would be another new style of 007.,negative
"Entertaining, as the Bond movies are, and Daniel Craig has the Thing",negative
"The best Bond film since Goldfinger. Craig is magnificent as the MI6 rookie, who is sporatic yet efficient. This is a new Bond, a Bond that is believeable and likable, not some over-the-top expert at everything. If for some reason you have not seen this movie, stop reading my review and rent it now, you won't be dissapointed.",positive
An overall good movie that isnt great due to being way too long.,negative
i have no interest in any of the previous james bond movies until this one. and i enjoyed it. i like daniel craig as bond than pierce brosnan(never watch any of sean connery),positive
One of the best bond films yet!,positive
"was SO freakin long, but after thinking about it more and more, it was better than I thought it was going to be. awesome opening scene, and some decent action. def the Bond we have been waiting for. and vicious theme song.",negative
I was never in to the whole bond thing until this came out. Amazing movie.,positive
THIS WAS THE MOST UTTERLY BRILLIANT BOND FILM~~~~ THis was such a good comeback and this one was best!! The second one was a big dissapointment though..,positive
"Bond is not beyond hope as Die Another Day made me think. It lives again in this modern retelling making Bond fit perfectly with the post -9/11 world. Craig playes the best Bond yet and the most faithful to Fleming's vision. Casino Royale follows the book's plot almost perfectly though it lifts it out of the Cold War and places it in the modern day and makes the card game easier to understand. Fleming's Bond is cold, calculating, and somewhat heartless. Until now, Bond was Mr. Nice Guy. Not anymore. Craig brings a life and a darkness to Bond not seen since the novel The Man with the Golden Gun. Bring on the next in the series for Bond has truly returned.",positive
"Great movie to revitalize the tiring franchise. Daniel Craig does a good job to bring a more serious tone to the Bond series. Also, there are some pretty memorable scenes, from the chase scene through the construction site scene to the part where Bond was tortured (ouch). It definitely steps it up and brings back up to Jason Bourne level.",positive
"Easily my favorite James Bond movie. The visuals are stunning. Daniel Craig makes for a great bond. He is darker and more cynical than his predecessors while still retaining the wit and endless double entendres that Bond has become known for. This is also not the director's first bond film, Martin Campbell was the man behind the camera for the infamous Goldeneye. Perhaps his prior experience gave him all the necessities to make this picture a success. Makes me want to play some poker!",positive
"A tad long, but overall a nice reworking of what had a become a very tired franchise. Craig's Bond doesn't have the polish of his predecessors, but I think that's the point.",positive
"Not a bad movie at all. This is a little more... realistic than Bond films of the past but has very tense action in it as well as decent acting. Daniel Craig is a different kind of James Bond which I really like. It's actually quite incomparable to all of the 007 movies of the past. I'll see it again, and I actually look forward to Quantum of Solace now.",positive
"it didn't help me understand the second movie at all , because the plot made almost no sence with the one of the sequel (that saying, if i hadn't seen the 2nd before this one maybe i would've found it better...) but let's forget the sequel a bit... daniel craig does a great impersonation of bond, both being confident, a ladies men, and cocky just enought to make you lough while still not hating the guy. the love story between vesper and bond is a bit weird but nothing we haven't seen in any othe movie... the action is present while still not being over the top (looking at you quantum with the fight scene in the burning hotel...) and i would say overall it's a pretty fine movie, biggest problem with it beeing it's sequel",negative
So glad to see the Bond movies going back to their roots. Chase and fight scenes are definitely a massive upgrade from the previous ones.,positive
Revived my faith in 007.,positive
"Can't believe I never rated this one. Not only is it a great Bond movie, but it's a great action movie. Craig puts all other Bonds to shame as one of the best (and most human) action heroes this side of John McClain.",positive
"the absoulte perfect james bond movie! i myself am not exactly the biggest Bond lover, but this movie had a great mix of action and drama and Daniel Craig was brilliant as 007, he was the james bond that i have always wanted to see. the one that Ian Fleming would describe in his books, one that is so bad ass and fueled by his duty of work that he just does not give a shit and does whatever he can to complete his mission. Although, i am not a huge fan of the franchise, i have seen enough James Bond movies to know that this one truly is the most well made and the best. I don't think they ever will make a Bond film better. It makes up for everything where the Brosnan films went wrong (except for Goldeneye, that was decent)... Either way a great film, even though it is pretty bloody long, it is still an epic film.",positive
"Great Bond movie. It's full of action and intrigue, and Daniel Craig definitely exceeded my expectations of him as the new 007. Only four stars because I couldn't stand the Bond girl.",positive
"am i the only one who was kinda like meh about it? i thought it was very overrated and had WAY too much poker and boring parts in it. i mean poker is fun to play, not to watch half a movie of.....",negative
I think I liked this film. It lost its way a little after he won the game. Good end scene though. Was good enough to make me want to see the new one.,negative
"New life injected into an old franchise. They could have gone right past Roger Moore & Timothy Dalton, to Pierce Brosnan, then Daniel Craig. Martin Campbell should be the default Bond director for as long as he likes (see GoldenEye). Bond #21 is probably the most like what Ian Flemming expected from his protagonist. Still, I think its too bad they dumbed it down at the casino with Texas Hold 'Em instead of baccarat.",positive
"When you left the theatre after the last Bond movie, were you satisfied? After this one, I sure as hell was. I don't know what it was, really, but somehow, somewhere, this movie brought back all the things I liked about the series. Oh btw. The title song is great. Top5 stuff in my little book of Bond songs.",positive
Best Bond film to date.,positive
Probably the best Bond film..brought a new breath into a dying series..and created a darker..meaner..more likeable bond.,positive
It's about time the first Bond book was made correctlly,positive
very goood film i loved the twist lots of action and a very gourgess bond girl on of the best ones yet !!,negative
Pour moi l'un des meilleur James Bond,positive
refreshing compared to Quantum of Solace...,positive
My favorite bond movie. Daniel Craig was awesome,positive
I didn't rate this one earlier until after I saw Quantum of Solace. This was an amazing bond movie. Much more gritty and dark than all others before it. Daniel Craig makes a good Bond!,positive
"Awesome reboot. Given how silly the Bond movies were starting to get (an invisible car? seriously?), this was the only logical answer before they lost all credibility. Daniel Craig turns in an awesome performance that hearkens back to the days of Connery (even in how he looks), and Judi Dench continues to make the role of M her own. Bond: I always thought M was a randomly assigned initial, I had no idea it stood for-- M: Utter one more syllable and I'll have you killed. My money's on Maude.",positive
"Perfect James Bond Movie, it rly is the best bond of them all even surpassing Goldfinger, he brought the brawn and absolute grit that should be bond, as well as being the greatest pussy magnet on planet Earth.",positive
Daniel Craig's debut as James Bond doesn't fail...excellent plot and excellent introduction to characters that will be seen and heard about in the next couple of flims...Le Chiffre was a badass villain,positive
"This movie shows a gleam of Bond before he gets 007-status from the government and the Licence to kill. Recently promoted, he is sent to Montenegro to challenge the ruthless bankman Le Chiffre, played by Mads Mikkelsen. ""M"" lets gorgeous Vesper Lynd from Finance department keep an eye on him, and to provide him with 10 million dollars... This is without question the best Bond film I have ever seen. Daniel Craig is making him human; he bleeds, feels and has those schizophrenian psychopath characteristics a man of his caliber must have after what he's been through, and therefore also true to Ian Flemings original Bond from the books. You can find yourself asking ""was that necessary"", ""did he do the right thing"", ""he is mad"". I love it.",positive
"Bond as he should be. The franchise was getting gaudy and campy - it was great to see it reborn. Bond flicks should be gritty, hard hitting and powerful; sleek and sexy, not flashy and fanciful. His one liners should be conserved and not flung around willy-nilly. This film's greatness is fueled two things: Bond as he should be, and a fantastic actor backed by a plot worthy of Sir Ian Fleming's work.",positive
I have so much to learn from James Bond...,positive
"i've never been a super-crazy Bond fan, but this film was highly enjoyable - great stunts & action sequences, and although somewhat expected, the plot twists were interesting - kept me hooked till the last second! :P",positive
"Nicely executed style with fantastic action sequences and engaging twists. However, not the most emotionally gripping. I think my favorite part was the B&W, noir-ish opening scene.",positive
"Loved it. Had a more serious twist than the other films, which adds a refreshing new spin to the Bond franchise. Daniel Craig definitely needs some warming up to as the new protege of Bond, but quickly captures the essence. What I enjoy most about Daniel Craig is his somewhat unethical, sadistic and dark involvement with his role, he portrays the vigilante/wild side of Bond in his early years, quite enjoyable.",positive
Daniel Craig is so hot!,positive
"A more classy, elegant bond than the likes of the past, Daniel Craig portrays a character on the likes of Jason Bourne, not of Sean Connery. This is not only a step up in recent Bond films, but the best Bond film of them all. Instead of relying on silly gadgets and trying to bait as many women as possible, Bond's most underused weapon is used, the brain. Now, perhaps, the film gets a tad heavyhanded in the romantics department, anyone could have guessed the ending, but just like 'The Dark Knight', it's a rather new element in seemingly-mindless action films, the reluctant hero. It's not the CGI, but the gorgeous set locations and choreographed fight sequences, not the tacky one liners, but the British wit that makes this film ooze with appeal. I expect to be disappointed with 'Quantum of Solace', it'll be hard to top this.",positive
"I actually like Daniel Craig as James Bond, even though he doesn't fit the physical description of him. He's no Connery, but he's damn good.",positive
"In attempting to reboot the longest-running film franchise, the Broccolis and Eon Production knew they had to tread carefully, making sure they didn't upset the fanbase while, at the same time, find a way to reinvigorate the familiar Bond elements. That's why I think this installment is the best in quite some time - because every bit of this movie has been carefully developed and scrutized for maximum effect. For starters, Daniel Craig's interpretation of 007 is perfect for this origin story: his Bond is unrefined, ignorant of standard MI-6 procedure, and reluctant to embrace the requesite tuxedos and gadgets. In short, it's a good starting point, yet gives us enough inklings of the Bond that he'll ultimately become. In addition, it's probably the most female-friendly 007 flick in the series, with the closest thing we'll every get to a full-fledged 007 romance (Tracy Bond notwithstanding); curiously, there are more skimpy shots of Bond in this movie than the Bond girls. The action set-pieces are exciting on a large scale, with the free-running chase as the movie's high point (although that wicked Aston Martin car flip is exemplary, too). My only pet peeves: the gratuitous Sony product placement (how about that Blu-ray security system, eh?) and the awkward vibe of the last half-hour, which present so much lovey-dovey happiness that you can't help but feel, ""Well, this isn't going to end well."" But when the final scene comes up, with the absolutely chilling entrance of the Bond theme and Bond's trademark line, it's pretty hard to deny the high quality of this film. Heck, it almost makes you want to forget that 1967 monstrosity of the same name. :)",positive
"Director, Martin Campbell delivers another terrific reboot of the Bond franchise (He also, directed ""Goldeneye""). The action sequences especially the already classic on-foot chase scene in the beginning are brilliantly constructed. Daniel Craig's committed performance is already shaping him up to be the best Bond yet. It's also, a surprisingly rich piece of entertainment. This does for Bond what ""Batman Begins"" did for...well, Batman. Easily, the best Bond flick since ""From Russia With Love"".",positive
"Just a brilliant movie. As Bond movies go, this one was thoroughly enjoyable. Craig makes a much more convincing James Bond, and the intricacies to the plot actually enhance it this time. The whole card game cliche was a bit stupid, but even that worked well, to a degree.",positive
"Casino Royale is a movie that was and still is amazing. Nobody can replace Sean Connery as 007, but Daniel Craig is the 2nd best. This movie had all of the action, suspense and thrills that all Bond movies should have.",positive
James Bond done right. See Quantum of Solace!!!,positive
"this movie's just not very interesting. daniel craig is awesome and a few of the sequences are awesome (the torture scene is where this series should be at, but the producers would never have the balls...pun intended)....the opening is incredible and sets a mood the film fails to live up to. i mean, jesus, how brutal is it to start the movie off with bond killing two men in cold blood? why is that scene immediately followed by a scene where bond fucking parkour chases some dude through a construction site? it's like they thought the opening would have been too heavy for us peons and decided to give us something to clap our chimp hands at.",negative
"Er jo Bond fan og kan ikke si at dette her skuffer pÃ¥ noe vis... MÃ¥tte ta en oppfrisker i kveld, skal se Quantum of Sollace i morgen..",positive
"When this first came out, I had boycotted it, because I didn't agree with the casting of Daniel Craig, because his hair is rather blonde, and James Bond is not supposed to be blonde. So then, I decided to watch it because my brother was going on about it, and it was really good! But it was sooooo sad..........and it would have gotten five stars but it was a bit confusing.",positive
"Watched on 11/13/08. Surprisingly and fittingly the only movie I've watched in about two months. It's my third viewing of this revival of a franchise, and I've grown to like it even more. Based on the orignal James Bond novel crafted by the cheeky Ian Flemming, Writers had thier work cut out for them to turn a book about a card game into a feature length film. Never has a game of Hold-em been so exhilerating. Though I am incredibly biast to all things Bond. this movie orignally left me with mixed feelings about the approach. Maybe it was the stretched plotline, or maybe the uninspired romantic sequences, possibly the lack of a good car chase. Either way when I saw it on opening night it failed to meet my ultra high Bond Expectations. Still it managed to successfully bring a series back from the brink of death (The World is not Enough, Die Another Day) Craig is superb and rough, what he lacks in charisma he makes up for in ""badass-ness"". Eva Green is beyond stunning. Judi Dench is perfect. The Theme songs ""You Know My name"" by Chris Cornell is spot on with the series, keeping it daring yet classy. What trully makes this a Bond film, is the unmistaken sense of ""cool"" the movie leaves you with. It will be interesting to see how they mold this new ""no nonsense"" take on Bond into future iterations.",negative
"SÃ¥nn passe, Men sexy Bondda",negative
"A much more serious twist in the Bond franchise. Craig's portrait of the character shows us a Bond that could seriously hurt you if you get on his bad side, which i love. Eva Green is also gorgeous in the flick. Story wise, it is very intriguing as the audience is served with a twist at the end. A good ""first view of Bond"" movie.",positive
"Very different take on bond this time,more edgy and a better view on what makes him tick. Nonetheless a great film and look forward to quantem of solace",positive
"After two views, it enters my top 5 Bond films (behind Goldfinger, Goldeneye, From Russia With Love, and Liscence to Kill). I was hesistant when they named Craig the new Bond, but he shows the genesis of Bond in a harsh way. Fantastic action scenes, and two really realistic and gritty kills, even for a Bond film. Eva Green and the Italian chick are two worthy additions to the Bond girl catalog. And just to show I'm not sexist, my favorite part of the film might be Judi Dench's slightly more important than usual turn as M. There are some tough parts, though. The torture scene and the destruction of the Aston Martin both made me weep.",positive
my favorite Bond film.. Vesper Lynd is so resonating..,positive
"Martin Campbell + Daniel Craig = awesome Bond film. Sexy, fast paced, intense, witty... and more sexy. This film is one of the best Bond films to date. Daniel Craig holds nothing back in portraying Bond in a more humanistic way. The story is intriguing and does well to set up Bond in a new light, a more dark, deep, and meaningful light. The action sequences are amazingly choreographed, and... actually, there is nothing about this film i can find that is ""bad"". Well, ok, that black kid on the beach smiling after that hotty on the horse, was retarded... but besides that i was entertained throughout and wanting more Bond... now!",positive
"Damn this is good, perhaps my favorite of the series. This was a back to basics reboot of the Bond character and certainly one of the best 007 films. The action, dialogue, and even the tender moments are well done. See it.",positive
I watched this 2 hour and 24 minute subliminal Sony advertisement on my Sony Bravia TV through my Sony Blu-ray player. I was so engrossed that I actually turned off the ringer on my Sony Ericsson 580i Walkman phone so as not to be disturbed!,negative
"Having read several of Flemings books, I can say this one is very lose to the intial concept of Bond as he saw it and an excellant film.",positive
"The BEST Bond film so far...but, I also liked ""Goldfinger"" and ""Goldeneye"". Martin Campbell gives a kinda different take on Bond. In here, Bond doesn't have those unbelievable gadgets. This one's a lot more realistic, and has more depth than the past Bond films. And, whew, Daniel Craig gives James Bond a new attitude! I can't picture Brosnan, Moore or Connery doing ""the torture scene"". He's really good as Bond.",positive
this is one of the best james bond movies ever (besides goldfinger and goldeneye) and daniel craig is an efficient killer. no gadgets or shaken or stirred BS. this movie was hands down emotional and action packed!,positive
Recently rewatched this movie and it's still great. Probably my favorite Bond movie of all.,positive
"they fucked up the story pretty good, the book was much better",positive
"Takes the polished formulas and roughens them up a little bit, Bond via Bourne not only works but may have been necessary.",positive
"Successful reboot of the James Bond series, so much in fact id say this is my favorite 007 film. Daniel Craig is excellent.",positive
at last! a bond who looks like he isn't just a girl's blouse with a fancy accent.,negative
"I like this movie, a lot, but I don?t salivate over it the way a lot of people do. I have a fair share of problems with it, some are rooted in my fanatical Bond enthusiasm, some are outright legitimate criticisms. First of all, the decision not to open this with the gun barrel was an evil bullshit idea. That opening is a tradition and not having it is like having ham instead of turkey on Thanksgiving, maybe a perfectly good replacement in theory but completely against the customs of the day and just plain wrong. That?s indicative with the bigger problem I have with the movie: why did it have to be a reboot? I?m all for making Bond a grittier character, but did they need to make him a green agent just starting out as a 00 agent? I don?t think so, I think there were plenty of ways they could have made a grittier character without taking the drastic measure of denying everything that came before. Also, having Bond playing Texas Hold ?Em instead of Baccarat is heresy. What?s more the game they play is completely unbelievable, every time I play poker I?m lucky to so much as get a three of a kind, but these guys regularly seem to get dealt full houses and straight flushes. The odds of them getting a hands like these as much as they do are astronomically low and this breaks some of the tension for me. Of course most of this probably isn?t an issue for audiences that are less picky. Aside from these problems, this really is pretty damn good. They followed the Ian Flemming novel surprisingly closely aside from the three (very good) action scenes they added. As a movie buff this provided me with a lot to like, as a James Bond freak it kind of pissed me off in a couple ways, in the end I?m a movie buff first.",positive
"Great Bond film. Daniel Craig is a tough-as-nails, hardened Bond and is put through the wringer as he tries to foil Le Chiffre. Great movie.",positive
"sympa, mais ou sont les poils et les prises de savate de Sean Connery ?!",negative
"U trenutku kada je najpoznatijem svetskom filmskom serijalu bilo potrebno temeljno osvezavanje i ozivljavanje, to je i dobijeno. Za to same reci pohvale. Bond je sada sirova pandurchina, dobija batine poput porucnika MekLejna, tuce se poput Stivena Sigala, a krece se poput likova ''Pritajenog tigra, skrivenog zmaja''. Sa druge strane, on je i osecajan, zaljubljuje se, i dopusta da mu emocije pomute britansku hladnokrvnost po kojoj je postao cuven. E sad, na kraju se postavlja pitanje: Da li je to Dzejms Bond? Po meni ne, ali ocigledno da drugi misle tako... Ovo je samo jos jedan sjajan akcioni film, predugacak (bespotreno produzavanje scena jurnjave i pokeraskog duela), ali nema tog shlifa i shtofa za nesto sto je institucija zvana Dzejms Bond, pocev od glavnog glumca (klempavi boxer), preko njegove fatalne ljubavi (neupecatljiva glavna zenska uloga), pa do preskocenih ''standardnih mesta'' u ovom serijalu.",negative
Just brilliant. Did for Bond what Bourne did for action/spy movies. Love it.,positive
"For the 21st film in the James Bond franchise, a change needed to happen. The Brosnan Bond films devolved into a mess of effects and emotionless drivel. Somehow, Casino Royale not only rebooted the franchise, it was a perfect example of how a James Bond film can work in the 21st century. The story is tight, and all of the actors have their A-game on. Daniel Craig, seen as a wild card choice for James Bond, took the role and made it his own, becoming the second-best Bond after Sean Connery. Eva Green presented a Bond girl who not only was gorgeous but could also hold her own against Bond, making Vesper Lynd a benchmark in Bond girls. The action sequences were well-formed and a thrill to watch. When the first major action sequence of the film, a parkour chase all over a construction sight, is one of the best chase sequences ever captured on film, it shows what kind of standard this film set as an action film. What's even better is that the action is delicately balanced by excellent character drama and suspense, with the entire poker game being a perfect example of both. Even after seeing the film and knowing what will happen next, the suspense still remains. Casino Royale is not just a great Bond movie - it is a thoroughly rewatchable action-drama for both men and women, and it stands as a 21st-century action film standard.",positive
Craig is the next Connery,positive
"Makes Pierce Brosnan look like a pussy, how could I grow up thinking that?",positive
"Okay, this movie was beyond over-hyped. I admit, I fell for that hype and felt this was one of the better Bond films. Now that the much anticipated sequel is on its way, I decided to give ""Casino Royale"" a second viewing. Let me say, Craig is a good Bond, but he's not one of the better ones. He's certainly better than Dalton and Moore, but he's missing class. He's missing charm. Maybe that's the point. Maybe he's supposed to be a hardened blue-collar Bond. I honestly don't know. But I can't ignore that the character I love from the previous 3 decades of Bond films is missing. Still, it's refreshing to see a new take, even if it doesn't ""feel"" like a Bond film. Now onto the movie. First of all, it's far too long. It's length is filled with overly long action sequences, a completely boring, unromantic, and irrational poker game, and a plotline that only exists to service the next film. That's right, ""Casino Royale"" is a two and a half hour precursor to ""Quantum of Solace."" I'm guess they're going to be considered one film, but that's just dumb. Part of the fun of James Bond is that each film is its own adventure. This one felt very long and incomplete. It's dejecting to invest so much time only to be left wondering ""what was the point?"" Maybe the point was to introduce a new Bond character. If that's the case, then the movie succeeds very well. I certainly don't hate ""Casino Royale."" In fact, I do enjoy it. But I think it could have been a little better. It's not the best addition to the series, but believe me when I say, it's definitely not the worst.",negative
probably the second or 3rd best in the series,positive
I do not like Bond movies but this one was actually very good. I enjoyed the second half more than the first. I like trying to figure out who is the bad person and such. This movie also has the best torture scene ever. Overall a good movie. Plus watching Daniel Craig and Eva Green the entire time is quite enjoyable.,negative
sweet & sexy eva green!,positive
"Not really a bond fan, but this one was damn good. Daniel Craig and Eva Green are excellent and make a stunning, intelligent couple. The story made some neat twists and turns. Looking forward to Quantum now...",positive
i preffered quantum of solace,negative
"Brilliant - completely revitalizes the Bond franchise. Daniel Craig is the perfect choice for Bond, a cold, hard and seemingly emotionless lethal weapon. Some brilliant action scenes and jaw dropping stunts. Was quite traumatized by the destruction of the Aston tho I must say. A brilliant film with a brilliant new Bond and the new version of the emerge from the sea scene was inspired, and pretty nice to look at. Craig combines the look, talent, believability and coolness of the perfect Bond. May he make many more!",positive
"THe only good Bond film, seriously they all suck",positive
"Kyl mÃ¤ diggasin, tÃ¤s oli hyvÃ¤ saundi",positive
Best Bond movie ever.Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond.,positive
"At a point in time when cinema's favorite secret agent needed a serious revamp, this film delivered in spades (pun intended). I have seen most of the Bond films and sadly they tend to be incredibly hit-or-miss. Thankfully this was an absolute hit, in fact its one of the best in my opinion. While there was a great deal of speculation as to whether Daniel Craig could successfully pull of the Bond image, all doubts are imediately dissolved the minute the intro sequence kicks in; Craig is actually better then many of the oher more recent Bonds. Eva Green's performance as Vesper must also be mentioned here: while she doesn't have the mind-blowing sexiness of most Bond Girls, she has character (and can act for that matter) and a classic sense of beauty that many of Bond's women lack. Oh yeah, and Le Chiffre is a GREAT Bond Villain, and the story and action found here are all top notch. I do have a few minor complaints, most notably the absence of any really notable secret agent gadgets. Also, the scene in which Bond gets poisoned and ends up defibrillating himself was fine, but I think recovering from the whole experience and running right back into the action afterwords was pushing it a bit. Regardless, this is a spectacular and welcome addition to the Bond catalogue.",positive
Easily the best James Bond movie.,positive
Great movie. I just rewatched it in preparation for the sequel. This Bond is really a cross between Sean Connery and Matt Damon in the Bourne series. Awesome!,positive
An excellent action flick and a stellar Bond film. I love the return to the character that Ian Flemming originally created.,positive
Daniel Craig is yummy!,positive
Most of the Bond movies are trash. This one is great.,positive
"[font=Comic Sans MS][i]I love Graig as bond he gives the character the edgyness it has been missing since Sir Connery!! i dispised Pierce as bond with his stupid poses, The Quantum Of Solace looks very promissing[/i][/font]",positive
"FUCKING AWESOME FUCKING AWESOME FUCKING AWESOME!!! THERE IS NO ADJECTIVE THAT SUMS UP THIS FILM!!! I was literally blown away, seeing it almost two years after it was out in theaters... i'm literally a jackass for not seeing this film in theaters.:} But i will say this: I will be a fool to miss Quantun of Solace...",positive
Damn good movie. I was very suprised. The acting was top notch and the action was great. Can't wait for the next movie!,positive
This was the first bond movie I've seen and it was amazing. Great blend of action and story and Daniel Craig was awesom. And it made me fall in love with the amazing Judi Dench. She's fantastic.,positive
"Admittedly, I was never a big Bond fan. I've seen a few here and there and always found them rather pointless and somewhat repetitive. Casino Royale however, is different. I gathered as much when it was billed as the ""first"" James Bond film but I admit that I really did enjoy this film. There's a human element in it - both from Vesper and Bond that makes this so much better than any other Bond film to date - the shower scene for instance, that in itself made the entire film worth watching and then how everything plays out that systematically strips Bond of his capacity to feel. It was just... far better than I thought it was going to be. I don't know how popular this was with Bond fans but I can definitely say that for those who are *not* fans of the Bond franchise, this would definitely be the pick of the lot... so far. We'll see what Quantum of Solace has to offer.",negative
"Arguably the best James Bond film, ""Casino Royale"" is a special accomplishment, for Martin Campbell and his associates have managed to bring something new to the 007 series. Though Sean Connery's James Bond is more iconic, Daniel Craig brings greater depth to the character, revealing a trained killer who is aware that he is losing his soul. I have heard complaints that the film goes on for too long, but I like the twist, which adds on another act right where so many Bond films have left off. The cold and stylish pre-credits sequence, shot in black and white from crooked angles, is particularly superb.",positive
"Casino Royale is something different for Bond. In pressing ""The Big Restart Button in the Sky"", the slate is metaphorically wiped clean, and what we get is rather special. Granted, it still has some problems (such as a rather confusing plot), but this film delivers with a great sense of style, a suitably evil villain, and a slower but finer pace which suits the genre. Daniel Craig is good as a slightly more brutal Bond, as is all of the cast, and the high tensioned scenes of Poker allow for some nifty camerawork. Easily the best Bond since GoldenEye.",positive
Best bond every by far! Connery should be worried about his legacy as the best Bond! This is a great movie!,positive
"With elaborate action sequences, a memorable on foot chase scene, and the first building sinking I've ever seen in a movie this Bond film is one of the best. Daniel Craig brings something new to the character... kind of a darker side... an ""I DON'T GIVE A DAMN"" kind of mentality. The only thing to be said about this movie is... I miss Q....and R.",positive
"The last Bond, Quantum Of Solace could be good movie if there is no stupid end like it was. I mean why did he do all the Bond stuff? Because of happiness some Bolivian leader and lower price of water? It is to poor for James Bond, isn't it? The movie was: :rotten: but better than boring game is Casino Royale.",negative
"I grew up with James Bond films, and this is BY far the best Bond film I've seen.",positive
"James Bond finally goes back to his roots: a troubled, sociopathic spy. This is without a doubt the best bond film since Goldfinger. This is actually one of my all time favorite movies. period.",positive
"Needed a refresher before the new one so I watched my shiny new blu-ray today. Easily one of my favorite Bond movies, and possibly the best one in the entire series. I don't think you can judge a Bond performance though based on one appearance, so we'll see how Craig does this weekend.",positive
"Loved the intro of this movie :) Action was fairly good, this movie plot was good and Daniel Craig did a great job of the acting! I can't wait to see the new movie for this!",positive
Best reboot ever! I think,positive
u wanna fight ya prick,positive
This one was really fantastic !,positive
Three Word Reviews: Stoked for Solace!,positive
"good movie, next up: quantum of solace",positive
"Gritty, sexy, cool. I knew when Daniel Craig was cast as the new 007 that we were in for a treat. Anyone who hasn't seen Layer Cake won't understand what I'm saying, but if you have, you know what I'm talking about. In my opinion, far and away the best Bond and best Bond film. My only knock on Casino Royale is that it ended twice. Though, this flaw wasn't unforgivable, and it may be justified if Quantum of Solace lives up to the new Bond's introduction. I recommend seeing this Bond first if you haven't seen any of the other ones; you never get a second chance to make a first impression.",positive
"Not the usual Bond formula. Call me a hater, but this one isn't the cat's meow.",negative
"Beste 007 siden Goldeneye i alle fall. Daniel Craig overrasket meg positivt, og det er til og med antydning til manus denne gangen...",negative
The only near perfect Bond movie.,positive
"yummy, drool, slurrrp :P~",negative
"A superb reinvention of the Bond franchise. I found Pierce Brosnan's Bond limp, Roger Moore's efforts farcical, and Connery just totally outdated. In terms of action, gadgets and girls the revamped Casino Royale delivers a gripping (and importantly not too far-fetched) spy-film to rival the ante-upping Bourne trilogy. Classic Bond fans will hate it. Film fans will love it.",positive
Daniel Craig suddenly became good looking to me after I watched this movie. Very few stunt scenes not done by him.,positive
"Love this movie, its better than the Quantum of Solace. Lots of actions and the duration is almost 3 hours as well. Really worth to watch and I like Daniel Craig in here, he looks cool and not old like the one in Quantum of Solace!!",positive
"Een fantastische reboot van een franchise die dringend aan een reality-check toe was. Stunts worden naar een nieuw niveau getild maar blijven geloofwaardig. De Freerunning achtervolging is Ã©Ã©n van de spectaculairste achtervolgingen ooit. (TE VOET dan nog!) De manier waarop de actie in beeld wordt gebracht is schitterend. Daniel Craig heeft zich volledig gegeven voor deze rol. Hij zorgt ervoor dat de nieuwe Bond ijzersterk is in actiescÃ¨nes en weet hem tegelijk ook wat karakter mee te geven. Eva Green is meer dan een Bond-girl. Ze staat op gelijke voet met hem. Voor mij is dit de beste Bond-film die ik gezien heb. Spijtig genoeg kon het vervolg, Quantum of Solace, hier niet aan tippen.",positive
"Excellent Bond Film, by far one of the best. Daniel Craig proves everyone wrong who said he'd be a bad bond because he had blond hair. Way to go Daniel Craig!",positive
"Definitely some nice eye candy, but not particularly memorable. In fact, I hadn't remembered I watched it until part way through re-watching it.",negative
"OH MY GOSH THE OPENING CREDITS WERE FREAKIN GREAT!! This movie was just straight up awesome. Awesome action, intriguing card games, hot ladies, and James Bond. James Bond aka 007 played by Daniel ""the douche"" Craig. I hate daniel craig. I dont like his movies and his acting. But since he was asked to play James Bond he had noo choice but to do a dang good job. Bcuz thats James Bond we are talkin about. This is honestly my first time watching a James Bond movie. You can tell im from generation X. lol anyways overall this is a great movie bcuz u get nuttin but the best from a james bond movie, and i cant wait till Quantum of Solace.",positive
After die another day Bond needed reinventing and Casino Royale does just this giving us a more brutal rough round the edges feel which works very nicely...killing people no longer is a result of a quick chop to the neck but is messy business...very impressed.,positive
"Difficil a m`habituer a L'acteur, mais tres bon film",positive
"After watching this 007 adventure for the second time tonight (first time was in the theaters), I now have a better appreciation of the movie as a whole. Daniel Craig is an excellent choice as Bond, the action was intense, the movie score was great, and I am now looking forward to the story being continued with ""Quantum Of Solace"" in just a few days.",positive
i love it!!! well not entirely i cant get some sutf but i love adventure,positive
"Je ne suis pas du tout un fan de James Bond mais je dois que j'ai vraiment apprÃ©ciÃ© ce film. OK beaucoup de clichÃ©s Ã  la 007, mais bon, c'est inÃ©vitable. Tout de mÃªme de trÃ¨s bon dialogues intelligents et Daniel Craig parfait dans son rÃ´le de brute.",positive

"Worst Bond ever,now the writer ain't writing (obviously) STOP making shit attempts at Bond Movies",negative
"the best James Bond movie I've ever seen, Daniel Craig was excellent!!! finally a badass action film where the main character doesn't give a damn!!!",positive
"I am a life long Bond and this is, to me, the 2nd best entry in the series. I love the serious, gritty feel of the film. Craig, of whom I was highly skeptical, is THE greatest Bond, since Connery, Eva Green is one of the most beautiful Bond women, ever. A masterpiece that gets better with each viewing.",positive
not bad..a better james i guess.,negative
"Restart piuttosto discusso della serie di James Bond. Sicuramente Craig non convince completamente, visti i mitici predecessori, ma la serie entra in un nuovo stadio di realismo con una storia davvero interessante. Davvero straordinarie le scene d'azione!",positive
"I was a little skeptical to see it. Daniel Craig didn't look like he would make a good James Bond. I was wrong. I'm the last person I know to see it. It was so hyped to me that I thought ""there's no way this is as good as everyone said it is."" I was wrong. This is Bond's first adventure. At least his first as a Double O agent. He started the movie in an Old Navy shirt and a pretty cool Ford. You literally see the way he had to earn the Aston Martin and the 3 piece suits. His famous ""Shaken not stir"" was all screwed up. None of the catch phrase was right.That's they way it's supposed to be because this is his first mission. Nothing was right until the end of the movie and you have the sense of 'yep you earned it'. The pacing of the previous James Bond is so slow compared to this one. This is a movie about Bond not his villain. The death of the villain happened pretty early. The rest of the movie was dedicated to the lesson Bond needs to learn by the end of the movie.",positive
"Daniel Craig is fantastic as James Bond in this film based upon Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel. James must outsmart a terrorist from winning a large sum of money in his first mission. The film only feels long in retrospect, which isn't a bad thing. The main problem with this film is the ending leads and misleads a bit too long. However, all is necessary to establish the character Bond will become in sebsequent stories.",positive
"Directed By: Martin Campbell Starring: Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Judi Dench My Review: Long time no see Bond. This movie explain how James Bond received his 007 tittle (the opening scene). Daniel Craig stars as Ian Fleming's James Bond now. This is the most realistic Bond, well the first realistic Bond I ever saw. Eva Green as the leading Bond Girl, is very good. This is what we called Bond Girl. The reason why this movie needs appraisal: 1.It's a re-boot, and it has a different style compared to the other Bond. 2.Daniel Craig is the perfect choice for this kind of Bond 3.Eva Green did well to play as a double agent who love James Bond. 4.Even though there's no Q or Miss Moneypenny, this movie showed that it didn't need them. 5.The gun-shooting-barrel-sequence is modified. 7.It has a nice twist and a problem that still need to be solved. 8.It's very realistic. 9.Well, no ""Shaken not Stirred"" mentioned by Bond, he has new style of drink. 10.Finally,the music was amazing (You Know My Name). It's a proper song for this kind of Bond. That's it. Casino Royale is amazing. It's worth to watch more than once. Memorable Moment: James avoid Vesper, in high speed using his Aston Martin DBS V12, causing the car crushed. Memorable Quotes: Vesper Lynd: Am I going to have a problem with you, Mr. Bond? James Bond: No, don't worry, you're not my type. Vesper Lynd: Smart?

"I think he is not so smart than the previous bond ,that Pierce Brosnan did",negative
"finally somebody replacing mr. ""most boring bond ever"" brosnan! i like craig for his physical way of acting, loooooving the movie!",positive
"A new start for James Bond and what a start! Daniel Craig sure is a good Bond, regardless what has been said. And the movie itself is still very Bond-like, even if some traditional things are not there. Still, every merchandise needs to review itself from time to time (like Batman merchandise did successfully) and I can honestly say I really liked Casino Royale and Daniel Craig's performance as a James Bond, who is a bit more rougher on the edges, powerful, dangerous and still very charismatic. The story has been really solidly updated to modern times and all the needed ingredients come bundled. So, just buckle up and enjoy the ride!",positive
Apart from findin it a bit 2 long it was gd. Plenty of action throughout.,negative
"Bond de bonne facture, avec un Daniel Craig qui souligne enfin la dimension profondement inquietante de cette machine a tuer. Mais l'accentuation du realisme ""serieux"" dans les Bond recents jure avec la betise monumentale de sa perception du reel. Dans le temps le cote ludique et jouissif des Bond, qui ne se prenaient pas trop au serieux, rendait le projet plus coherent.",negative
"I loved the whole thing, the only question I have is if the CIA were to apprehend Le Chiffre, how come he wound up free and torturing Bond near the end?",negative
Brilliant movie and the best bit is that there is no typical 007 stupidity like vanishing cars and really ridiculus gadgets.....,negative
Which I saw as part of homework for Quantum. I see now why the world went gaga over craggy Daniel Craig. v v sexy. good show.,negative
"Casino Royale is the film that everyone was hoping for: slick, entertaining, intense, and downright awesome. Daniel Craig takes Bond to a new level, shedding Brosnan's swaggered ""I'm all that and a bag of chips"" mentality and bringing the audience the Bond of the future. Sly, naive, and stunning, Craig blasts away all competition. Bravo, Daniel, bravo!",positive

"Awesome movie! Had to say it though in retrospect ;) My favourite Bond movie to date. Daniel Craig is the best, most believable Bond ever!

I think this is the worst James Bond movie yet... I am not impressed at all by Daniel Craig either... Even the action sequences were badly filmed...,negative
"[color=#787878][font=Arial][color=black]I think the way you have to view this film is that it's being more faithfully towards the original book personality of Bond. Having read a few of the books I can see, that Craig's bond is closer to the books. The books describe a much darker and hurt bond than the earlier films up to '[i]Die Another Day'[/i] (2002). Even though Bond at the start is the suave guy we all know, but when he falls in love with Vesper we see something that is new and explains how Bond in [i]'On Her Majesty Secret Service' was [/i]so heartless and quick to move on after Tracey's Death.[/color][/font][/color] [color=#787878][font=Arial][color=black] [/color][/font][/color] [color=black][color=#787878][font=Arial][color=black]A lot of people have complained that the film is too boring in the middle because of the poker game; I dont feel that this made me feel bored.

"Craig is not Fleming's Bond, but this movie has the brutality that Fleming's novels often had. A much more successful variation on the formula than it had any right to be.",positive
dommage que Craig n'ai pas d'expression du visage,positive
"Compared to the disaster that was 'Die another Day' this is a masterpiece. Craig's Bond is more believable and more complex than Brosnan who got lazy with his acting. The direction is excellent and brings real tension to a plot which is generally weak (the world's fate in the hands of poker players!). The big dissappointment with this film is the dreadful dialogue which Craig and Dench do well to say with a straight face. Eva Green is not so capable and the film veers between Bourne at its best and a Ferrero 'Ambassador, you are spoiling us') Rochet commercial.If Screenwriters Purvis, Wade and Haggis want to reinvent Bond they need to get rid of the cheesey dialogue.",negative

It was a great movie!!!,negative
"Easily the best bond film ever. A great reboot after such crap films with brosnan, it's craig's first appearance s bond and he's amazing. He's definitely the best bond since sean connery. Really deep, focused more on the character rather than the action sequences. Great character development and amazing screenplay. Great ending, eva green is probably the best bond girl (acting-wise).",positive
"Good movie, but very long, at 2 hours and 24 minutes!",positive
A pretty sweet movie with loads of action that kicks ass. I didn't really like Daniel Craig as Bond though... He just seemed so removed from everyone and everything that it was hard to see him as the 00 agent bent to protect the country. I guess I'm just saying I've seen better 007 movies.,negative
honestly...half of this movie was a poker game...Bourne was better!,negative
"If this film rejuvenated the Bond franchise, it says a lot about how crap it was beforehand. Average, mildly entertaining action sequences in the first two thirds are all very well. But there's nothing exceptional to speak of. And then it gets into a load of romantic dross toward the end. To call this film mediocre would be flattery. It's average to poor.",negative
"The best basis for future Bond movies ever! A franchise re-boot that was worth every penny to make. More realistic and emotionally motivated than any previous Bond film. Daniel Craig could drop a smile or two once in a while to really cap the Bondness of his portrait, but other wise....OUTSTANDING!",positive
"It was lame. James Bond in love?! What a shame! But I like Daniel Craig. He IS a James Bond. Eva Green is gorgeous but dosent look like a Bond Girl. And about the story its neither a spy movie one nor an action. Besides you dont see much of british humour or inteligence which's supposed to make a Bond story. You can go take a piss during the poker scenes and Craig-Green dull dialogues. And all shit that you're compelled to hear at the end of movie about Vesper deed to let Bond live was nonsense. I think it was an unsuccessful attempt to change James Bond foolish-but-attractive movies into a serious logical movie like Bourne Identity. Wow! Oh God! How perfect Bourne Identity is. But dont forget about Daniel Craig. He is the Bond! I just hope a better director and scriptwriter make the next one. BTW, why was it this much long? There were 3 or 4 times that I thought it would be the end, but the drag was going on.",negative
My favourite movie :),positive
"Une nouvelle generation de spectateur a acclame Casino Royale comme le meilleur Bond de la saga ; mouais... Perso a moitie convaincu, par Craig d'une part (qui s'il est bon acteur ne colle pas necessairement a l'idee que l'on se fait de l'espion britannique au martini), par l'ensemble de la realisation d'autre part : plus de gadgets, plus d'humour, de l'action brute style Jason Bourne... Un bon film de divertissement mais un James Bond assez moyen.",negative
"Il aura donc fallu attendre ce film qui suscitait une franche mefiance pour diverses raisons pour donner une nouveau souffle a un heros dont les peripeties commencaient - une fois de plus - a tourner en rond. Episode fondateur du mythe James Bond, Casino Royale ne bouleversera cependant pas les caracteristiques traditionnelles de la franchise : il s'agit une fois de plus d'un blockbuster Action a tres grand spectacle, accumulant courses-poursuites endiablees, combats haletants et sequences bourres d'effets speciaux qui en mettent plein la vue (la scene finale est a ce titre un veritable cas d'ecole). Neanmoins, Casino Royale parvient a se demarquer et a surclasser avec une certaine facilite les derniers volets avec Pierce Brosnan. Tout d'abord, les gadgets sont moins grossierement mis en avant que dans les films precedents, et Casino Royale y gagne en credibilite. Ensuite, tout genereux qu'il soit en plans a 100000 $, le coeur du film est constitue par une partie de poker, par definition assez statique, mais qui n'en possede pas moins un cote hypnotisant. Enfin, et c'est peut etre le plus important - Daniel Craig, avec sa gueule de sous-marinier sovietique mangeur d'enfants, incarne un Bond d'un nouveau genre, ou plutot incarne LE Bond tel que Ian Fleming l'avait imagine : un tueur a gages froid et impitoyable, a l'arrogance bien eloigne de l'esprit snobinard mis en avant par Brosnan. Tous ces elements font en tout cas de Casino Royale un tres grand cru des aventures de James Bond et un prequel remarquablement travaille qui eclaire le personnage d'un jour nouveau. Vivement la suite !",positive
"I'm not usually a fan of action/spy movies, but this one exceeded my expectations. Still, what was up with that bizarre ball-whipping torture scene? And what was up with Bond's pseudo-daddy relationship with Vesper, a woman clearly two decades younger than him? This is one psychosexual Bond movie.",positive
excellent film and have seen the new one as well. Daniel Craig is an excellent bond,positive
"Started off good but fell asleep halfway through, that must say something??",negative
"Le James Bond parfait. Daniel Craig renvoie tous les prÃ©cÃ©dents au placard; James Bond enfin dans le 21Ã¨me siÃ¨cle a laissÃ© tomber les vieux gimmicks des 60's. Le scÃ©nario est dense, la mise en scÃ¨ne nerveuse, Eva Green est somptueuse, et Daniel Craig.... comment dire.... je ne m'en suis pas encore remise!",positive
"very nice Bond movie... Im surprised so many hated this.... awesome action, story and drama... getting ready for Quantum of Solace!",positive
"James Bond was feared to have met his end with the Cold War a part of history in the 90s and as such, few saw any potential left for Agent 007 in the realm of film making. If it was to be done however, it was certainly seen as the biggest challenge yet, aside from the constant cycling in of newer, younger agents to play the role of Bond. With the departure of Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig had quite the challenge of living up to the good ol' days of the critically raved ""GoldenEye"" and, to be fair, he and the rest of the ""Royale"" team get damn close to perfection. We see a Bond unlike any other, will a real emotional connection that sets the stage for his future persona, portrayed all to well by Craig, not to mention the equally good acting by the rest of the cast. The action is as good as ever and the plot itself is fairly original, if somewhat predictable. The predictability is a minor complaint though, when compared to the schism of pace that occurs after the torture scene. It seems the film loses steam all to quickly at this point and by the time things of importance start happening again, you're confused as to what's gone on altogether during all that downtime of storytelling. Regardless, if there's anything that might shed some relief on the confusion, it's the promise that Craig's Bond has a bright future ahead with the sequel ""Quantum of Solace.""",positive
Generally not a bad movie... but the Bond-series turns more and more in a dull season of action movies.,negative
"Casino Royale was my very first Bond film. As such, it is one of my favorites. The movie was stylish, smart, and interesting. Craig, in my opinion, really delivers as a cold and indifferent Bond who isn't yet the suave and efficient one I've come to know. He's new to his role of 007 and because of this, needs to grow into the image. Albeit, Craig is very exciting to watch and delivers quips with ease at even the most tense situations. It does stretch out a bit, and it could have cut down the poker scenes a bit, but if you're truly caught into the film, it shouldn't be a big problem. The villain is one of my favorite Bond villains so far. He's ruthless yet desperate, threatening and clever. An ideal villain. The love interest in this addition to the Bond franchise is not as easily won over as previous Bond girls. The action scenes are well done, and the movie pays attention to some staples in the Bond franchise while making some innovations of its own. I eagerly await Quantum of Solace this November.",positive
I know critics are slating this but I really enjoyed it. You really believe that Daniel Craig as James Bond has the right to kill which was never the case with Roger Moore. More hard man than gadgets.,positive
best james bond movie ever,positive
One of the best Bond movies ever made. Daniel Craig blew me away.,positive
"Finally, someone breathes some life into Bond again...",negative
"Espectacular, al fin se avivaron y metieron seriedad en la franquicia , gracias a bourne, revitalizaron a bond. La historia esta muy bien llevada y cuidada",positive
"It's been a while since I've seen a Bond movie as fresh and amazing as Casino Royale. Daniel Craig took over the role of 007 and he did a damn fine job. This movie has also one of the best stories ever written for the series. Le chiffre, who is the main villain, offers an unforgettable performance. Daniel Craig is here to stay.",positive
"Maybe the best Bond so far. Daniel Craig is the man, way better than Brosnan.",positive
Really freaking good......... the best James Bond movie that I've seen..... little emphasis on sex (thank god!) and loads of action!!!!! I was super impressed - can't wait to see Quantum of Solace!,positive
Daniel Craig makes an awesome young Bond... that first chase scene in the movie is f'ing AMAZING.,positive
"Catch it on Blue-ray at 67's pad, all I can say is.... ""WOW"" Different kinda bond and this is what a REAL agent should be like",negative
Liked that the love interest dies actually....,positive
"This is what the James Bond should be like. Very faithful to the idea of Ian Fleming's novels, with Bond being cold and arrogant. Eva Green is such pure sex on legs.",positive
absalutley brilliant,positive
I LOVE 007!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"Heh....I just watched this again the other night, and I discovered that I really like this movie. =) I liked the beginning in black and white...I liked the chase scene....I really liked the shower scene because it's original and interesting (except that he eats her fingers..........<.<) and I liked the change in cinematography style throughout the movie. (The way the cardiac arrest part was filmed...hehe...) All-in-all, this is probably one of my favorite movies...it has the perfect balance between rugged action movie and suave spy movie. =)",positive
The best Bond since the early days with Connery. This guy is a killer.,positive
"Slick, hard, visual, and reminiscent of Bond of old. Craig takes the franchise on, with enough retro to be classic and to the minute. While Connery holds a place as a favourite Bond, he may now have moved a place down in line.",negative
"I was never really into James Bond movies. To me, they were all WAY too corny! THIS however was a GREAT 'reboot.' It does go on a little long, and since I'm not really ""in to"" the Stock Market and card playing - the story tends to bog down a bit for me, but it is well paced with some GREAT chases and action sequences - overall I think this is a good start to revitalizing the Bond franchise.",positive
"Love it love it love it. Trunks, they're the new Aero advert ye know",positive
i love carsino royal is the best,positive
"Cute and boring. I couldn't even take it seriously, though it wanted me to.",negative
"Not a typical Bond film, still prefer Pierce Brosnan. But a good action movie though!",negative
had doubts with this coz i kinda liked brosnan then but craig's so amazing as bond!! charming and actually convincing in his fight scenes.,positive
"Brilliant movie. The only thing I can put my finger on is the romance. Too many feelings for a Bond movie! But i really liked it. Great story, great acting (Go Mads Mikkelsen!) and Daniel Craig is actually the perfect Bond! It's very difficult to follow Pierce Brosnan but Daniel Craig does it perfectly!",positive
"Very good reboot of the Bond franchise. Daniel Craig is tough, suave, and so very English all the way through. Probably the best Bond since Sean Connery. It was a little weird watching him go soft for a woman, though. And I spent the last 20 minutes of the film wondering if he'd lost his penis in that torture chamber or not. You should never have to wonder whether Bond is 100% cock. Overall, good story. Incorporates all the Bond elements you'd expect but with an updated edge and a little more realism than the usual. Makes crap like Moonraker look merely farcical. Too bad Quantum of Solace was such a POS. I wonder what will happen next.",positive
"I finally got to see this movie!!! after such a looooong time.....i don't even know why i never watched it in the first place, when daniel craig is one of my super crushes...drool...drool...i watched all the pierce brosnan bond movies but dang!!! daniel craig is the sexiest bond ever....he made bond look more human...i liked the plot here better than all the brosnan bond movies combined...now i'm excited to watch quantum of solace....",positive
"DVD, watched it over again, in preparation for the new bond that was just released. Was fun but did not like the idea of destroying a austin martin. dont like the ending but action was cool.",negative
"Just as entertaining on repeated viewings, this reboot of the Bond franchise works on every level",positive
"It deserved a 3 because it wasnt one of the best, but still worth the watch.",negative
The Best Bond movie so far and that is because the movie had a story this time and no gadets,negative
Bond back with a BANG!!. Brilliant from start to finish.,positive
Great soild james bond movie it brought back some of the true feel of the novels that was missing.,positive
"So this was how Bond got burnt. I still prefer the older Bond movies where he actually saved the day, using cool gadgets and all.",negative
"The great thing about this Bond film is the characters humanity, flaws, but overwhelming passion to ""get the job"" done. Great film-making and who can deny the talent of Judi Dench. She gets more done in less screen time than anyone I know. I want that CAR!",positive
"An absolute and fresh new start for the James Bond franchise. I never liked JB movies, specially Brosnan's. But Daniel Craig plays a perfect role, combined with an excellent an exciting plot. Eva Green looks great as well. Indeed, a must-see.",positive
I'm sorry. That last hand... nearly killed me...,positive
Gritty Bond flick that's missing the usual cool gadgets. Craig looks more like a baddie!,negative
"doesn't care whether it's James Bond or Jason Bourne for me, this is a solid action movie",positive
"Fantastic adaption of the book with an awesome new Bond... The best, another two films this good and he'll replace Sean Connery as my favourite!",positive
Probably the best Bond film ever. No stupid shit. Nothing played for laughs. The attention to detail in the foot chase is amazing and the fight in the bathroom is brutal. Awesome!,positive
"I love the action in this movie. I don't care for the overt womanizing that seems to be one of Bond's characterizing traits. Some plot twists were very predictable, but Craig is definitely my favorite bond (not counting Sean Connery.)",positive
I watch this and at times I have flashbacks to The Cincinnati Kid,negative
"magnifica recuperacion de bond, con varios topicos rotos!!! buen guion, una tensa trama, y un daniel craig enorme!!! se hace un pelin larga... pero la emocion esta asegurada!!! al final uno corre el riesgo de sentir la desolacion q siente el propio agente oo7...",negative
I'm not the biggest Bond fan but I really enjoyed this.,positive
What a great reboot to a sagging franchise!,positive
not like all james bond movies but loads of action,positive
"Having never been a fan of bond films in the past it was with some trepidation i sat down to this one. Wow was this really bond? No silly gadgets or invisible cars, in its place was an updated stripped down bond whos more jason bourne than some of the camp superspys of the past. We have much to thank the bourne films for as bond has been dragged into the 21st century with a bang. The fighting was brutal and brilliantly choreagraphed and it needed a 15 rating rather than the 12a. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, thought daniel craig brought realism to the role and i will be a bond devotee from now on.",negative
"After the low-point of Die Another Day, the James Bond franchise was given one HELL of a serious reboot, this meant starting it all over from scratch, and getting a new Bond in the form of Daniel Craig. This has Bond earning his 00 status, and then going on his first assignment, being entered in a high stakes game of Texas Hold'em at the Casino Royale in Montenegro, against the sinister terrorist banker Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen). He's working along side the lovely treasury agent Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), Rene Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). Maybe the best Bond of the lot, it's so classy and well-made. Craig makes the role his own on his first outing, portraying an ultra-realistic Bond. It's got wonderful locations, some absolutely brilliant moments of action, and a near unwatchable torture scene!! But, Craig's Bond is a world away from the fantasy of before, and by God, it works!! :D More please!! :D",positive
Great Movie cant wait for the next one *:),positive
"Casino Royale backs up Bond's swagger with brutal intensity, courtesy of a character-driven script and Craig's pulse-pumping portrayal. The new Bond has attitude, style, and Bourne-like presence. Casino Royale does for the Bond franchise what Batman Begins did for the Batman saga: rebirth through revelation and resilience.",positive
"Every James Bond movie blew till this one came out. The way they all should have been. Hardcore, gritty, brutal!",positive
Watched it again last night in preparation for the sequel and I must say that it really is a classy Bond film.... can't wait for QoS!,positive
Este tipo me encanta!!!!,positive
"A vast improvement over the recent sputtering Bond films. Casino Royale broke the generic Bond movie where everything is the same every time. The plot was intricate and fascinating, while the actors fit their roles and their dialogue was sharp. Can't wait for Quantum of Solace.",negative
"Over the years the bond franchise has continually been lesser of a movie since Dr. No and From Russia with Love. They became unbelievable and campy with ridiculous names and things that took place. But when Daniel Craig debuted as Mr. Bond in 2006's Casino Royale he rebooted the franchise that Connery started. He was gritty, dark, and looked like he could whoop ass. He was not a womanizer Bond that we grew accustomed to, but just a straight-forward BADASS. He was cold and ruthless, and yet still, he was human. He could be injured, something the past Bonds never had. No gadgets, no flying cars, no space travel. This Bond lived and breathed in OUR world. And thats what makes this 007 flick, the best.",positive
greatest Bond movie hands down!!,positive
Awesome. Daniel Craig shirtless - Need I say more?,positive
"The thing is, I have NEVER been a Bond fan. Until this Bond. Craig is truly the meaning behind hardcore bond. Sweet action sequences, lovely cars, and intrigue throughout. It's a spy movie worth owning.",positive
"My name is Bond, James Bond... Soguk savas sonrasi casus filmlerine yaratici senaryo yazÄ±lamÄ±yor maalesef.",negative
I hate James Bond...,negative
The best 007 movies so far !,negative
Certainement l'un des meilleurs Bond Ã  ce jour. Daniel Craig est vraiment crÃ©dible en Bond dÃ©butant en tant qu'Agent 00. Le scÃ©nario est bien ficelÃ©. Que du bonheur !,positive
Daniel Craig...just what can I say?,positive
"A new ""Gritty"" Bond. Fair enough, great acting, but is it really Bond? I like the camp Bond's, I have to say",positive
"Even as a Connery loyalist, I think Craig crushed it.",positive
I love how Bond has been rebooted.,positive
Un bon film d'action mais James Bond n'est plus vraiment James Bond. L'humour et les gadgets sont passÃ©s aux oubliettes et Daniel Craig campe un James Bond froid et brutal. Les amateurs de 007 risquent d'Ãªtre dÃ©Ã§us.,negative
I remember seeing this in the cinema and coming out very dissappointed but I've just watched it again and it seems one star better than it was before - now I'm off to watch Quantum Of Solace again to see if it will be a bit better than it was when it watched it the other day and gave it 3.5 stars...,positive
The Rebirth of Bond.. James Bond is dead .. Long Live Bond!!!,positive
"Best Bond movie for decades. Even looking forward to the next one. Craig is almost up to Connery standard. Bit darker, more conflicted. Great action combined with a good script and storyline. A rare event, indeed",positive
Overrated commercial filmmaking designed by bussiness men for film illiterates.,negative
"Awesome film, the best film since Goldeneye and really kicks Daniel Craig's critics in the nuts.",positive
SHOW ME NEXT THE LITTLE MERMAID TO RATE,negative
"In recent times, movies have been able to do pretty much whatever they want and can. This Bond movie proves that, shoving in as much action and CGI as they can in the $150mil budget. Saying that, Royale has some superb action scenes, but watching it you don't get the feel you're watching an actual Bond movie. When you compare this in Bond style to Goldfinger or From Russia, you don't get a positive result. But as a movie, Daniel Craig shines as just another hitman in a plot similar to a James Bond story.",negative
"Absoluty fantastic series reboot, telling the tale of James Bond's first mission as 007. It is refreshing to have a bond movie grounded reasonably in reality rather than having some Autin Powers esque super villain with a funny stuffed cat. Intense action and a well told storyling just about put this above the recent sequel.",positive
"Pretty badass, much better than the Brosnan films, still not as good as Connery.",positive
"A much, much darker Bond beginning his journey into the 00 role... Less fantasy action, more dirt and blows and pain... Good debut as 007 for Daniel Craig...",negative
"Rebooted, re-invented, re-invigorated - a sh*t-kicking Bond is just what we need now - builds the anticipation for Quantum of Solace very nicely",positive
I was caught off guard at first with a blonde haired blue eyed Bond. This portrayal is very different then how Sean Connery originaly presented it. Daniel Craig brings a more hard-core Bond to the screen which builds more suspense then i have seen in any of the previous movies which in my opinion makes Daniel Craig the best Bond since Sean Connery.,positive
"Daniel Craig is an awesome actor, love him as bond",positive
"Quite possibly the best Bond movie EVER! A complete reset of the Bond franchise, so ignore everything that has gone before. This Bond is more vicious and self reliant so don't expect any gadgets.",positive
Enjoyed this. More like the book Bond.,negative
"Une sympathique dÃ©couverte de la saga Bond : un hÃ©ros sauvage, un peu d'action, un peu d'amour et une sacrÃ© partie de poker ou on voit la complexitÃ© du jeu.",negative
one of the worst bondmovies that I have seen,negative
"Had to rewatch it today for the sake of QoS. :) It's honestly the best Bond movie ever made. I've seen them all (several times) and I love the old ones, especially with Sean Connery, but this beats them big time. I love that they made Bond more human. Daniel Craig had a huge pressure on his shoulders and he did AMAZING job. Can't wait till Quantum of Solace!",positive
Daniel Craig is brilliant as Bond helped by a great movie with a good storyline balanced with excellent action scenes.,positive
i think this is my favorite bond. he's bit sloppy but makes the movie looks natural. the action is great too.,positive
The finest bond film ever,positive
"First I thaught: ""Hey! That's not Bond style!"" Because it isn't. Its normal action movie. James Bond in dirty T-shirt? That couldn't happen. But then I realised that this is a movie about how James Bond became 007 Bond, James Bond. Adn that's great.",positive
Not a bad movie but very long winded and full of mistakes. The biggest mistake in the movie was Judi Dench in the movie as M when we all know that this bond is a prequal and Judi Dench wasn't interduced into the Bond world antill Goldeneye. A very silly mistake.,negative
Great action but not enough. Kept me interested anyway.,positive
"Great for an intriguing action film. Good for a Bond film. A bit disappointing when compared to the source material. Some moments from the novel are unnecessarily understated, while others are rewritten into extravagantly sensationalized sequences. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film, especially the last hour, but I couldn't help feeling that it could have been done better. The writing felt rushed, as if shortcuts were taken. The cinematography at times felt edgy, while at other times it felt sloppy and inexperienced. The acting, namely that of Daniel Craig, just didn't hit the mark; his delivery wasn't always convincing, and his appearance and mannerisms didn't precisely embody the legendary character, although some of that is sadly due to genetics. Criticism and negativity aside, this is still a good installment into the historied Bond Film Franchise and one such as myself looks forward to only seeing improvement when James Bond Returns in Quantum of Solace.",negative
"Craig.. Daniel Craig.. This movie has become my favorite Bond film. I like the fact that they have seemed to ""reset"" the Bond mythos, leaving them ample room to explore the character. I'm glad they focused on the action more than the gadgets, as sometimes the toys almost made the films seem silly. I'm looking forward to 'Quantum of Solace'. Bravo to Craig for adding more depth to Mr. Bond.",positive
"Oh yeah. It seems like they have finally put some life back into Bond, and made him a true action hero rather than a caricature with this one. Daniel Craig was a damned fine choice. I caught this again in preparation for the next later this month. Can't wait. Only complaint was the writing sometimes faltered, particularly where love scenes were concerned, and it was a little slow in the middle.",positive
"Incredible, a decent James Bond film...",negative
bond is reborn... again,negative
"The Bond formula had grown incredibly stale after the overblown, silly and fairly awful Die another Day. Enter Daniel Craig and Casino Royale, giving the formula a much needed shot in the arm and a complete reboot. Taking Bond back to basics and back to the beginning, Casino Royale eschews the double entendres and silly gadgetry for a more realistic and gritty feel. This is down to a mixture of Bond's past and future; the past being Goldeneye director Martin Campbell, back in the helm, and the future being the newest 007, Daniel Craig. Ignore the idiots with their Craignotbond websites and revel in Craig's performance; gritty, physical and impressive. He handles the action with aplomb, and he's helped by director Campbell and his superb stunt team. Chases up scaffolding and cranes, car chases, brutal fist fights and collapsing Venetian buildings are just some of the action you can enjoy. A more realistic and relevant James Bond, featuring perhaps the best Bond performance since Sean Connery and the best Bond film since Goldfinger. Bold, brutal and brilliant, Casino Royale showed there's life in the old franchise yet.",positive
"En välkommen nystart för Bond-serien med en ny agent i remake på en gammal historia. Det mesta av glamouren är borta och kvar finns den oslipade, brutala Bond som behövs för att man ska orka bry sig efter så många filmer. Daniel Craig är perfekt för rollen. Kul.",negative
A great movie that is a refreshing change from the few previous films.,positive
Reviving the dead series in a big way.,positive
"James Bond rebooted : on efface tout on recommence. Casino Royale raconte la premiere mission de Bond, fraichement promu au rang de ""double 0"". Un vrai bon film d'espionnage... cela dit par quelqu'un qui a toujours detestÃÂ© les films de James Bond !!! Ici, pas de gadgets neu-neus, pas de gonzesses, que de l'action !",negative
"Un bon retour aux sources avec un Bond faillible, moins accro aux gadgets et un sacrÃ© p'tit cul ;-)",positive
"not bad. a new age of bond begins here. orignally i thought the only way to go forwards with bond was to go backwards to the 60s, which is where bond ultimatly belongs- but remember bond is always very now and it would just imitate the connery era too much.. like the daniel craig bonds do anyway what with the suit and everyting else.",positive
A fantastic new direction for the James Bond franchise. Its more gritty than before but still has hot classy ladies and fast paced action. A must watch.,positive
"Very good bond movie. Reinvented for the 21st century, and in many ways much better. This film had more character and less of the cheese of previous bond movies whilst still being entertaining.",positive
"Tout simplement excellent ! A tous les niveaux. D'aucuns regretteront peut-etre un certain manque de rythme mais l'histoire est tres bien ficelee, la realisation ne s'embarasse pas d'effets de style superflus et Daniel Craig est epatant et charismatique en Bond brutal et sur de lui. Il fallait bien ca pour faire oublier Moore, Dalton et Brosnan... Meme si ""Die another day"" avait deja redresse un peu la barre, et que ""Golden Eye"" (du meme Campbell) avait aussi bien relance la ""machine"" Bond apres les peu glorieuses 80's... Face a Craig, Eva Green n'est pas du tout un faire-valoir, elle est son parfait alter EGO. Apparemment pour ""Quantum of solace"", ils n'ont pas creuse ce sillon et ont plutot mise sur l'action...",positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever.,positive
thi version bond is awesome,positive
"Nice movie, i was so touched about the romance part....",positive
The best Bond ever !!! Can he follow it up....,positive
"There is only one true Bond and that is Connery. Craig however impressed me in terms of being a completely different and new Bond; Moore always had that glimpse in his eye, Lazenby... let's not go there and Brosnan I suppose was an attempt at recreating Connery's charm 30 years later. Playboy Bond if you will. Craig however displays two sides of Bond; the cold agent and the very human being. The story - whilst not the most intriguing - is simple enough. I personally found the character of Bond and the developments inherent there more interesting than anything else. God he must have felt heartbroken at the end...",negative
I love Daniel Craig as the new bond. I love the direction they went with him as a hard ass tough guy. It's about time the producers get back to the Connery style of bond. I think they did it.,positive
in my top 5 action movies,positive
"With the new Bond flick hitting the Cinemas this weekend I thought it time to revisit the first one. Officially the 21st Bond film. But that is the wrong way to think about it. This one goes back to the beginning. And revitalizes and makes Bond more of a dangerous man then he had ever been before. Which Daniel Craig pulls with a ease... A surefire shot in the arm for a franchise that was struggling with ideas. It still has all the Bond trademarks. But it works them through with such a fresh spin, it seems like an original idea. and in a world where we now have Jason Bourne among other Spy movies and spoofs that is a tremendous accomplishment. Bring on the next one... I can't wait to see it on the big screen next week. All hail Bond. Still the king of cool when it comes to Spy movies",positive
"I was dubious about Daniel Craigs portrayal of Meester Berrrnd,but was really impressed.",positive
Fairly faithful adaptation.,positive
Best Bond movie the franchise has produced.,positive
watched it when it's aired on tv. althou i think daniel criag looks really old for this role but i must admit he did a pretty good job as d cold n brooding bond.,negative
One of the best Bond movies!,positive
Good plot n betrayal.,negative
Don't like him as a James Bond as his face is so expressionless. But this film was properly watched by me 2days ago and you know what this film is awesome! I take my words back 11/12,positive
Daniel Craig taistelee kyllä kovasti parhaan Bondin paikasta Conneryn kanssa.,positive
"Despite being the best looking Bond film, the visuals cannot cover up the cracks in the script. Despite it's tag as Bond's first outtings after his 00 status, the script often treats him like a veteran in his field. And despite being well match to the film's style, Craig just doesn't quite cut it as Bond; the man lacks any warmth and charm and just makes it impossible to believe his connection with Vesper Lynd. A valiant effort but doesn't match the production's main target, Jason Bourne.",negative
Loving the new Bond - can't wait for the next instalment.,positive
One of the best films in recent years,positive
What a film!!! AWSUM!! Go Daniel Craig! :D,positive
"Excelente, el regreso del Agente 007 Bond James Bond, despues de Pierce Brosnan, pensÃ© que no seria fÃ¡cil encontar uno que de la talla, sorpresa, y agradable, una version moderna super diferente pero buenisima, obvio para los fans de Bond.",positive
Still haven't watched the whole thing but what I did see - I disliked. So I have no hope of actually gaining confidence to watch the whole thing. Daniel Craig just doesn't push the James Bond thing. PLUS I think James Bond has been worn down now - it was good in it's PRIME now it's over... :( The games remain more alive.,negative
"The most violent Bond I've seen. Not a huge fan of the series, but I still can't wait for the next Daniel Craig Bond movie coming!",positive
"my favorite bond film. i wouldn't change a thing. god, eva green is so smoking hot! and daniel craig, great bond. cheers all around!",positive
Love it- still think he looks like a sack of spuds though!,positive
"<i>''The name's Bond. James Bond.'' </i> In his first mission, James Bond must stop Le Chiffre, a banker to the world's terrorist organizations, from winning a high-stakes poker tournament at Casino Royale in Montenegro. <b>Daniel Craig</b>: James Bond <i>''I'm sorry. That last hand... nearly killed me.'' </i> The character of Bond presented in <i>Casino Royale</i> may disappoint followers of the original films, but the news is, this is Fleming's Bond. An orphan, uncertain of his own identity, a disillusioned romantic trying hard to pretend he's incapable of emotions, a middle class, middle-brow, middle-level management type who just happens to kill people for a living. But he does it extremely well. The other problem some general viewers may have is the level of violence in the film; having determined to film the novel realistically, director Martin Campbell has decided to ditch the 'B-movie' violence of most of the earlier films, and present us the violence with a hard British neo-noir spark to it. Given the romantic plot twist toward the end, this would be a perfect date movie also. Except that the violence left some of the female viewers in the Cinema I attended clearly scared. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it just is part of the roller-coaster of the film's antics. <i>''Arrogance and self-awareness seldom go hand in hand.'' </i> Cambell's direction is very good, the writing is crisp and clinical, production values are an all time high; the photography is beyond excellence. Some of the stunt work is truly remarkable and jaw dropping. The acting is rock-solid and believable for these characters. There is plenty of muscle for the action-film fan, and some real brains for the more intellectual viewer to ponder in the ensuing plot contrivances. <i>Casino Royale</i> is best viewed with minimal reliance on knowledge of the previous installments. In fact, it functions perfectly well as a one-off, a film without a series. It's <i>The Bourne</i> of <i>Bond</i> pretty much and it takes ideas from that series and uses them for it's own inspirational means. <i>''Why is it that people who can't take advice always insist on giving it?'' </i> The real ace here is Craig. He doesn't have Connery's raw star quality, but he's easily the best actor to have played the part for ages. I don't know if the film was shot in sequence but for the only time since <i>Majesty's Secret Service</i> you get a sense of Bond evolving throughout the film as his cockiness becomes confidence and his brutality becomes cold icy efficiency. He starts off unlikeable but human and gradually picks up the Bond traits we know and love, until he becomes more likable but just a little less human. It's an interesting journey and Craig is up to the task in hand. It's not just his delivery, it's also his body language and dedication to the mission. Even his fighting style changes as he adapts. <i>''I'm sorry I'm not sorry.'' </i> Physically he's the most in your face Bond since Lazenby and the action scenes look brutal and effective with a gritty realism long forgotten or unseen. Even the not very likely free running chase is spectacular but believable because you get the idea that this really is kill or be killed antics. It's got a real feel of danger to it that hasn't been seen in the series in years. Only the torture scene feels like it's holding back but that's probably fear of the censors. You'll come out of this one not just thinking that Daniel Craig <b>IS</b> James Bond, that no-one has ever played him before. Let's all hope they don't lose their nerve with Bond 22 and bring back the sci-fi crap and unrealistic gadgetry, because this could be a real new habit to emphasis...Roll on <i>Quantum Of Solace</i>! <i>''I have no armour left. You've stripped it from me. Whatever is left of me - whatever is left of me - whatever I am - I'm yours.''</i>",positive
"I am not a fan of Bond movies at all, and I think this is the first Bond movie that I watched properly. It is not my kind of movie and I don't have much to say, but it was entertaining.",negative
moram priznati da mi se dopao iako sam se jedva naterala da ga pustim.,negative
i dont really like bond movies but this one i liked,positive
"I was ready to hate this, but it's incredible.",positive
"Favorite Bond movie, and that's saying somethign 'cause I am a fan of the franchise. I even like all the bad ones. But Daniel Craig took it to the next level.",positive
"Bond shows emotion, is fallible and bleeds. This is the best Bond movie by an absolute country mile and Daniel Craig really stuck it to the people criticising him even before the film's released",positive
"Daniel Craig brings a darkness to James Bond that the franchise desperately needed. But he still retains the wit previous actors have shown us. You get the best of most sides, along with a interesting plot and a nice soundtrack. Simply put, a great action movie.",positive
AMAZING! I was so unsure for so long about this movie and when I was finally forced to watch it was happy with the result. Still not my favourite Bond but I am excited to see the new one now,positive
Not that great. Don't get it.,negative
Bond returns. it worked,positive
The best Bond since Sean Connery!,positive
"From Madagascar to Venice, the action and suspense doesn't stop....just like Craig's bond, which is finally one of the most loyal to Ian Fleming's iconic character. The best part about this film is that character development and details are not lost here. We see Bond mess up, get dirty and experience loss. While we may have seen all that before, it was never as realistic and gadget-free! This reboot was essential in getting Bond back to the way he was intended. He wasn't written as a gorgeous man, just a charismatic and charming rogue who started off self-serving. Intentional comedy is not needed with Bond and that's another thing that Campbell gets right. A solid and diverse cast supports a well-deserved return to a franchise that has a great future!",positive
Daniel Craig is a awesome actor,positive
bestest bond ever...so far,positive
the best james bond movie so far,positive
best bond movie ever!,positive
Yeah this was pretty good. I kinda want to rewatch it so I can see all the little details.,negative
"Man This might be my favorite 007 movie...I liked the song for it and just he whole concept of a new ""unexperienced"" james bond...i liked the women in it too : p...haha...although it might be confusing for some in certain parts in a great action flick. I cant really think of anything negative to say other than that! Cant wait for the sequal!",positive
"I liked it alot why? Pierce Brosnan wasnt in it thats why!!! Its alot more grittier, less gadgets more skill",positive
"Many pros and cons 'another' bond film. The good - less of the gimmicks, a more rugged bond, Connery style, and a return to the casino scenes with a decent story. The bad - lacking some humour, unrealistic action scenes and bring a cushion with you as it is quite long. Still one of the better bond movies over the last decade.",negative
it's BOND not shakespeare,negative
It was undoubtedly brilliant and such an excellent retake on Bond. But it did drag a bit nearer to the end.,positive
This is the Bond film I'd been waiting for since I was 16 years old.,positive
"""Now the whole world's gonna know that you died scratching my balls!""",positive
"Bond back n better then ever,best bond since connery...",positive
Man...Martin Campbell knows what he's doing. I love this movie.,positive
Not the right Bond...,negative
"Gritty, finally! This is the evolution Bond needed to survive.",negative
Probably need to watch this again as I was a late comer to this movie and I think the overhype ruined it for me. Yeah it has a more modern approach in keeping up with the likes of Bourne and that works but it then loses some of the cheese that Bond films do so well but in its own right it is a decent film.,negative
"Heureusement qu'Eva Green est là, parce que l'autre bodybuildé n'a strictement pas l'étoffe d'un James Bond",negative
good but old ones are better :) xx,positive
"Daniel Craig instantly put to bed any reservations I had about him being the new bond within the first fifteen minutes of the run time. The harder edge he brings to the role after the more effeminate Pierce Brosnan is just what the franchise needed. The free-running chase scene is thrilling to watch as Bond clumsily tries to match his quarry's pace and the poker scenes while drawn out for some people's tastes were for me, fun to watch as egos butt heads across the table. The other thing of note is that despite a rather too conveniently placed defibrillator there is not a gadget to be found. This helps create more tension as we realise this time, Bond will have to rely on good old fashioned wit and brawn to get out of sticky situations. No laser watches here.",positive
"Finally, a darker non-campy Bond movie. The romantic dialogue will make you cringe just a little, and the pacing seems a bit rushed in the last half hour. But Eva Green's stunning eyes more than make up for it!",negative
best movie I ever seen,positive
"Shems Bond is finally a tough guy again. ""Casino Royale"" shows an imperfect Bond at the start of his career, acting more as a thug than as the suave spy we're used to.",positive
I'm a little confused about how an origin story that's suppose to be set before the Cold War ends up taking place after 9/11. But aside from that...,negative
"The best Bond movie, starring the best Bond!!!",positive
It stars Daniel Craig......what else could it possibly need???!!!,positive
"Watched this again in readiness for the new film Quantum of Solace, still think its awesome and a great introduction for Daniel Craig who I thought would blow it big time as Bond but he proved me and many others wrong big time.",positive
"hmmmm .... i was sceptical, and am reserving full judgement till after QOS, but i really did enjoy it, and having watched it several times since, daniel does a very good job.",positive
Bond reboot is much needed and Craig kicks sooo much ass as Bond.,positive
"It's not getting a five from me because it is not a Bond film. Otherwise, a brilliant action film. Craig is phenomenal but not a Bond!",positive
my least favorite bond. and i'm including the one with benicio del toro,negative
"A really refreshing look at the Bond franchise. The action sequences were thrilling and original. Craig was an interesting choice, but he pulled it off - and very well.",positive
"Daniel Craig saves it on many levels, but after the opening chase sequence, it slowed down way too much for me",negative
AWESOME BOND IS AWESOME,positive
"So what's so special about this? Just another clichÃ© movie. Nothing special or new except a really, REALLY slow pace...",negative
"An awesome combination of James Bond and gambling - great plot, fantastic acting, the only thing that I didn't like about this movie was the scene where he was strapped to the chair with the bottom removed... Ouch!",positive
le meilleur james bond,negative
i dont think i like the new James Boond i got too accustomed to Pierce Brosnan,positive
It works. Although it may be different. Takes us closer to the Bond that Fleming created. Craig does OK in the role.,positive
"After a much needed makeover of the James Bond-genre, ""Casino Royale"" is much more action-driven and less cluttered with silly gadgets. James Bond displays human emotions, and has actual conversations instead of a light sprinkling of one-liners. And those who said Daniel Craig can't play Bond because he's blond and blue-eyed should be ashamed of themselves!",positive
"This one was unexpectedly good... Now that they have re-booted the series,hope to see more flicks with better action..and it was fun to see Bond sans the hi tech gadgets :)",positive
"Daniel Craig is excellent as James Bond (still not Connery), but best Bond movie in decades!",positive
"Bond is meant to be a little ""cheesey"" they have tried to make him cool and there is no need he is naturally cool the film makers are trying to hard!",negative
"Bond has been reinvented... now he's a psychotic killing machine, without any of the suave elements that defined the original Bond.",positive
Not nearly as good as I'd hoped. Would probably have helped if I liked Daniel Craig.,negative
"Not a full house, but definitely a a flush.",negative
"This is Bond as he was meant to be. Connery is classic, but that's just because he's Connery. Pierce Brosnan played a good Bond, but that was the character as he had evolved through about twenty films. Daniel Craig is the first actor to play Bond the way he was written--cold, with his emotions totally under control. The classic Bond wit is still here, but he uses it to serve a purpose, undermining his enemy's nerve, not throwing out puns for the fun of it. For that reason, this is probably the best Bond film ever. But there are other factors too....for example, this is probably the most timeless of the original Bond novels. Most of the others would need a major plot overhall to make them work in a post-cold war world. I can't wait for Quantum of Solace And just because I can't help myself...""No! No, no! A little to the right!""",positive
"Oh yes. Just watched this for the 3rd.time. I really like the ""new"" and more raw Bond. Great action, cool hero and definately nice female counterpart to mr. Bond. Some of the actionscenes are just awesome. Daniel Craig is my new Bond hero, after many years of considering the Connery Bond the best. Really looking forwardt to the new movie being released in just less than a month. Yeeeehaaaw.",positive
"This film is a stunning and much needed re-boot to the franchise. Daniel Craig gives a spledid performance, and is possibly the Bond closest to the Ian Fleming character, and makes Bond quite unlikeable and not always correct or superior, an intelligent and realistic move. The story is as faithful to the novel as possible (accounting for the change in time period), and replaces the early cold-war essence of the book with post 9/11 terrorism. The casting is first-rate and entirely inkeeping with the mood of the script. Eva Green portrays the most complex 'Bond Girl' ever, bringing a no-nonsense intelligence and much needed elegance to the difficult part. From the very beginning, there is a grittier edge to this film (due in no small part to the 'film noir' style black and white opening segment), and a renewed espionage feel harking back to the '60s, exemplied by the no-nonsense manner of Craig's executions and the lack of overt smoothness in the film, with excellent villiany from Madds Mikklesen as Le Chiffre, who weeps blood when under pressure due to a deragement in the tear duct (again faithful to the book). As Bond says at the end of the film, 'The name's Bond, James Bond'-a sure reminder that Bond is back and better than ever. The franchise is in safe hands for the forseeable future.",positive
"Neat action, great performance",positive
Not the best one by far.,negative
Just an awsome movie from start to finish . I started to get worried that they would'nt play the James Bond theme song but they did not cease to impress at the end. The beginning chase scene was very creative with action seqeunces that were beyond my train of thought. The new Bond did very well for the first of his carrier.Daniel Craig is overall a very good new character for the role.,positive
Best Bond Ever? Perhaps.,positive
I LOVE THIS MOVIE YES!,positive
The best Bond movie ever made. Daniel Craig lights up screen!,positive
"Daniel Craig is a perfect Bond, though I wasn't so sure at first. Crazy action scenes and a good twist at the end. Definitely recommend.",positive
Now that's what I call a secret agent. The action was gr8... Daniel Craig acted the hard man so well that I was not convinced he would have been so easily broken for love...,positive
"Great movie, Great series, Always luv to watch a Bond movie, The original Casino Royal was ok but this one takes the cake, Welcome back Mr. Bond (Craig) you rank up there with the best of them, Conery, Moore and Brosnan.",positive
"Gritty and a little dark, excellent",positive
great action and cool cars ace movie lol,positive
"Wasn't sure to start with, blond Bond? mmm I dunno, but it was a good movie, and a different Bond - nearer the Bond in the books - so I'm told. The car chase coiuld have been much longer but that's about the only quibble.",positive
"Menurut gw, 007 paling keren, dan leganya, Daniel Craig berhasil menjadi agen 007 di luar kritik miring para penggemarnya..proyek reboot yang berhasil membuat james bond 007 terlihat berbeda, macho, keras, tapi tetep ga kehilangan charmnya ke cewe. tensi yang kejaga banget, walau aksinya ga terlalu banyak seperti bond terdahulu, tapi alurnya tetep asik buat diikutin..can't wait for the quantum of solace!",positive
"Not bad, but I don't like Daniel Craig's acting much. Pretty good story, but a bit predictable.",negative
"I think this may be the only Bond movie I've seen, except for Goldfinger. I'd actually like to see this again to give more details, but something about Daniel Craig really excites me and keeps me on edge. I'd like to see it again.",positive
the stunts r really amazing... i've watched this movie over n over again whenever it's on show....,positive
good bond movie... a very believable bond... i can't wait for quantum of solace,negative
"Great Bond flick. Very well done. Daniel Craig was excellent in this movie. Also, there was great chemistry between him and Eva Green.",positive
"I've got to say I haven't seen this movie for a long time, and I'm pumped as hell for Quantum of Solace!!! If the sequel is better than this I might just give another 5 out of 5 rating, and thats almost unheard of. This movie so far is my favorite Bond film. I found the other earlier ones a little too sci fi or unrealistic. I'm definately going to have high expectations out of the sequel and can't wait to review it.",positive
"First of all I must say that I have never been a fan of the Bond franchise (except for the Sean Connery movies), but this time I must confess that this movie made me wait eagerly for the next one! Daniel Craig is what makes this movie awesome, fresh and much better than almost all other Bond movies.He is definitely the best Bond in decades, bringing cool-blood acting, energizing action scenes and pure ruthless. The plot also differs from the latest movies, getting rid of the boring ""Bond gadget"" and bringing in enough tension and intrigue in the story.Without any doubt this is the best Bond movie in decaded if not the best ever!",positive
The best James Bond movie since Sean Connery.,positive
best james bondage ever.,positive
Best Bond ever! One of the best Bond movies ever!,positive
"I never was a Bond fan. I think James Bond was always ridiculous. And even more ridiculous was the fact, that all those movies were (are?) such a big, big deal. This was the first (and only, as for now) Bond-film, where I thought ""this is action at it's best!"". And not just some loud, mindless action, but also very thrilling, brillant and very entertaining. And I think Daniel Craig fits very well as Bond, because all the others were clydesdales with some ridiculous gear. Craig looks obviously good too, but he also looks more believable. I believe that everybody, that has the same opinion on all the other Bond-films as me, will finally like this one. I do. I really like it.",positive
Best Bond ever (film & actor) Frickin' great!,positive
"Though it's fucking amazing in nearly every single aspect, most importantly it makes James Bond a HUMAN, and not just a character...something that I've yet to see any other Bond film accomplish.",positive
Daniel Craig rocks as 007.,positive
"i've never been a bond fan (too pretty boy, not credible as agent, etc.)....however, from my perception of 007, daniel craig put his stamp on this role. the writers made him an anti-bond. an aggressive, emotionless agent....that's credible.",negative
"Ruined the entire James Bond series.... disappointing, little action, lots of drama, long casino scene. The actor has potential, but has not shown it, and this movie has little James Bond characteristics. If you ask me, the last James Bond film was Die Another Day...",negative
Better than the previous one (had to be) but not all it was hyped up to be. May have been better had I fancied Daniel Craig.,negative
Second best film I have seen this year. Daniel Craig is great as Bond brings a whole new character.,positive
Daniel Craig is right there with Connery as greatest bond ever,positive
The only Bond film I've enjoyed which doesn't involve women with crushing thighs.,positive

Danial Craig is real and honest. He was the best choice for today's bond,positive
very enjoyable Bond flick,positive
"My first Bond film actually. As such most of the references were beyond me. Reminds me of how I have to learn Poker. Daniel Craig is yummy. Judi Dench is once again, utterly charming",positive
H prwth apostoli tou bond. mia tainia xwris gadgetakia pou klanoun keravnous,positive
"Action Action Action!! I personally think this one is a lot better than the previous one, where the new bond relies less on techology and more on close combat, therefore more intense fighting scenes and probably torturing ones as well. Emotions is also a new aspect that they're included, making bond now less of a robot, something that I prefer.",positive
I would like to review my rating from 4.5 to 5 stars after i watched this movie for the 2nd time in DVD.,positive
Daniel Craig is one of the best Bond,positive
"Daniel Craig makes an excellent Bond, and stylistically the new direction of a grittier tension in the aesthetic is something I welcome. While it could have gone further, it makes me warmly anticipate Quantum of Solace. The opening credits were a nice change also, but unfortunately the Chris Cornell song ruined them!",negative
"it was an ok film, but we all know bond to have gadgets and lots of them, thats where this film was a let down. id recommend reading the book as that is brillient and much better than the film.",negative
A new james bond movie. I was really worried what it would be like but it was actually really really good. it still had the classic elements of bond but was brought into the 21st century!,positive
"Am I the only one that was confused as shit with this movie. The synopsis told me more than I could understand. Who is with who, why do we have to play poker so goddamn much, and where are all these places he is just hanging out at and why does he trust these random people. Craig seems to be a confident Bond, but I am not sold he was any better Pierce Prosnan or even Roger Moore. I was told this movie was great, and all I saw was a good action movie. Nothing more.",negative
By far the best Bond movie. Of course that's not saying much...,negative
"Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond, and Judi Dench is inspiringly cast as M.",positive
Definitely one of my favorites. Some of the stunts in this movie were just insane. I love poker too,positive
"Giudico questo film da non appassionato di James Bond, anche se, qualche altro film dedicato alla spia piÃ¹ famosa del mondo l'ho visto. Meno fantasioso, molto piÃ¹ vero e duro, questo capitolo colpisce nel segno. A fare centro perÃ², prima di tutto, sono gli interpreti, Daniel Craig Ã¨ fantastico, il personaggio gli calza a perfezione e il suo magnetismo Ã¨ stupefacente. Anche Eva Green si conferma ad altissimi livelli, bravissima e bellissima. Ma Ã¨ tutto il cast ad essere in parte e a non stonare mai. La sceneggiatura Ã¨ l'altro punto di forza del film, coadiuvata da una buona regia, colonna sonora precisa e scenografie da urlo. Se qualcosa si puÃ² criticare a questo film Ã¨, forse, l'esagerazione di alcune sequenze ma, altrimenti, non sarebbe Bond.",positive
"I've not seen every Bond movie, but this is by far my favorite.",positive
"IndrÃ¸mmet, jeg har ikke en gang en ynglings Bond film. Hvilket vel egentlig diskvalificerer mig til at anmelde filmen. Mine stjerne siger alt. Jeg fÃ¥r dog lyst til at rejse til Montenegro og ikke mindst Venedig - at hoppe pÃ¥ et tog til Stazione di Venezia (dreaming)",negative
"Absolutely fantastic film. A must see just like all the other Bond films. A lot of action and some not realistic but its a bond film, whats not to like?",positive
"A very good Bond movie that cuts down on the crazy gadgets and tries to stay within the realm of believability (Although I must say, I did miss Q). Daniel Craig fills the Bond shoes admirably and Judi Dench is still great as M. My only real complaint is the first chase scene. As cool as it was, it went on far too long and I lost my suspension of disbelief. But that is a forgivable flaw.",negative
"I'm not big on bond films, but this is the best one i've seen.",negative
Brilliant rebranding of the 007 franchise â best incarnation of Bond yet. And I've seen them all.,positive
"Great move. Craig is most like the Fleming Bond. This is a great film to see how Bond begins his 007 status. The action is non-stop and the story is brilliant. It's cool to see how many of Bond's characteristics and habits came from. The ending was cool, ""The name is Bond, James Bond"". I can't wait to see Quantom of Solace.",positive
"Now I feel like a traitor and a turn-coat, having disbanded Connery. I can't help that Craig is very good.",positive
"I have been a Bond Fan since the very first film, Connery was brilliant,and I really rated, Dalton and Brosnan,Daniel Craig was known as an excellent actor but general opinion was that he could not fill the Bond shoes, I reserved judgement till I saw the film, I think Craig has brought back the original hard edge to the character as portrayed in the Bond books, he could become the best Bond ever!",positive
j'ai beaucoup aimé! j'ai hâte de voir le prochain!,positive
"Taking the lead from the ultra-successful Bourne trilogy, Eon brought Bond back with a harder edge, in more credible style, with emotional layers, in this fantastic actioner which rebooted the franchise. All those who rubbished Daniel Craig as the new Bond prior to Casino Royale's release have been forced to eat their hats, as his portrayal has done more for the character than others managed to do with multiple reprises. 007 is once again the action franchise to reckon with.",positive
"Ohh,he is sooooo cute.",negative
I hate James Bond films. They're so poorly done and the actors always suck.,negative
"Say what they may, Daniel Craig is an AWESOME James Bond. This one is very good-great story, action, and acting",positive
Daniel Craig is a terrific Bond! This movie has incredible action. I'm worn out every time I watch it.,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever!,positive
"I hate action movies and I hated the newer Bond movies, but this one made my jaw drop. This movie revived my love for Bond movies, it moved from the corny Pierce Brosnan and into the dark side that the 007 character really needed. The opening chase scene alone made me fall in love.",positive
"Very enjoyable, the best Bond movie I have seen.",positive
"I thought this was too long when i first watched back in 2006. I was wrong, this film is great in all departments. The action sequences are totally thrilling, the characters are well observed and developed, particularly the villains which had started to run a bit thin thro' the Brosnan films. The locations used are fantastic and, oh yeah, Daniel Craig is a superb bond, totally ripped and looks ready to dish out pain. The introduction of a degree of fallibility into the character was well needed, so bond is now nigh-on indestructible rather than totally. I can't wait 2 watch Quantum on the 31st...",positive
"A good spy movie, but not a Bond film. I loved Bond they way he has been portrayed on celluloid - if I want the book Bond, I'll read the book. And I cannot forgive a) no number 5 for Pierce, and b) BLOND ?!? Give me a break!!!",negative
I was very surprised how good Daiel Craig was in his portrayal of Bond.,positive
"Firstly...g ga bnyak harap ama ni aktor. Taunya emang pas buat pra James Bond yg bertangan dingin, namun tetap memiliki karisma kuat.",positive
I liked it. Daniel Craig stepping into the new role which has big shoes to fill after Brosnan left. He pulls it off nicely and I loved the texas hold em influence on the film it made me want to watch even more considering I am a big fan of the game. Overall a good return for James Bond and would see another with Craig in the lead.,positive
this is a very very entertaining movie!!!!,positive
best bond film ever.,positive
Bondmaniaca (o Craigmaniaca) desde ya. Una pelicula muy sexy y muy entretenida. Espero con ganas Quantum of Solace.,negative
MISSES ONE STAR BECAUSE OF DANIEL CRAIG.HE IS A GOOD ACTOR.A GOOD ACTION FILM STAR.BUT HE IS N O T JAMES BOND.VERY GOOD DIRECTING FROM MARTIN CAMPBELL (OF GOLDENEYE AND MASK OF ZORRO FAME),positive
Best Bond. Back to the old school Eva Green is stunning and Craig brings a new 'Troubled' bond to the francise,positive
Graig's Bond is slick and badass enough to rank this as one of the best in the franchise!,positive
"I used to think, that Sean Connery was the best Bond. Now I have changed my mind: Daniel Craig Is Bond.",positive
don't hold your breath because every scene is a bang!,positive
I'm sorry but probably is the best bond,positive
A dark and stylish reboot of the previously-exhausted Bond franchise. Craig is excellent. Eva Green is nigh-on edible. Bring on Quantum...,positive
"Not quite classic bond, but still good.",negative
i enjoyed it even more the second time,positive
pretty good first effort in the Daniel Craig series,negative
"natuurlijk speelt het mee dat deze Bond zo ongelooflijk knap is, maar -als Bondfilm met de usual overdrevenheid eigen daaraan- superleuke film",positive
"The best Bond movie I've seen, and I'm not a fan, so congrats to this movie for entertaining me!",negative
This has to be the best Bond film since Connery was 007.,positive
"the new Bond is here, make way",positive
"after the debaucle that was die another day.a reimaging of the JB francise was needed n the result.one of the best bond films ever.why ? coz its true to the book itz very gritty n itz a very basic bond film wivout the needs of gadgets just stunning locations madagascar,prage,monternegro n venice.intesnce action free running,shootout in venice chapple,a car chase in a miami airport n fistfights in a hotel.also the cast is solid eva green is amazing as vesper lynd.mads mikkelesen is menaceing as le chifffe'.great support comess from dench n wrights as M n felix lighter respectivly.overall one of the best in the series cant wait for quantum",positive
Fantastic gritty re-imagining of Bond. Freaking awesome parkour chase!,positive
"Should have been called, ""Oggling Eva Green""",negative
It was not like the other Bond movies - and I'm not sure Daniel Craig was the best pick to play Bond. Julian McMahon would have worked better.,negative
"I liked that this Bond had a rough and darker side than previous Bonds, but I just couldn't get into the story. I also found Le Chiffre to be one of the weaker Bond villans.",negative
Bond at it's best. Daniel Craig fills the role that I believe Ian Fleming wanted it to be done. He is probably the best Bond in recent years - only rivaling the early Sean Connery,positive
Diferente de todos os outros 007... gostei muito desse filme. Hardcore!,positive
Daniel Craig is a bad ass Bond.,negative
"I'm not convinced. I think if you take the wry humour and general daftness away from Bond, and replace it with gritty drama, you just end up with something that's basically a Bourne film that's even more in love with itself than a Bourne film. Better than Moonraker though.",negative
"This was the first Bond movie I have watched in full, and I liked it. The action was good, the actors were good, there was some good humor, and the poker scenes were fun. I was a little confused about who the bad guys were and what they were up to, but not enough to spoil the movie.",positive

They finally figured out how to make a Bond movie an actual movie!,positive
As much as i love Daniel Craig he's no James Bond. Otherwise good movie,negative
"Boasts impressive (if not mindless) action sequences and superb casting, but to me ""Casino Royale"" never amounted to much in the story department. I still think ""Quantom Of Solace"" looks badass though.",negative
"The best Bond movie ever! Good emotions, although not very convincing decisions from a psychological point of view.",positive
"Excellent stripped-down Bond. Plot, spectacular stunts and fantasy with no silly gadgets",positive

The 1st James Bond film iv ever enjoyed!!!! And that sea scene!!! swoon!!!,positive
"Excellent film. Daniel Craig is amazing as the young James Bond. It was good to see Bond as a vulnerable man who despite his great talents, could fall in love, could be in trouble, and needed others to help him out. Eva Green is one of the most beautiful women in the world and she is a fine actress to boot. This film set up all the previous Bond character as a womanizing and suave agent beautifully. Must see for all 007 fans.",positive
"Definately the best Bond film in a very long time. The new film captures the essence of Bond as a person and breaks the campy mold of the previous films. Bond is more realistic he can be vulnerable and he doesn't always have a gadget handy to the plot to get him out. Bond is getting better. Oh yes Josh Bond was married in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" his first wife Theresa was murdered by his arch enemy Blofeld.",positive
i loved it but i cant believe they jacked upp his nuts lololol,positive
Daniel Craig could become one of the best James Bond's ever.,positive
Craig is the best Bond ever!!!!!,positive
Definately my favorite Bond movie.,positive
i really liked this one. Definitely the best one they made so far (i didn't fancy the other ones that much),positive
daniel caig - sexiest bond ever!,positive
"It may be a little long, and the gem is not as polished...but it's still a gem! Makes one want to say, ""Pierce who?"". James Bond -- reinterpreted, NOT reinvented. One of the great Bond films!",positive
New Bond makes all the difference. Graig makes this movie work. The first chase scene is really really awesome - watch it in a big theatre if you can! Aston Martin is just a killer car.,positive
"""Isn't he tasty in those swimming trunks"" is all I've heard from the ladies about this Bond. ""He's as hard as nails"" is all I've heard from the fella's. Yep the latter is true and I'm assured the former is also true. Bond has been reinvented for the naughties and given a harsher image, much to the delight of many, but somewhere along the way the creators lost the plot. Quite literally. Bond has reached his 21st and has finally become a man (21st Bond film that is). He has brutally assassinated two people and achieved his 007 status. This allows him to kill people at will in covert operations from his government. The world is full of madcap mentalists wanting diamonds or gold or some such commodities. This time around it's some weirdo who cries blood and deals arms. It should be said that Casino Royale is based on Bonds first outing as a full blown agent. This then allows the director to build his character, explaining his misogynistic tendencies and his penchant for murder. It goes a little way towards our understanding of the nature of one of the most famous and profitable film characters. But do we really care? Should Bond just be Bond? In fairness the back story is effective; it does clue us into the psyche of the man. But is it enough? The opening blasts onto the screen furiously, with some very exciting action set pieces. But from here it seems to lose its momentum. The story sees Bond entering a poker game, because he is the best player in the agency. What follows veers from dull to ridiculous. A cleverer writer may have been able to create a plausible story with twists and turns. Not here though, it's just plain boring. Like the seasons Bond always changes. He has stiff competition from the far superior Bourne movies so a new modern image is warranted. The expectations are high for the next episode in this franchise. Here's hoping the story can match the man.",negative
"Way to go, Bond! Craig is outstanding as 007, far better that Brosnan. Pure cinematic entertainment.",positive
"Liked the movie, not a big fan of Daniel Craig. I think they changed the whole image of 007 altogether. Pierce Brosnan and Sean Connery were the best!",positive
Best Bond movie ever!,positive
"Bra til Ã¥ vÃ¦re Bond, samtidig som man ikke kan gÃ¥ lei av Ã¥ se pÃ¥ Daniel Craig. :-)",negative
BEST FILM......EVER!!!!,positive
Ehhh..it was good. i liked the ninja moves it it! :O And and and.. I realllllly like who I watched it with. ;3 hehe.. <3,negative
"Good Bond film but come on, Bond would never wish to settle down with a woman. Bond has a license to kill, not a license to wed. The movie also lacked significant action scenes and the one they did have didn't really grab my attention in ways like the older films.",negative
"Good reboot of the 007 series. Seems like that's what is happening nowadays with series. ""Re-imagining"".",positive
"I have enjoyed bond films in the past but, never been a die hard fan until this film. Daniel Craig is a bad ass and redefines the 007 role.",positive
Absolutely the best Bond-movie.,positive
Il film Ã¨ stata una vera rivelazione. Uno dei migliori 007 di sempre. Finalmente un James Bond al passo con i tempi. Assolutamente da non perdere.,positive
it met most of my expectations and was probably good enough for what it was. but it easily could've been edited down below 2 hours - several useless scenes just made it drag more than necessary.,negative
Good job rebooting the franchise. The opening scene is especially effective.,negative
this movie is wonderful. it does get slow in a few places...but definately makes up for it.,positive
"this woz the first eva bond film i saw...but it awsome...as 1 of my gurd friends wud say ""ITS SOOOOOOOO GUD"" (tlkin bout matt btw) seriously thoo watch this film or else u might die of kidney failer...Ya herd me...ITS A GUD FILM OKAY??? watch it!!!",positive
"Daniel Craig gjÃ¸r en strÃ¥lende jobb som Mr.Bond her.. ""jaktscenen"" pÃ¥ starten er rÃ¥: ) Eksotiske omgivelser,en god birolle i dansken Mads Mikkelsen, og Eva Green da:P, denne er verdt Ã¥ se",positive
i didn't like James Bond untill they introduced me to Daniel Craig.,positive
2nd best bond. sean connery is #1 bond,positive
"Not my favorite Bond movie, but then they're not really aimed at me. Pluses- a smart Bond girl, exotic locations. Minuses- really really violent.",negative
More like Connery's Bond..,negative
The best actor to have ever played Bond. Excellent action and intense charisma by Craig.,positive
Daniel Craig is James Bond. Period.,positive
"I felt a little sorry for Pierce Brosnen. He was Bond inbetween Licence to Kill and Casino Royal. He never had the opportunity to play James Bond using the full potential of the character. Daniel Craig, who recieved much(unfair) loathing by fans when he was cast as the secret agent did get the chance and the result is clear to see. Casino Royal is easily in the top 3 of all the Bond movies made to date.",positive
I wasn't sure if Daniel Craig would measure up as Bond but he does a great job!,positive
"great movie, can't wait to see the next one!!",positive
This is an excellent revamp of the 007 franchise. Daniel Craig IS James Bond. Loads of action. lots of fun. a must own.,positive
"Daniel Craig's ""rough around the edges"" style of Bond acting makes him the best Bond in history.",positive
THE BEST BOND EVER!?!? Could be,positive
"noniin. sainpas tamankin vihdoin katottua. uusi nayttelija alkuun epailytti, mutta daniel craig oli kylla hyva bond, siina mielessa etta kun tama elokuva poikkesi aikalailla edellisten bondien kaavasta niin tommonen kivikasvo oli oikea mies rooliin. craig ei ollut sellanen vekkuli ja lipeva james niinkuin esim. brosnan. mutta ei toi daniel kylla taysin viela nayttelijana vakuuttanut, ihan ok, mutta ei mitaan mullistavaa. ja bondin iskurepliikit oli kylla aika huonoja. aikasemmista bond-leffoista ei ole mitaan kovain jarkevia muistikuvia jaanyt, mutta tuntui etta tama james bond oli paljon kyynisempi, synkempi ja raaempi. positiivinen yllatys elokuva jokatapauksessa oli. ikina en ole bond-fani ollut, mutta nyt tuntuu etta jopa vahan odotan seuraavaa bondia. toimintaa oli yllattavankin vahan, mutta sekaan ei haitannut, silla bond oli aika kova pelaan pokeria. ja aika vahan se naista kaatoi kuitenkin. huomionarvoista oli myos panssarilasit bondin ajamassa pyorakoneessa. mutta olihan toi bond aika kova jatka, ei ihan hitmanin tai john-kaksikon(McClane/Rambo) tasoa, mutta ehka jo seuraavassa bondissa sitten.",positive
this one was good but not great like the rest,negative
"I was not in favour of Daniel Craig as 007,l but he proves me wrong with a solid film packed with action and high level gambling scenes. His unpolished Bond is a good way to reset the saga.",positive
OMFG this was a great bond movie! Just brilliant. Daniel Craig can come out of the water in a tiny bathing suit any day if he likes... :),negative
"James Bond did nothing He just get himself caught, that's all",negative
"Best Bond. Period. Bye, bye Mr. Connery.",positive
What a fantastic reboot to the Bond series. Definitely one of my favorites.,positive
"Pretty good Bond flick. Action scenes were great, continuity left something to be desired. I was thoroughly entertained, and sometimes that's all you need.",negative
daniel craig = excelent bond,positive
"This started out very good and had alot of promise. But then it started to go downhill fast. Give me Roger Moore or Sean Connery. The poker scenes were terrible, the situations were unreal.",negative
he brought bond back from sleazy to classy,positive
the best bond since connery,negative
"I was astonished at how good this film is, and I think that's largely due to the lack of gadgetry used by bond. It's one of the best Bond flims ever, right up with Dr. No, Goldfinger, and The Incredibles (not a Bond film? Only by basest technicality).",positive
A different kind of Bond. Stands soley on its own.,negative
"I do have to give the latest Bond release the royale or should I say the royal treatment. It was popcorn entertainment at its apex. Daniel Craig plays all the right cards in ""Casino Royale"" as the new James Bond. This blonde Bond will bond with many Bond films aficionados which prefer a more rugged, menacing Bond. The film is based on the Ian Fleming novel that focuses on 007's early days. Jimmy boy's nemesis this time is Le Chiffre played by Mads Mikkelsen; Chiffre is a corrupt banker, who like most antagonists in Bond films or in all action films for that matter, do their malevolence stuff to collect a whole bunch of mula. Le Chiffre's obscure peculiarity is that he cries blood. Yes, he is Le Chief of the ""bloodshot eyes"" and contrary to popular belief not Mel Gibson. James and Le Chiffre duel it out in a cerebral casino card match and eventually in more hands-on type of matches. Eva Green plays Vesper Lend, a feminist accountant who lends her wisdom to James but initially not her body. Green is incandescent and has to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. ""Casino Royale"" stirs it up with plenty of classic Bond action sequences that are gripping and exhilarating. Director Martin Campbell's ""soup""er dexterity in constructing ""Casino Royale"" was commending. The only misfire in ""Casino Royale"" was its semi-droning screenplay. In summary, I hope you feel that my film review for ""Casino Royale"" was naught shaky and immensely stirring. **** Good",positive
"craig is very good as bond, very believable",positive
É o último livro de James Bond escrito por Ian Fleming a ter sua adaptação para o cinema,negative
The best Bond movie and the best Bond.,positive
"Finally Bond gets new life, and doesn't feel like a superhero of some sort.. Craig as Bond = Great choice, he gave the character new life. The directing, the plot and the action in this movie is really great.. Eagerly awaiting Quantum Of Solace.",positive
"As a humongous James Bond fan, I was weary, I must admit. After seeing Layer Cake shortly before this Bond was released, my fears were relieved because there is nobody that plays James with such a subtle understated cool and vulnerability with such little effort as Daniel Craig. Vesper Lynd is not only gorgeous but she's smart and extremely appealing onscreen, amazing Bondgirl. The villain as well, Le Chiffre is brilliantly played as well. All in all, the best James Bond movie ever turned out to be a new REmake of a campy old James Bond movie with what is the new standard for Bond, Daniel Craig.",positive
"No he visto las peliculas antiguas asi que no podria compararlas, pero si me parece mucho mejor que las protagonizadas por Pierce Brosnan.",negative
"Even though I've read the book 20-over years ago, I have always wondered why the Bond that I see in the movies do not match the one that I've read.. until this movie came along. The torture scene is as vivid as I could remember, and this Bond is raw and angry; just the way I like it. I can't really wait any longer for 'Quantum of Solace'...",positive
"Loved it. So what it it's not the Bond we all know, it's Bond enough to be Bond, Daniel Craig did well and the movie kicked ass.",positive
EVA Green's hot but Film was OK back 2 basics bond film,positive
love the version of Bond,positive
LOVED IT. This guy is a great James Bond. Can't wait to see the new one!,positive
My favorite actor who plays Bond and favorite Bond movie! Awesome and I can't wait for Quantum Of Solace!,positive
Daniel Craig is very good in this and I can't wait until the next one.,positive
"I'm a Bond fan so I'd say I can give a fair opinion of 'Royale'. The movie overall is a good attempt from all angles from action, plot, cast etc. This movie is much better than the previous one. Daniel Craig does a good job as 007 (if a bit of an ignorant bastard throughout). There are some serious plot holes throughout the movie though...like: who the hell is Mr White? and what is 'Ellipsis?'. The 1st bit of the movie was great, then it dried up slightly, but did have a good ending.",positive
"Bond is bad ass. This flick reinvents the franchise and yet Craig's performance is reminiscent of Connery's original tough-guy Bond. Light on crazy gadgets but hey he just got 00 status right? Fantastic cinematography, thrilling action sequences and good performances all around. Extra cool poker playing scenes if you're into Texas Hold 'Em, which I am. Can't wait for Quantum of Solace to come out!",positive
"Best Bond movie since The Living Daylights. The books are so much better, so if you love the movies try one of the books.",positive
Daniel Craig has cemented his place as this generation's Bond. A smashing success.,positive
Action movies as they should be. The two action sequences of the first half (Madagascar and Miami International) would be the grand finale of any ordinary flick. Eva Green is as hot as in Kingdom of Heaven. I'm Almost tempted to like Daniel Craig better than Sean Connery... Almost...,positive
"Just cant see what all the fuss is about. I found it quite boring, with long dull part between the (honestly) mediocre action set peices. Watched it on Blu Ray and I must admit the pq was excellent, though I wouldnt say it was going to save this movie. Just hope that Quantum of Solace will be better!",negative
Awesome movie. much much better than the last few Bond movies.,positive
"hey, this is a very good movie! and Daniel Craig is a great Bond and great actor!",positive
best james bond film so far!!!,positive
YES. A thousand times yes. Daniel Craig may be my new favorite bond. Has everything you want in a Bond mo vie with a healthy dollop of equal opportunity eye candy.,positive
superb. Bond is back to his best. Daniel Craig makes a great Bond. One of the best bond films ever.,positive
"Kawal dobrego kina akcji. I nie ma co sie rozwodzic nad tym, moze tylko to, ze wole tego Bonda, niz tych wczesniejszych, takich luksusowych, usmiechnietych, nie poobijanych.",positive
One of my favourite Bond films. For me its different approach works splendidly.,positive
"This film was the same as the other Bond films, you have cool gadgets, women, 5 people who could of ""done it"" and then them finally getting to the one who did and you have the typical ""love story line"".....which is in every freaking movie, well almost all.......lol. I DID like this one though.",negative
TrÃ¨s moyen Ã  mon avis ! Je regrette les prÃ©cÃ©dents James Bond !,negative
Pretty cool stuff. It felt like not enough was done to explore Eva Green's character. It was dark though and better than the prevous campy Bond efforts. It's getting closer to Ian Fleming's vision of Bond.,positive
"The only thing wrong is the film is a TAD too long. Aside from that, Daniel Craig is about as close to being the right bond as anyone has gotten since Connery, who is still the best, but Craig is a VERY CLOSE second.",positive
Big improvement over prior Bond movies.,negative
For all the talk of reinventing Bond for the post-Jason Bourne world I thought the action scenes were all instantly forgettable and the new gritty Bond was just an uncharismatic twat. Add in the convoluted plot and the fact most of the movie revolves around a poker game which isnt even an interesting poker game and you have a movie that is dull.,negative
this had a good plot and the acting by craig was really good. it had good action. jim bond is actually good.,positive
"Daniel Craig as the most terse Bond ever, and Eva Green is lovely with those sad, perma-racoon-eyes. Pared down to its essentials, this is an exciting, emotionally brutal, revival of an icon. It's good to see James back, just in time for a new Cold War. (Watch this as a double feature with the 1967 Casino Royale. One of the landmarks of Hollywood train wrecks.)",positive
I've been waiting for Bond to be this damn good again and oh damn was it good,positive
The Bond that never ends.,negative
"finally saw it - loved it! more physical than the originals, very good plot, great location shots",positive
"Superb and intricate-Best ever made. Daniel Craig's performance is emotionally outstanding-Eva Greene portrays the most beautifullu-intelligent Bond Girl yet-their chemistry is edgy and appealing. The film has a ""don't want it to end"" feeling. Loved it!!",positive
my favourite bond film eva!! the music rocked and long may daniel craig b bond!!,positive
"Ah, Eva Green...what more can I say? Awesome action film, easily the best in years (decades). Let's hope the next keeps the tightness up.",positive
"One of the best Bond films. Within minutes, Daniel Craig takes the 007 mantle, and makes the role his own.",negative
the best bond movie ever made in my opinion. Daniel Craig is amazing,positive
Very different to most Bond films but I'm obsessed with poker so i loved those scenes. Straight Flush hand was the biggest creampie ever.,positive
Daniel Craig is the BEST James Bond!!!!,positive
worst james bond movie ever,negative
Boring for a James Bond flick,negative
I liked Brosnan better.,negative
OH MY...Daniel Craig wearing shortie short swimming trunks is ay Dios Mio...What a man what a mighty fine man...oh and he looks so handsome in his TUX at the Casino...oh forgive me for digressing! This is the latest James Bond flick- a remake of Casino Royale which shows how Bond became a spy...Great film like all the Bond films. Daniel Craig can hold his own! Scary scene in the film is when he is drugged with digitalis and suffers ventricular tachycardia or VT and goes into cardiac arrest !!!!!!! I was on pins and needles because that is an awful feeling and you have no way of controlling it! Oh and let's not forget we get to see Bond in the nude...tortured in the basement. Two snaps up and a trip around the world...I don't have a favorite Bond film as they are all my favorites! Oh and the gadgets are amazing..so are his vehicles...Must see for Bond fans!,positive
"Bond's first mission (though inexplicably it is set in the 2000s...a start of a new canon, maybe?). It's thankfully short of the gimmicks and incredibly cheesy one-liners from the Brosnan era and hearkens back to the superior Dalton's work as the formidable secret agent for the Queen. Quality spy-film material save for the end where it seems as if the filmmakers were trying to throw in plot twists every five minutes just to see how many they could feasibly throw in there before they had to wrap things up. And Eva Green's hot.",positive
"This is okay. . . left me thinking ""now how did that work?"" at several points during the movie. Interesting, but not compelling.",negative
"The poker scenes were funny - Bond plays 5-7 suited and of course flops up and down straight flush draw, makes straight flush on turn and of course everyone else makes monster hands on the river to pay Bond off. Only in the movies lol... The story dragged on too much for my liking, but it was okay action fare...",negative
"I found this movie pretty enjoyable, but I'm not entirely sure about the direction they're going in with daniel craig. they're clearly taking a lot of liberties with the character and maybe making him a little bit too much like jason bourne, but it works on some level despite not necessarily being true to ian flemming's vision. most previous bonds were a little bit more sophisticated and self-possessed so to speak, but craig's bond appears to be governed by emotional reasoning above anything else. as the preview for the newest installment puts it, bond winds up ""blinded by inconsolable rage"", which can be an incredibly badass thing to watch at times. On the other hand, I don't really know if I'm in the mood for yet another merciless killer out for revenge, as that seems to be a common thread running through essentially every action/espionage flick in the past decade (I don't want to use the post-9/11 cliche but it's kinda true). I sorta miss living in an era where our protagonists had more interesting and nuanced motivations for their actions. we'll see where they go with it, though, seeing as the next one looks like it might be great. this one already has a lot of steps in the right direction, particularly the fact that they didn't spend half an hour introducing useless gadgets and actually spent a little bit more time on the characters. second, they wrote a female lead part that has at least a shred more humanity than most bond films allow women (but they still have a long way to go on that front). all in all it was pretty good. I'd watch it again someday.",negative
"i love james, in any form",negative
Pretty disappointing for a Bond film. It was wayyy to sappy romance wise and I'm sorry but am I the only one that finds Daniel Craig totally butt ugly? I just can't find it believable that beautiful women would want to get with him. Bond is supposed to be good looking and suave. The stunts were the only good parts of the movie.,negative
"Daniel Craig debuts as James Bond in his very first mission. Bond gets his 00 number, and learns some important lessons. Few Bond movies express the amount of emotion shown here, and few will evoke the emotions of the viewer like this one does. Craig is quite possibly the best actor to play Bond since Sean Connery, and the result is one of the best Bond movies in recent years. Awesome action, plenty of suspenseful scenes, and great plot twists. Mads Mikkelson was a perfect choice to play LeChiffre. Eva Green is stunning as the first love of Bond, Vesper Lynd. The Aston Martin returns for another run as well - nevermind the lack of Q, the gadgets and Miss Moneypenny. This is the beginning of Bond - how it should have been done. The ending is great, although completely cliffhanger. Daniel Craig has set a new standard for Bond and those who succeed him will struggle to match. An excellent movie, and a must for any fan of the Bond movies.",positive
Fantastic work from Craig to get into the role of James Bond. It really shows his lethal side than the ones we had seen from Pierce Brosnan onwards. Glad to see its re-started the Bond Franchise,positive
This just gets better every time I see it!,positive
Fantastic treatment of Bond. Bravo!,positive
"[color=white]With this, Daniel Craig's first outing as 007, The James Bond bandwagon has well and truly been brought into the 21st century. This revamping of the MI6 agent completely hits the spot and provides a twisting, emphatic and charasmatic plot that keeps you gripped until the credits...[/color] As was always going to be the case, much press surrounded the casting of a relatively unknown Daniel Craig ino the character of Bond. However, his previous roles proved he had the potential (particularly Layer Cake) and he more than stepped into the shoes of the previous Bonds... The plot takes us to numerous exotic and beautiful backdrops, at a fast pace, the plot twists and turns, unleashing new and interesting characters and gadgets... The old favourite is back with Judi Dench playing a fiery and unforgiving Em. Along with a new treasury representative in Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) Bond is joined by a stunning girl who's stubborn and secretive persona provides a match for the equally mysterious Bond. The story is centred around a terrorist (and Poker / maths expert) Le Chiffre who is an international loan shark to other terrorist / militia groups worldwide... Le Chiffre gambles $100 million of clients money and loses - to reclaim the money, he organises a prestigious $100 million poker game to try and reclaim not only the cash but the amount that will save his life, having gambled away some very dangerous people's money... The plot becomes thicker and more complex, when Bond doesnt know who he can trust and leads to Venice for a finale that lives up to the story thus far. The poker scenes are excellent, the casting of characters and in particular Bond's love interest (the very impressive and typically beautiful Eva Green) are majestic. In particular, the way in which Bonds vulnerability comes through in his sophisticated and dark character is warming and shows that there is a softer side to the MI6 agent. This latest Bond movie has completely revitalised the franchise and provided a sense of excitement regarding the next release because if it lives up to 'Casino Royale' then the movie is a sure success on both sides of the Atlantic. This is a must see for all movie goers, not just James Bond lovers, as the plot, story line and characters provide a truly fantastic movie that will keep you gripped until the very final twist. Fantastic.",positive

"excellent movie good james bond ,ovie cant wait to the next film",positive
"I had low expectations for this film. I'm a ""casual"" bond fan, I enjoy the movies but wouldn't watch a marathon of them. I enjoyed Peirce Brosnan as Bond and of course Sean Connery is the best. I thought Daniel Craig was an interesting choice and he blew me away in this movie. He is an extremly close second to Mr Connery after seeing this movie. Can't wait for Quantum of Solace",positive
Daniel Craig is sexy! It's worth watching.,negative

Glad to see that Daniel Craig stood up well to the legendary role,positive
"Bond e' tornato e stavolta in grande stile. Dimenticatevi la poca espressivita' di Pierce Brosnan e fate i conti questo biondo attore originale inglese che porta il nome di Daniel Craig. Dapprima accolto freddamente dai piu' radicali fans della saga (poi ricredutisi), Craig ci ha restituito il Bond che tutti ci aspettavamo di vedere dai tempi di Connery. Neal Purvis e Robert Wade riadattano il primo romanzo di Fleming dal titolo omonimo del film e lo collocano ai nostri tempi, e la riuscita e' indubbia. La direzione di Martin Campbell, gia'Â regista di ""Goldeneye"", ci riserva una grossa sorpresa; lui che e' cresciuto in TV riesce a rilanciare il personaggio con l'auge che ebbe negli anni '60 e ci sforna una pellicola che non lascia letteralmente fiato allo spettatore. Sin dalle prime riprese restiamo incollati alla poltrona con Bond all'inseguimento di un fabbricante di bombe che ha il volto di Sebastien Foucan, uno dei creatori del parkour, lo sport che consiste nello spostarsi nel modo piu' efficiente possibile saltando e sfruttando gli ostacoli incontrati; spettacolo allo stato puro. Da qui iniziamo ad intuire che non e' il solito Bond che ci apprestiamo a seguire. E infatti dopo la parte iniziale Campbell ci trasporta in un action-movie sempre pieno di sorprese. I combattimenti corpo a corpo la fanno da padrone e le ferite si sprecano; film di sicuro piu' cruento e spietato rispetto ai precedenti ma anche per questo molto piu' apprezzabile. Scopriamo anche un Bond pronto a svoltare, paura, dubbi e incertezza, sono caratteri nuovi, non rilevati nei precedenti protagonisti: Bond e' impulsivo, vendicativo, sensibile, ironico ma con la giusta dose di cattiveria; in una parola, un uomo come ce ne sono tanti. Essendo una sorta di prequel che azzera e fa ripartire la storia di Bond, possiamo assistere alla sua iniziazione ad agente ""doppiozero"". Il ""giovane"" Craig riesce a non essere mai fuori luogo e ha sempre la cosa giusta da dire; E' indimenticabile ed esilarante la scena in cui Bond viene torturato su una sedia dal malvagio LeChiffre, ben interpretato dall'attore danese Mads Mikkelsen. Sempre presente ""M"" che ha ancora l'autoritaria presenza dell'insuperabile Judi Dench; grande assente ""Q"" che dopo la morte del compianto Desmond Llewelyn nelle ultime pellicole era stato sostituito da John Cleese. Tra gli italiani nel cast a Giancarlo Giannini e' stato riservato il ruolo di Mathis, un dubbio personaggio corrotto, ma la sua interpretazione lascia indifferenti. Decisamente meglio Claudio Santamaria, attentatore taciturno e senza scrupoli che nel suo breve ruolo risulta credibile. Le Bond-girl di questo episodio, all'altezza e anche oltre le aspettative, sono la dolce francese Eva Green e la bella mediterranea Caterina Murino, quarta italiana nella storia con un ruolo di rilievo dopo Daniela Bianchi, Luciana Paluzzi, e Maria Grazia Cucinotta. La pellicola riserva molti meno spot sfacciati rispetto alle precedenti, anche se non manca un chiaro riferimento al segnatempo da polso di Bond, richiamato addirittura col suo nome per bocca della bella Green. Le attrezzature a disposizione di Bond sono sempre all'avanguardia, ma senza castronerie fantascientifiche. Per la vettura ""ufficiale"" si e' restati fedeli all'amata Aston Martin, praticamente creata (e piu' volte distrutta) per il film. Qualche appunto e' pero' necessario; la partita di poker e' interminabile, e trovandosi oltre la meta' del film puo' innervosire chi ha astinenza d'azione. Tuttavia senza questa sfida (che e' l'ombelico di tutta la storia) non avremmo potuto goderci il tentativo di avvelenamento di Bond e l'imperdibile epilogo. Girato in parte in Italia ""Casino Royale"" e' il ritorno del Bond in grande stile, accompagnato musicalmente dall'ottimo motivo di David Arnold e dai meravigliosi titoli di testa di Daniel Kleinman.",positive
I enjoyed this film indeed. I've seen it three times. it was wonderfull.,positive
"Bond is back in an intelligent, suspenseful, well-acted, action-packed, fun and fast-paced film that remains faithful to the novel but brings so much more. Daniel Craig may just be the best Bond yet.",positive
Almost perfect Bond.,positive
The best bond since the Spy Who Loved Me. The emphasis is on character development instead of over-the-top action sequences. Feels more like the books than most of the films ever did.,positive
Yay for the blond Bond from across the pond,positive
I liked the movie a lot - but for me it's not a bond movie,negative
"PlutÃ´t diffÃ©rents des auters James bond, mais se laisse regarder, facilement",negative
James Bond....need I say more?!?,positive
"Definitely one of the better Bond films. Good performances, terrific action...and something which all the other Bond films in the last 10-15 years lacked...a good script.",positive
Probably the best Bond since SC.,negative
Bond's just the right side of psycho and is finally back in the real world - which comes with proper emotional consequences. Shame about the silly comic book scar over the bad guy's eye though.,positive
"What Batman Begins did for the Batman franchise this did for Bond. Everything is faster, harder and more intense than ever and from the opening scene until the end credits I was on the edge of my seat. Daniel Craig was perfectly cast as Bond and gives more of an emotional depth to the character than it ever has. In my opinion Martin Campbell is the king of action films and as always it never lets up here, there are some truly exceptional fight scenes, chase scenes, and shootouts, also as a guy I can say that the end torture scene was exceptionally memorable. Eva Green is Bond's new love interest Vesper Lynd and I think she is perfectly cast as well she has a classic beauty to her and is incredibly vulnerable. This Bond for the new decade is what bond should have started being from the beggining and I hope that everybody keeps up the good work. I can't wait to see Quantum of Solace!! :up:",positive
"While a bit on the long side, and an unnecessarily long intro to the main plot, this is a Bond that is truly likable because he's actually a human being. The others are cardboard cut-outs. Daniel Craig rocks.",negative
Not bad! Sadly with that fucking blond Bond. A black Bond has been better.,negative
Un petit depoussierage et un lifting et ca donne l'un des meilleurs Bond de toute la serie,positive
not my favorite Bond movie.,positive
"Not the best Bond movie I've ever seen, but still had it's merit. Craig David does quite well in the roll, but it does seem that he's struggling to fill the roll of James Bond.",negative
"Don't remember it much, but my brother raves about it.",negative
I don't usually like james bonds movied but this one i liked,negative
Daniel Craig plays a good bond plus he's easy on the eyes!,negative
daniel craig is sooo sexy,positive
yon bien réussi leur rentré avec ce james bond on va voir ca s'en va ou avec le prochain,negative
"por que dicen todos que es genial, si en la mitad de la pelicula se vuelve un embole.",negative
It might be my favorite Bond ever.,positive
More than just a bondfilm...,positive
"Daniel Craig is the best James Bond in decades. this is James Bond's first 007 mission takes him to Madagascar, where he is to spy on a terrorist Mollaka. Not everything goes as planned and Bond decides to investigate, independently of the MI6 agency, in order to track down the rest of the terrorist cell. Following a lead to the Bahamas, he encounters Dimitrios and his girlfriend, Solange. He learns that Dimitrios is involved with Le Chiffre, banker to the world's terrorist organizations. also Casino Royale stars Eva Green,Giancarlo Giannini,Jeffrey Wright,Judi Dench and Mads Mikkelsen. if this is James Bond's first 007 mission then why is the first film Dr.No shouldn't it be this. this is the best James Bond movie yet and i am looking forward to Quantum of Solace coming out in 2008. a great James Bond movie from director Martin Campbell.",positive
"A reboot of the franchise, Casino Royale truly brought what was once a predictable movie series back to life with its much more gritter take.",positive
awesome movie.. loved every scene of it,positive
Darker. Grittier. This 007 doesn't make cliche jokes when he elaborately kills someone. He just drowns them in a urinal and then walks away. The best Bond-movie ever.,positive
Can't wait for Quantum of Solace!!!,positive
"Good action movie, but not a Bond movie.",negative
I didn't think he could pull of James Bond; he did pretty good.,negative
"Daniel Craig plays a brilliant Bond, and this Bond film will take some beating, a fine story, and excellent cast. The 2 hours just didn`t seem boring at all.",positive
"Daniel Craig plays a brilliant Bond, and this Bond film will take some beating, a fine story, and excellent cast. The 2 hours just didn`t seem boring at all.",positive
The best bond movie ever & I never thought you could beat Connery in my heart as top bond !,positive
"Una peli que tenÃ­a pendiente, finalmente pude verla. Un james bond distinto muy bien personificado por daniel craig . La recomiendo, ahora a esperar la 2",positive
ending was too long!!!,negative
A new standard for Bond movies!,positive
The Bond from the streets!,negative
Best Bond movie... so far,positive
Not a Bond fan...but he's a great Bond.,negative
"Bond, James Bond....is awesome as always!!!",positive
"I have to admit I loved this movie-- being a fan of Daniel Craig (Enduring Love, Munich, Layer Cake) and Mads Mikkelsen (Prague); I seem to have gone through my adolescent Bond-Sean Connery phase straight to this one, without all the intervening Bonds-- lucky me!",positive
"This is a fantastic action movie, and Daniel Craig makes a great Bond (probably the closest representation to Fleming's character in the books) but I still don't know how I feel about the new direction of the series. It seems like they are milking too much off of the Bourne series here, and I don't know how I feel about Bond being the sexual object moreso than the lead Bond Girl here. But still, I like it a lot. The whole poker sequence (baccarat anyone?) is outstanding.",positive
Awesome action......great young Bond style,positive
"Daniel Craig is really my favorite Bond. The beginning chase scene of this movie is beyond incredible, though the female interest threw me off. I had to keep checking the movie case to be sure I was watching a Bond film.",positive
Good Bonding. Not the David Niven version.,negative
The new Bond...Right on par with what it should be. Daniel Craig plays a great Badass 007.,positive
Handsdown my favorite Bond film. Daniel Craig maintains his super hotness while being brolic.,positive
Renewed my faith and love in 007. Totally rocked my world.,positive
"Laughably bad Bond-film that does not even feel like a Bond-film. Biggest problem here is that it abandons all the humour and campiness of earlier films and tries to be more serious and violent. It does not help that director Martin Cambell who has done nothing worth to mention in his whole directing career makes the whole film feel lame with his below the average directing. Daniel Graig is easily the worst Bond in the whole history of Bond-films. He just poses woodenly and fails miserably to bring any charm to his character. Same goes for equally bad Mads Mikkelsen. This is a meaningless, false and extremely pointless piece of bad film-making.",negative
Possivelmente um dos melhores da serie.,positive
first blu-ray movie i got. looks amazing but not an interesting movie.,negative
fantastic movie and Craig does a great new Bond,positive
intense none stop action more of a bourne than a bond but still amazing,positive
"While Pierce Brosnan certainly brought his own charm and personality to the character, it is Daniel Craig who truly rein",positive
didn't think he would make such a good bond but he reinvented it and made it all his own,positive
"""The best bond film ever, Daniel Craig fits very well as 007. Casino Royale is very smart, clever & thrilling to watch.""",positive
"Watching it right now, for the 100th time probably. I never get tired of this. I think this is my favorite Bond film. Not as much action or stunts as the other Bond movies, but I really liked the story. Too bad Eva Green's character died -- hottest bond girl so far!",positive
"Brilliant rebirthing of a seemingly tired series of spy films. This has to be the most realist, gritty, & toughest Bonds ever portrayed. The plot was compelling and well done with the performances. Query: Who would win a fight, Casino Royale James Bond or Jason Bourne?",positive
"Terrific. This movie has replaced Goldeneye as my favorite Bond flick of all time. It's engrossing from beginning to end, and never gets boring. Daniel Craig turns in a surprisingly amazing performance as 007 and brings a more human and beleivable quality to the character. This is a must see for both Bond fans and fans of action movies alike.",positive
Very VERY good...cant wait 4 # 2...,positive
"Martin Campbell re-invites Bond (again) after his own re-invention peters out with the underrated Die Another Day. Not just a great Bond flick, but a great action film.",positive
One of the best James Bond movies.,positive
its the best of 007 movies.,positive
First blue ray movie I ever saw!,negative
great action packed movie,positive
"This was the best Bond film to come along since The Spy Who Loved me. The series gets a great makeover & proves that you don't need all the gadgetry to do it. Also, Bond hasn't been this physical in years!",positive
What a great bond movie. Daniel Craig takes the role with ease.,positive
"It's a Bond movie, without the cheese. 'Nuff said.",positive
Not as good as Pierce but entertaining,negative
"I've seen this three times since it's come out, two times fairly recently. It's progressed in my estimation each time. Craig is a very book-loyal Bond, who is genuinely charming instead of smarmy, and genuinely scary instead of silly. Eva Green is the most beautiful Bond girl ever, and Le Chiffre is a pretty good villain. Cool fights, the only real noticeable weaknesses are a couple parts that drag after the poker game is completed.",positive
"To be perfectly honest my only real exposure to James Bond was the Pierce Brosnan movies, especially ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and ""Die Another Day"", so I was hesitant about watching this. I read some reviews and many said that it was more reminiscent of old-school Bond movies and slower-paced so that didn't help. ""Quantum of Solace"" seemed interesting and thanks to The Digital Bits, who suggested that people watch ""Casino Royale"" right before ""Quantum"" and they were absolutely right. This movie sets up ""Quantum"" directly but this was a lot more action-packed than I expected given the reviews, even more so than the Brosnan films. Craig did a great job although it made the character go from very detached to very attached but it added depth and change to the character. I really enjoyed this entry.",positive
best Bond movie in a really long time,positive
The best Bond film I've ever seen. Daniel Craig makes it far more believable than Pierce Brosnan ever did.,positive
"This is in my top 3 of Bond films. Daniel Craig is believable as a former special forces man drafted into MI6, and the quips are kept to a minimum. The end is a bit muddled but this is a far superior film to the bloated shash of Day Another Day.",positive
great action and fight scenes. the torture scene was great! it slowed down with all that poker playing but otherwise it i really enjoyed it.,negative
I'm not really a fan of Bond movies but it was good.,negative
Best Bond film of all time. Period.,positive
best bond since sean connery,positive
"The Best Bond Movie Made In The Last 10 Years !! Really Sets Bond Into A Darker, More Realistic Storyline.",positive
Bond is back...and apparently blonde.,positive
what a badass. he IS Bond.,negative
"nice renewal of the James Bond movies, Daniel Craig is convincing",positive
"Last person to see this, but it was awesome!!",positive
This is my favorite Bond film. :),positive
"I expected James Bond to have more finesse. Daniel Craig did nothing for me. Overall, not bad -comparable to Mission Impossible.",negative
Best Bond Made! And the Best Actor to Portrai Bond EVER!,positive
One the best Bond films yet. And what about that Aston Martin!,positive
Best James Bond movie yet.,positive
Superb! The best Bond film in a very long time!,positive
Looses half a star for all the multiple endings apart from that love it.,positive
Daniel Craig Ã¤r den bÃ¤sta 007 hittills!,positive
"Daniel Craig has been given a lot of hassle over his casting as Bond (like Clive Owen, Jude Law or Orlando Bloom WOULDN'T have been a big mistake?) he's in a lot better shape, has the intensity Brosnan lacked and is surprisingly loose in a role that usually requires actors to be stiff and unemotional. It's also good to see a fresh face in the role and who cares if he is blonde? Or the shortest actor to play him so far?",positive
'Casino Royale' is about as entertaining as a shallow action movie can be.,negative
Hands down. Best Bond movie ever.,positive
not funny like the original,negative
"Excellent, refreshing and everything you'd want from a Bond movie.",positive
"It was a new Bond. It wasn't the best, cause the storyline became a little bit confusing to the end, but maybe someone wants to enlight me about it. I didn't get it finally. But it was a good Bond movie and more realistic (as a Bond could be realistic ;-)) than other Bond movies before.",negative
best bond movie I've seen,positive
This is by far the best Bond movie to me. Daniel Craig did a great job! It's got great action and story. Simply my favorite Bond movie. Can't wait to see the Quantum of Solace.,positive
Easily the best Bond film out there.,positive
"a grittier, stripped down bond. the last half is amazing.",positive
"""Casino Royale"" is a different take on the 007 saga but is nonetheless really awesome! The only reason it doesn't get a perfect score from me is due to the fact that the first 30 to 40 minutes of the movie dragged on a little bit. Having just watched this, I can't wait to see the sequel ""Quantum of Solace""!",positive
"Finally, a Bond we can LOVE. Daniel Craig has reinvented a well-established franchise with great subtlety and style. Casting made a very wise choice. This is also the best Bond film ever...so far! Can't wait for the next one and hopefully several more to follow.",positive
The greatest james bond film ever made. It also features the greatest foot chase ever filmed.,positive
This is the best of almost all the Bond films. I look forward to Quantum coming soon.,positive
"Like the character, the movie packs action with style. There is no dearth of eye-pleasure in the movie - whether it be the heart-stopping stunts or the gorgeous locales or the dapper presence of Bond himself. The movie is a thrill from start to finish. If not the masterful fight sequence atop a crane, the director keeps the audience on the edge with the suspenseful drama of the poker game. There are plenty of fistfights and hand-to-hand combats, all choreographed brilliantly, for the action aficionados. Alongside runs the tensed theme of conspiracies and duplicity, and you just wait in anticipation for the proverbial stab-in-the-back to happen anytime. Combine that with the sharp cinematography and slick editing, and you have a really engrossing fare. Any Bond movie relies ultimately on the charisma and magnetism of Bond himself. The movie will clearly be lesser if not for Daniel Craig. He brings the sexy back to the Bond movies -- his simmering intensity, that dry wit, the arrogance -- and combine that with deadly charm. Of course, this movie displays a softer side and steers away from the usual playboy Bond. It helps that the chemistry between him and Eva Green was believable enough. As gorgeous as she was, we understood that it was her ability to stand up to him and her innocence inside that attracted Bond. Eva Green does a decent enough job, although unconventional, as the Bond girl, as she had to be less sultry and more... human in her character.",negative
Great film. Hop QOS will be as good.,positive
"this is hands down the best bond in a long time and i love all bond movies. Daniel Craig makes for a far more brutal Bond and you actually believe that this guy would be efficiant at using his liscence to kill. The action is top notch, especially the free running scene. And Eva Green is excellent as Vespa and will go down as one of the top bond girls. I just hope hope the Quantum of solace lives up to the promise of this one.",positive
Daniel Craig is a good Bond!,positive
James Bond turns nasty. That's nasty with a capital N!,positive
I had my doubts.. but finally Bond was Bond!,positive
"Awesome film, Great acting, Great action, Magnificent rebirth for the franchise.",positive
"Superb twist on the franchise .. from the gritty opening sequences x 2 that make certain we know this is not your Dad's Bond, thru the most captivating bond girl performance since Jane Seymour, to the rollercoaster finale .. excellent stuff!",positive
The new bond. Ohh..... Ian would be happy.,positive
i do not like the new direction. i miss all the gadgets,negative
Daniel Craig is the man. cant wait to see the prequel.,positive
"I can't believe I'm giving this movie 5 stars, when I thought that Daniel Craig was going to tank as Bond. Now I can't wait till Quantum and many more with Craig as 007!",positive
his film is very good . i loved daniel person and eva was very cute and very good,positive
"Best Bond movie ever. Too long, though.",positive
"seen at least 10 times, still fab",positive
"Excellent new take on the bond franchise. I am a massive bond fan, got all the films etc - and was dreading this new film as I just couldn't see how Daniel Craig could make it work - especially being so monumentally different in every respect to Pierce Brosnan. But After first seeing the film not only was I blown away, but realised that Brosnan was the ""old guard"" - should've taken some warning from the at times ridiculous Die Another Day (invisible car anyone?!?) It wasn't until I saw this film that I realised that we needed a new Bond - but I also realised that we (especially after the Bourne Trilogy) needed a fresh, honest approach - no gadgets, dodgy castings, no outlandish plot, ridiculous villains....and this is why Casino Royale delivers it is a back to basics Bond.....Plot....character...action. Plenty of familiar staples are there beautiful women, locations and cars are all there, but all placed in symetry with a more realistic modern...even slightly cynical take on the world. Daniel Craig deserves credit above all else - I had seen him in Layer Cake etc, and was dreading his appearance in the franchise...but I could not have been more wrong... he has clearly silenced the majority of his critics - he is absolutely excellent, he succeeds in bringing a more ""fleming"" Bond back to the screen - following where Timothy Dalton last tried - but slightly failed due to his lack of overall presence. He really puts life and conviction into the character - he is a licensced Killer, he is flawed, does make mistakes but is relentlessly dedicated to the job in hand. When you see his eyes, Craig really looks like he is enjoying himself which makes you buy into the film even more. A confident and excellent return to form.",positive
"The worst James Bond ever! I like Daniel Craig, I like James Bond. This is not a James Bond, this is a bad action movie with lots of explosion and no scenario. Where are the gadgets? Where is James the gentleman? Where is the plot?",negative
What can I say? I'm a sucker for James Bond!,positive
Breathing life back into a franchise that had started to go down the pipes. This movie just kicks ass. Best bond since Connery. Makes you proud to be a fan of 007.,positive
I'm glad this was the first 007 I ever saw. So much better than that overrated Bourne bullshit.,positive
"personally the best Bond i've seen... a real Bond with the blonde hair and all. Great action, story and ofcourse Daniel Craig... oh and the Aston Martin DBS!!! brilliant!!",positive
"Best Bond movie, with best bond since connery!",positive
"trÃ¨s bon film, j'adore James Bond :D",positive
If every Bond movie keeps this kind of pace of excitement danger and actually being able to keep up with the story the first time while feeling somehow linked to bond; we're in for a new age of bond movies. It'll keep us on our toes and the edge of our seats!! Too bad you can't give more than 5 stars!,positive
The worst bond I've ever seen,negative
closest to Ian Flemings books,positive
"I was reluctant to ever see a bond movie, but this was actually very good. Lots of action, and a more realistic bond.",positive
I was expecting a spit in the face of the bond legacy. But this looks a lot more like a bond movie than die another day. Offcorse there are things that didn't make me so happy...but overall it was pretty good. craig should have brown hair though,positive
Daniel Craig made a hot James Bond.,positive
"Not normally a bond fan, but this film was a good watch",negative
Con GoldeNeye Martin Campbell logra llevar a Bond a su maximo,positive
"I must admit that I was a bit worried when they decided to 're-launch' the bond movies by going back to the original books, however, this is a great movie. Free from the formulaic set of recent Bond movies, this is still Bond, cool, tough, charming, action-packed but it's free from the shackles of what Bond had become. No longer predictable or the super-human (but almost) Bond, this one has flaws and weaknesses. Also gives a nod to the other Bond movies with the appearance of the DB5 and the customary villain-with-a-scar. Great stuff.",positive
le meilleur james bond ! vivement quantum of solace,positive
Ah...seeing Daniel Craig shirtless never gets old!!!,positive
"It was a little more violent than I expected, and I was confused by the opening frame for the story - it's not quite like the book. Nevertheless, I loved Daniel Craig as Bond. Wasn't as crazy about Eva Green as Vesper, tho - she didn't look as sophisticated as I've always imagined this character. Now I'm putting the 1967 version onto my Netflix queue...",positive
great as the new Bond,positive
Extremely disappointed.,negative
"Best Bond film ever! Back to basics with a modern twist. Breathtaking action scenes and a good plot. Violence was realistic but not overdone. Who needs a villain who wants to conquer or destroy the world, when all you need is just the simple motive of money. And Bond's handy enough to manage without Q's gadgets! (Ok there was the defibrillator in the car but it wasn't overdoing it) And oh plus one star for the fact that NO-ONE said ""Vodka martini, shaken not stirred"" once. And did I mention how absolutely Hot Daniel Craig is? Plus something for that too, and for once the leading women in this film were more than just boobs and asses to look at. I actually quite liked Eva Green and Judi Dench's performances. And a final plus one (that makes 8 stars altogether =)) for the amazing theme song!",positive
"Some cool scenes, but way too long",negative
"I was never a Bond fan...like at all. But after watching this movie, I am a true fan of the new Bond Daniel Craig. He kicked ass as Bond and the movie itself kicked ass with breathtaking stunts, awesome cars, and beautiful women. What more can you ask for? I definitely look forward to the new Bond film, Quantum of Solace. This is how Bond should be portrayed, not all cheesy with unrealistic weaponry and ice caves. Come on! Although Halle Berry was quite a treat to look at.",positive
Focus on the eyes when D Craig is talking or the camera is on him...that alone shows that this is not a usual bond movie but a one which has a man who also thinks wat he does...,positive
"Yes, this is lushly mounted, and expertly staged, but thats not the point. The key thing that makes Casino Royale work, I think, is that it is genuinely suspenseful. You really have a hard time guessing whats coming next. The thrills are not mere thrills here; every action sequence is first preceded by an introspective moment that heightens the tension. This is emphasized by the Hitchcock-style twists at the end. These new movies have also been taking their subject matter very seriously. We do have girls, stunts and humor, but its not a self-aware package like 'Goldeneye'. The tone now is ""realism"".",positive
"Not the best Bond movie I watched. The action sequences are outstanding, specially the man hunt chase at the start. It gets bored towards the end though.",negative
"Not only does this feature one of the most spectacular action sequences of the decade, it is an even better character study. Not only do his physical actions define him but the absolutely sharp sparring with Vesper show his true character. The thing is that Craig and Green actually have chemistry, you feel that there is a mutual fondness without them speaking a word. Craig is perfectly suave and believably brutal; while Green is feisty and reserved just as well. In many ways they are the same person but how each of them learn to deal with their cold hearts is one of Casino's best qualities. Though the plot becomes busy the focus on Bond is never lost. Actually, rewatching the film helped to illuminate character nuances outside of Bond. I otherwise missed these pieces the first time around due to the tight plot and intense character focus. But that is necessary because by the time Bond becomes closer to the familiar Bond from past films, it feels earned. Even as a stand alone film, you rarely see a character study like this.",positive
"rien à voir avec James bond pour moi, l'intrigue n'est faite que de SMS trouvés...",negative
"Craig as Bond was perfect! He portraited a ruthless and realistic Bond similar to the book. After watching Layercake, it makes perfect sense why he is the new 007.",positive
"A great re-boot to the Bond franchise. Apart from the handling of the violence, it really is just another Bond film... so it's great fun. Action packed, filled with sexy babes and excitement. Bring on the next one.",positive
Definitly up there with all the Sean Connery 007s Action packed right to the very end,positive
"This is a GREAT reboot to the Bond series, breathing new life into the series. The film has so much great style about it, great acting and a storyline that really is witty and grand! Eva Green and Daniel Craig really are amazing in this film. Great Bond film! Another one of the Best Bond's!",positive
Although I adore Sean Connery - Daniel Craig is magnetic and able!,positive
Better than expected. But Roger Moore is still the best Bond.,negative
"I saw Daniel Craig first in Layer Cake and I knew he would make a good James Bond. When he beats someone up on screen I can actually believe it, unlike Pierce Brosnan.",positive
Great reboot of the series! I've seen all the James Bond movies and I love this one the most! can't wait for Quantom of Solace,positive
"A very interesting portrayal of the beginnings of Bond. Gritty and compelling performance by Daniel Craig. For fans of high stakes poker especially. Less action than its predecessors, but still Bond in the true sense of the word.",positive
"I miss Pierce!!!! This guy does alright, but I like Pierce!!!!",negative
It's a Bond film. It has to be good. Even if he's a blonde Bond. It's still brilliant!,positive
The best James Bond film ever made. I can't wait until Quantum of Solace come to theaters on Nov. 14.,positive
I never thought these words would come out of my mouth but I like Pierce Brosnan way more than this guy.,negative
I gave it 3 1/2 stars just because it's James Bond... I wasn't happy with the choices for actors in the movie... The plot was alright... It left a bit to be desired...,negative
"Got the Bond feeling, the brittsh charm and the gadgets :D",negative
"Loved it, would watch again.",positive
"Daniel Craig not so good as James ""007"" Bond.",negative
"he's no connery, but for some reason I don't really care. Awesome bond movie",positive
Je ne suis pas dÃ©Ã§u par ce nouvel Ã©pisode ; bon film d'action.,positive
"I was unsure at first about a blond Bond. But Daniel Craig has my vote of confidence. He's the only bond to actually do some of his own stunts, he's ruggedly good looking more of a connery than the squeaky clean Brosnan and Moore and he brings a steely indifference to the character which i like. Judy Dench returns as 'M' in this film which goes right back to the beginning, the making of 007.",positive
"Such a blast to watch! The best bond film since The Man with a Golden Gun, Daniel Craig is one of the greatest bonds of all time. Lets hope that the second installment is even better.",positive
"I love James Bond movies, but this really didn't feel like a Bond movie at all. It was still good and has a lot of action. I guess I just need to get used to Daniel Craig as James Bond. He doesn't have a huge British accent like Bonds from the past have had.",negative
"Good acting, the film didn't quite propel itself towards excellent though.",negative
Daniel Craig was made to play James Bond. This movie is absolutely amazing. Easily the best Bond film so far. The only way this will be dethroned is when Quantam of Solace comes out this year.,positive
"Bond drives Ford Mondeo, WTF?",negative
"Let me just say ""Blond Bond-Shell""",positive
THAT's my James bond right there,positive
I was surprised by how good this was. One of the best Bonds around. And I'm pretty tired of them.,positive
"Now that the girls are back in school, I have time to watch TV. So this movie was on HBO and I loved it. Story was interesting about Bond's early days. It was unreal how he was being tortured by Le Chiffre. Whothe heck even though of that??? Overall I really liked the movie and thought that Daniel Craig did a really good job of being a tough agent, not the smooth, pretty-boy operator that Roger Moore was as 007. Plus Daniel Craig was HOT! Had to rewind a couple of times. :)",positive
I didn't think I would like Daniel Craig in this role but he pulled it off quite well.,negative
Best. Bond. Film. EVER.,positive
Not THY BEST JAMES BOND MOVIE EVA,positive
"Le renouveau que tout le monde attendait, le voila! Un nouvel acteur (genial) et un nouveau 007. Plus dur, plus violent et surtout moins surfait et pretentieux (le precedent frolait le ridicule avec la course aux gadgets et le super mechant robocop...) Qu'on regrette Pierce ou qu'on acclame Craig en sauveur, on ne peut nier la qualitÃ© de ce dernier episode de James Bond.",positive
that heroin looked like a duck sometimes but sometimes she is like the angel descend from heaven oh god lol btw did daniel craig really got smacked in the balls ?? i think that just scracthes it well an exotic scracth probably with a rope with a knot of the size of ma heed,positive
"Believe it or not, this was my first time with James Bond - to see a James Bond movie I should say! And it was absolutely amazing - non-stop action and a very gorgeous Daniel Craig!! Ooo la la!!!!",positive
Not as impressive as I'd hoped. Very predictable and slow at times. I hoped it would've been a better plot.,negative
Sexiest Bond ever....,positive
Best Bond movie of them all,positive
"""Daniel Craig redefines James Bond for eons to come."" ""The name's Bond. James Bond."" These are the words spoken by Bond himself that have helped to make him famous and who he is. Have we all secretely, not even ourselves knowing whether a new Bond will come along and redefine not only those words but the character of Bond as a whole? Whether or not we have secretely wondered this, the time has come. Despite being a reboot and completely starting over, Casino Royale retains all the good aspects of the original films and more. The clunky gadgets have been stripped away, leaving more room for the simple and traditional firearms. Bond also has a style of unpredictability, making you constantly wonder what he will do next. The use of casino poker being so well played into the plot, along with lots of business transaction, gives the film a sort of financial and gambling feel, such as when someone is beaten at a game of proffesional poker, some feel they were cheated or desperately need the money, causing them to do whatever it takes to claim what they want. This is a well played point in the film that sets in motion a series of chain events that leads up to the unforgettable climax. On the performance side, Daniel Craig does an outstanding job. He may not carry the all the characteristics of the original Bonds but he most certainly lives above all other Bonds except Sean Connery. His dark but sometimes happy nature is a welcome addition to the franchise and hopefully, Craig will be the most memorable Bond in the new saga. Eva Green is probably the best Bond girl ever in her role as Vesper Lynd. She is one of the girls who at first rejects Bond rather than warming up to him so easily. She has different qualities than previous Bong girls,many of which we can't tell what they are but are there nontheless. Judi Dench is also well suited for her role as M. She is gruff and strict but compassionate and has a sense of authority that you know you don't want to ignore. She also seems on friendly but tense terms with Bond, due to the fact he simply takes the assingnments than proceeds in his own way rather than the way M assigns him. Despite all the great qualities this film has, it also has its faults. On the first point, Bond is still quite the ladies man. He claims that single is his type, making him a bit of a womanizer. And just like previous films, the cartoony and musical intro is still there, which somewhat discourages the viewer. Even in the reboot, the cartoony intros still haven't disappeared. Overall, the film is great. You can watch this film with the same enjoyment experienced while watching the Sean Connery films. And how could you possibly beat that? This film is a perfect beginning seen after an epic end.",positive
"Finally, the franchise wised up and returned to the series' roots, when Connery's Bond was a rough-and-tumble thug-in-a-tux. Gadgets have been scaled back considerably and the heroine given a brain, and the casting of Craig brings gravitas and acting skill to the role. There are still ""oh come on"" moments that stretch the limits of taste and credibility, and the card scene in the movie's midsection could have lost 10 minutes, but this was a welcome reboot to a legacy that had grown tired and irrelevant.",positive
"A movie with a fantastic storyline, amazing actors, brilliant action and gives us the best Bond ever. I would definetly say that this is the best Bond film.",positive
"OK. C??mon folks, this movie shat big time. I may end up liking Craig as Bond but this was just another action movie combined with as many witty product shots as they and their sponsors could make possible. The Bond character has been around too long for me to believe when he was rookie 00 agent in a post-9/11 world where Photoshop and text messaging exist. I like the ?rogue agent? angle but again I think it?s too late for such an extreme version of Bond that we never saw hinted at in previous incarnations and quite honestly this new version is about as ?smooth and suave? as Jay & Silent Bob. All in all I feel this film fell victim to such other ?flop sequels? along the lines of ?Live Free or Die Hard? that has little feel of the rest of the franchise save for they slapped the franchises character name into a lame everyday script and juiced it up with special effects?.",negative
"WOW! This is definitely the best Bond film in a long time. I love the more hand to hand combat aspect of the movie. It really allows you to get into the movie. This movie was also hard to predict. Much more entertaining that way. The stunts were awesome, especially the crane scene in the beginning of the movie. Also how the plot turns so drastically, really keeps the excitement built. I can not wait for Quantum of Solace after seeing this movie. Bond is back!",positive
"Rorschach Journal Entry: September 1st, 2008 Watched latest Bond movie. Pretty good. I'd say Daniel Craig does about as good as Connery did. Lot of explosions. Lot of action. Recommend it? Why not. Would I pay to see it again? Sure. 9.5/10",positive
Loved it. Boo to the naysayers who didn't think Craig could it. Bring on the next,positive
C-. Might as well watch World Poker Tour. Craig is good,negative
One of the best Bond movies. Incredible action and wonderful quality all around. Can't wait for the next one!,positive
Excellent. Going back to Ian Fleming's original books was a great idea. Great story and great action.,positive
For all the gripping about Craig as Bond I think that he's simply the best since Connery. I actually think that this is the best Bond picture as it is more plot driven with a real plot not filled with gadgets galore and inane plot devices. I absolutely loved Eva Green as Vesper and Daniel Kleinman's credit sequence became one of my all time favorites for both Bond films and movies in general.,positive
"pretty awesome, and long.",negative
"Faut faire gaffe, quand tu joues au poker avec James Bond, il te pique ton fric, ta voiture et ta meuf, et avec classe en plus. Eva Green: rrrraaaaarrrggglllaaaayaaa (pardon)",positive
Efficace. Daniel Craig incarne a merveille ce Bond violent et venere.,negative
"Started out as a good movie, the ending dragged out.",negative
"Aside from the fact that the poker scene was a little long, this movie is awesome!",positive
so i finally got to see it. i actually enjoyed it. it seems the movies about the beginnings seem to always be the better ones. so since i am not a huge james bond fan at all because i think that all the movies were always the same and not much to look forward to this one definitely was different. good amount of action explains a lot about the character good development of the character. witty dialogue and intelligent dialogue at that.now i can go see quantum of solace tomorrow so excited.:) anyways great film.,negative
"I haven't seen any other Bond movie, so I've got nothing to compare it to in that respect, but I thought it was pretty good.",negative
NÃ¥r Daniel Craig endelig beslutter sig for at sparke rÃ¸v gÃ¸r han det ogsÃ¥ med stil,positive
It is a great movie but not really a bond movie,negative
"My favorite James Bond movie apart from Golden Eye, and the Conory films. + Eva Green, more realistic, and a more serious take on James Bond",positive
love this film and i like him lol good if u like action,positive
Volim gledat James Bonda a ovaj film mi je bas super... Gledala sam ga i prije i bilo mi je osvjezenje pogledat ga opet,positive
"Nice relaunch, and Craig is great. Thank you, Jason Bourne.",negative
"A very good film, not the best one ever, but still an enjoyable, action- filled movie with a nice plot. Dainel Craig did a good job portraying the new james bond, but still not as good as Sean Connery. This movie may be a little bit too overrated, but still very enjoyable.",positive
"I must admit, i was almost put off due to Craig getting the role, but was quite surprised at how he pulls off the new-look Bond. No fancy gadgets, no corny one-liners, no invisible cars, and guess what? It works. From the opening high-octane chase involving Bond and a daredevil bomb-maker to the wince-some torture scene, Craig delivers a darker pitbull-like 007 that makes former Bonds like Brosnan, Moore and Connery look like french poodles. Apart from a ludicrous defribilator scene and Chris Cornell's patchy theme-song, Bond is back with a vengeance. Roll on the Quantum of Solace.",positive
"simply put, the best bond, even better than goldfinger... and my favorite movie of 2006.",positive
"I really miss the style and class of Pierce Brosnan, but nevertheless an alright movie. Bit too much rampage for a James Bond movie in my opinion.",negative
gr8 movie.. buh i still prefer pierce..,positive
*This* is James Bond. Hummina.,positive
"This movie is great! I loved the tone the movie had; Bond actually seemed more like a real person but with the same great action and wit. I loved Goldeneye but honestly the formula of Bond after that: how can we make the car crazier, insert token Bond girl (Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist?!), and really cheesy humor was getting old. This is the reboot the franchise needed.",positive
"Still nice to see the Mr. Bond movie, maybe this one is better than the last Mr. Bond, I like it...",positive
Awesome! Daniel Craig is a badass Bond,positive
Fantastic! Everyone should invest in it. NOW!,positive
couldn't accept Daniel Craig as a replacement for Pierce Brosnan but yeah the movie is fantastic with it's secrets and twisting suspense... two thumbs up...:-),positive
"Daniel Craig as James Bond, he's pretty damn good. But lacks that bond charm that the other Bonds had. He's cold and serious, i can see why they call him a ""Jason Bourne"" Casino Royale is a pretty damn good bond movie. For a starter up, its awesome. Long action scenes, a good story, and a good good damn Bond movie.",positive
I can't wait for Quantum of Solace!,positive
"i've never enjoyed a bond film until now, although the third third dragged. i think 007's been waiting a long time for Mr Craig",negative
"CONSENSUS: An unforeseen tour de force in the Bond franchise, which had been sluggishly crawling along with poor episodes such as DIE ANOTHER DAY. A refreshing return to the intense espionage found in 007 classics FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and DR. NO, this establishes Bond as a cold-blooded, yet emotional being. Craig is the best actor to play 007 since Connery, bringing back the much needed edge to the character. Greene is elegant and mysterious as Vesper and the rest of the supporting cast is superb. Has an intriguing plot line that is executed well and leaves us craving for the sequel QUANTUM OF SOLACE. The best Bond movie since GOLDFINGER and one of the best films of 2006. MY GRADE: A",positive
I could have been happy without the first 20 min. of this. The story and the scenery were absorbing until the improbable last 20 min. Isn't James Bond as a character a bit passe? Way too long at 2 hr. 25 min.,negative
daniel craig is just so sexy!! hot hot hot!,positive
I knew he'd be an awesome bond..I told everyone but no one believed me..the movie was good..despite the draggin love scenes...*barf*,positive
Daniel Craig is James Bond. I even think he has bested Connery (classic Bond).,positive
"Daniel Craig, Eva Green",positive
Bond as he was meant to be,positive
Superb. Almost perfect. A proper Bond at last. Just hope it continues like that and drops all the stupid 1 liners and the gadgets.,positive
"James Bond has never been better than this. I think the franchise reboot was a good idea. This is non stop from start to finish, with some incredible sequences. Without all the silly gadgets, Bond has become more of a realistic character rather than the cartoon like affair from previous movies. Let's hope the follow up maintains the high standards set here.",positive
the first blonde bond. craig made all the action scenes believable.,positive
"My second viewing of this film offered me more than the first. This is one of the best films made in the last 5 years. Nothing is lacking here: story, cast, action, Bond prestige, women, dialogue, and intelligence all deliver... constantly. Bond is bigger, better, faster, and smarter than ever, no question. To make an action film smart and suspenseful? Clever. To reinvent the Bond series without betraying its foundation? Simply genius.",positive
Slightly gritty Bond movie. Beautiful women,negative
"Gotta give it to the new guy for finally showing up connery, and for being the first blond bond.",positive

"Awesome plot and great character development, making this by far, my favorite Bond movie.",positive
very good movie...action was great..and moreover it was daniel craig as 007 that made this movie even more great...even though this movie didnt have fancy gadgets like other bond movies it still makes this one as good or even better than the others!,positive
"This was really really good.Great story some pretty eh hem brutal parts,and some beautiful scenery from some of the places they shot this.I recommend this for sure!",positive
007 movies finally catch up with the 21st century. Brilliant.,positive
Bond in Blu-Ray rocks!,positive
Actor's not good though,negative
"Casino Royale Is My Favourite James Bond Film. Daniel Craig Is Brilliant In This, One Of His Best Films. I'd Reckonmend It To My Friends.",positive
Released during the remake the series fad in Hollywood and thank goodness. I'm not saying Pierce Brosnan was a bad era for James Bond but some of the stuff was getting out of hand and completely ridiculous. Daniel Craig portrays Bond as a grittier cold assassin and it suits the time period they seem to be salvaging the Bond series from. Best Bond since Sean Connery in my opinion.,positive
"eh... it was good... Action was cool, Eva Green is pretty, I like poker. I really really liked the graphics work in the opening credit sequence.",negative
"Awesome chware teg, cyfnod bach sopi jyst cyn diwedd ond ffab. edrych mlaen i'r un nesa.",positive
"bond is pretty cocky, but this movie was pretty good. the first chase action scene was kind of unbelievable.",negative
"The first 007 movie I have ever seen! I didn't like the previous actors but Dainel Craig has managed to be a new, fresh, rough James Bond. And the plot is thrilling! I learned Texas Hold'em thanks to it! :P",positive
"Looks like Daniel Craig fits in after all, with a new rougher exterior, Craig delivers 007 with a little more umph in the action scenes. Just check out the the 1st chase with the bombdealer and u'll see what i mean. As usual, crazy stunts & gadgets. Film is abit on the long side, but that's ok since it's used to flesh out Bond's character on his 1st mission as agent 007.",positive
"My favorite Bond movie...granted, I haven't watched that many...but still.",positive
I loved this movie. I did have my doubts when he was cast as the new Bond but I am glad that he is. He was GREAT!!!,positive
"one of my all time favorite movies, a great story-deep and involving- with a dab of action, and its still keeps that classy James Bond feel i love about the series. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery imo",positive
"Rather confusing plot, the action and suspense is there, and a nice twist at the end.. however, slightly long and draged out between action scenes...",positive
I found this quite entertaining:),negative
I loved this more than any other Bond movie mainly because it had a much deeper plot than any others have had. Craig helps tell the tragic tale of becoming Bond that much better.,positive
"Just seen it for the first time and it was very disappointing. The plot was very confusing and there was hardly any action for a Bond film. I would say it was one of the worse and it was so critically acclaimed as well, but then so was A Clockwork Orange.",negative
Daniel Craig does a great job as Bond. I love how we see Bond at his first mission. It provides a raw vision of Bond which fits with the plot. Too long for a Bond film though. It could have been shorter.,positive
Better than I excepted.,positive
the best james bond film ever made,positive
"Can we say gritty? And violent? And a step up? The coiffed Moores and Bronsans of the past are unrealistic and bland, making this a surprise. Daniel Craig does a fantastic job in playing the flawed hero. Eva Green is admittedly nothing more than eye candy, but it's eye candy that moves the plot along. Mikkelsen is honestly nothing better than the other Bond villians. He was the only thing that kept me from rating it a five-star movie.",positive
Worst thing ever! James Bond isn't supposed to have a potbelly!!,negative
"Easily the best James Bond, from the opening chase scene to the devastating death of his girlfriend. All time classic.",positive
"I had reservations about Daniel Craig replacing the perfect Pierce Brosnan as 007. He turned out to be an very capable actor. Combined with an gritty and well written script, the rebooted 007 franchise is off to a good start. I do miss Q.",negative
Great Movie can't wait for the sequel,positive
"Having watched this a second time, I'm now convinced that it's the best James Bond movie ever. It's certainly one of the most faithful to the books, albeit with a lot of updating. The influence of the Jason Bourne movies on Casino Royale is obvious from the parkour scene onwards, as Bond's fighting skills are suddenly faster and more lethal than they ever have been. Daniel Craig certainly embodies the nasty spirit of the original Ian Fleming Bond better than any other actor, including Sean Connery -- Bond is a cold, dispassionate killing machine, the sort of agent Jason Bourne would probably have to kill if they met up. The movie is a bit overlong, but that's been a hallmark of Bond movies for decades.",positive
"Better than probably most of the other bond movies before it, which had too much senseless action and gadgetry. This Bond is real, tough and cold.",positive
Best bond in a long time,positive
"A mix between Mission Impossible and James Bond styles of film-making. Except, there are no flesh masks in this film. Great movie.",positive
gud one.....although i don't fancy a blonde bond...but a worth watching movie.....,positive
"A refreshing change to the series, with a contemporary look and feel, and a return to the brutal no-nonsense side of espionage. The script is close enough in spirit to the book that it surpasses all previous efforts, and the wow-factor is thankfully light on gadgetry and more on risk and realism in the action scenes (especially the opening Parkour/free-running sequence). Craig is surprisingly effective in the lead role, and Green is a perfect foil - beautiful but gutsy. Mikkselsen is demonically charming, but his bleeding eye becomes an annoyance - it puts him undeservedly into the category of Deformed Villain. Also making a surprise return: Wright as a black Leiter, a concept previously only ever seen in the forgettable ""Never Say Never Again"". I was also mildly disappointed that the card game was poker instead of baccarat - it smacked of dumbing-down for audiences.",positive
"nothing but a casino game with hour breaks in between to investigate some more. Drudgingly boring, dragging, and a semi exciting ending",negative
"Bond is back!! And quite possibly better than ever? Much more character driven than the over gadgeted, set piece driven recent efforts.",positive
The only bond movie I've ever seen and it was very good.,positive
So gritty and intense! The best Bond I've seen yet.,positive
"not a bad attempt at a reboot, but still badly paced. you know, i've never really liked bond movies. jason bourne could kick bond's ass.",negative
The best Bond movie since Sean Connery. Seriously. Must see for all James Bond fans.,positive
"I saw this three times, and then I decided to buy it. I was a fan of the 007 series growing up, and I had a library of videos, but with this film, you don't have to be a James Bond fan to enjoy it. They go back to his roots (a la Batman Begins) and the result is a story-driven thrillride that will leave you wanting more, and looking forward to Quantum of Solace. Casino Royale also boasts a classic sounding score headlined by Chris Cornell with ""You Know My Name"" that fits as well as Daniel Craig and Dame Judy Densch do in their respective roles. Le Chiffre is the villain, and initiates a torture sequence that NO MAN will soon forget. See this film, as you won't regret it.",negative
"A new exciting Bond, and it takes the series in a fun new direction. One of the best Bond movies ever.",positive
yksinkertasesti vaan ihan Ã¤lyttÃ¶mÃ¤n tylsÃ¤.,negative
"Oh man, James Bond is badass again. Right from the start, you knew it was going to be something special.",positive
"I am a fan of the James Bond movies with the originals Sean Connery and Roger Moore. And I can still say that this is the best 007 film to hit the screen. Daniel Craig makes a frightening, yet extremely likable Bond with piercing blue eyes and a intense passion that is so enticing you fight the necessity to blink.",positive
Gorgeous. Everything Bond needed to be after those awful Brosnan movies.,positive
My favourite bond movie all them all. at first I was not a fan of Mr Craig - but I think he is only second to Mr Connery as a Bond.,positive
Daniel Craig is pas mal du tout....hummmm,positive
"Now that's a James Bond I can drool over. Arguably, the best James Bond movie.",positive
Daniel Craig is freakin' GORGEOUS,positive
"A witty well shot story lead to a fun, entertaining, and exciting movie. One of the better Bond movies they've released in years.",positive
It is my firm opinion that Daniel Craig is better than all the other Bonds put together.,positive
Love the new Bond-Daniel Craig,positive
"007. :]] Oh yeah, rofl.",negative
Best Bond film so far.,positive
"The best 007 movie too date, none stop action.",positive
schweet. he is one smooth talking bond. a must see,positive
was made to see this.. too long. but humorous and clever,negative
Super sweet. Reconciled what was lost by Die Another Day.,positive
This one is one serious m******,negative
"THE only bondmovie i have ever seen, not too bad",negative
"Violent, brooding, and complex. James Bond is reborn as Daniel Craig easily dominates the role, and Judi Dench is wonderful as always.",positive
"Great reboot into the 007 franchise. He's no Pierce, but he did great for what it's worth. Action was intense, the script was good, the acting was great. Definitely something everyone should watch. Loved it.",positive
mmmm Speedo lol haha :-),positive
Watching this movie was completly waste of my time. I didnt like it at all. It looks like that this is the right time for Mr. 007 to retire.,negative
"entertaining, but nothing new",negative
My new favorite James Bond,positive
Great!!! Can't wait for the next one!,positive
Bond is finally gritty...,positive
I may have a man crush on Daniel Craig as well.,positive
Best Bond Movie ever. Daniel Craig did a spectacular job.,positive
"I was extremely skeptical about Craig as the new Bond but he won me over. He's a man's Bond the way Brosnan was a real woman's Bond, not sure how that reflects on me.",positive
"Watched this a few times now and I seem to enjoy it more each time. Daniel Craig gives bond a darker more menacing feel, closer to how Fleming saw his spy.",positive
"HÃ¥rd, brutal och skoningslÃ¶s Bondfilm som gav serien en rejÃ¤l nytÃ¤ndning. Nu har man helt plÃ¶tsligt svÃ¥rt att tÃ¤nka sig en mÃ¶rkhÃ¥rig 007!",positive
I loved the new (old) Bond!,positive
best one yet. i love the new bond forever.,positive
Daniel Craig is hot and that is the main reason to see this movie. Oh yeah... and there's some good chase scenes.,negative
I want that Aston Martin.,positive
"Like Daniel Craig's gritty portrayal of James Bond, was slightly turned-off by the melodrama towards the end, though.",negative
"So damn good. Gritty, physical and intense, a very daring and totally successful reinvention of the Bond franchise for the new millennium. By far my favorite Bond of all time. (And yes, I've seen the classics.)",positive
"Overall very enjoyable out of all the bond flicks. Daniel Craig is a tough contender as best bond, I think that both him and Pierce Brosnan would be tied for best or maybe even Connery. Eva Green suprisingly enough made a great Bond Girl. Great Movie.",positive
"'Bond Begins' What a great movie,adapt from Flemming's first Bond adventure. Staring Craig as the best Bond in decades. You really believe for the first time since Connery,that this Bond will kill you,he really kicks arse. Im SO looking forward to Quantum Of Solace.",positive
"Enjoyed this film thoroughly. While missing a few bits and pieces that traditional Bond films shold have, it still remained fairly true. The only issue I had was in terms of it slotting in with the other films historically. It doesn't quite work, so the Bond purists may have an (understandable) issue - but I enjoyed it.",negative
I can't believe it has taken me this long to see this. I finally made myself watch it while recovering from surgery and I have to admit that it is awesome. They took away the cheesiness and ridiculousness of the other Bond movies and made one hell of a movie. I have to be honest and say that I don't really care for the previous Bond films but this one was great. I am really looking forward to Quantum of Solace now.,positive
One of my favorite Bond films. I'm so convinced that Daniel Craig is Bond it scares me. All around a great film.,positive
Disappointing... but the car was sexy.,negative
"I loved Daniel Craig as Bond; he gave it an edge that the others lacked. Sean Connery was suave and sophisticated, but it was more tongue in cheek.",positive
no 1 guilty pleasure... Craig's Bond rocks,positive
"The best Bond film for years, Daniel Craig really surprised me with how well he played the character....beats Pierce Brosnan hands down. Some great action and a brill story.",positive
My favorite Bond movie so far,positive
one of the best bond's ever,positive
Birth of New JAMES BOND!,positive
"I've loved James Bond all the way back to the beginning, and I've seen all the actors who play the part. Some have been good and some have not been so good, so I was reluctant to get yet another ""stand-in."" I was wrong in my initial concerns -- Daniel Craig is THE 007. This is a masterpiece, and the James Bond series starts again with a new breath of life.",positive
It changed forever my opinion of Bond movies,positive
"Possibly the only ""rebooted"" Bond movie that really got it right. It has all the right elements of intensity, intrigue, suspense, and of course love and action that a good spy action/thriller movie needs and an attitude that stands above all the failed corn of Brosnan's limpy 007.",positive
"Not what we expect, but it is what Ian Fleming wanted us to see.",negative
Daniel Craig is excellent and this movie is simply excellent.,positive
I love Daniel Craig. I think the scene where he comes out of the water in hot pants should have been longer though. maybe more slow motion.,positive
"the opening scene was shot most brilliantly. great camera angles, lighting, everything. i don't know why i waited so long to see this!",positive
"In my opinion, good action films are hard to come by nowadays. Casino Royale is definitely one of the better made ""modern"" 007 movies. It keeps the classic wit that prevalent in Bond movies, genius action sequences, while at the same time keeping the story or action from getting too far-fetched.",positive
I recall being against Daniel Craig for Bond but... I take it back! Forgive me!?,positive
"saw it on dvd. some cool action scenes, but i found myself fast forwarding through it.",negative
I finally saw this over the weekend. It was awesome.,positive
Very good debut from Daniel Craig.,positive
"The most realistic Bond film ever made. Bond does some killing mistakes as always, but he does a lot this time which makes him more vulnerable and real.",positive
"A Surprise tome that a restart of a series could actuallye decent, hell kick ass. Daniel Craig proved me wrong and damn can't wait for Quantum of Solace.",negative
Best bond yet !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
Best Bond Movie Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
Makes the other Bond movies look ridiculous and a waste of time.,positive
I think this is my new favorite Bond movie. Daniel Craig is great - very believable as a secret agent: much more human than his predecessors. The Madagascar chase scene is incredible.,positive
Not quite Dr. No or Goldfinger...but definitely not Moonraker either.,positive
"The reinvention of Bond! Stunning redrawing of the Bond licence, with Daniel Craig starting out as a newly licensed ""00"" agent. Bodes well for the next one.",negative
Awesome. Love the defibrillator part. And the part when he kicks all the bad guys' butts and then pulls that 6-inch nail out of his back. Soooo badass.,positive
"Best bond in a while, the movie follows the book and it gets back to the basics by getting rid of the outrageous villains, gadgets and plots that got out of hand in some Roger Moore and the Pierce Brosnan eras. This movie does Ian Fleming pride",positive
"Not a fan of the James Bond movies, but I loved this one",positive
way better than the last 3 bond films,positive
"Having never seen a Bond film, this was fairly entertaining. The killing scenes and the betrayal of Bond were the best parts. Dench was a much better actress than I was expecting. Having seen Get Smart earlier this year I couldn't help noticing several parallels.",positive
"Back to basics, the way James Bond should be.",positive
Now Daniel Craig is good-looking. And this has more than enough action. But all the same... me no like.,negative
"bond, sans Q, quips raised eyebrows and all noir for the naughties. Excellent departure from the tech overload mess that was the brosnin era",positive
"I love Bond, and Daniel Craig does a stellar job of revisting the role. Gritty, slick and a torture scene that will make most men cross their legs",positive
"The best bond ever! Opener is awesome, tells the fascinating tale of how Bond became Bond.",positive
"Ever since the first photos of our new Bond surfaced, it seemed I was the only one I knew who liked him and believed in him while everyone else was busy saying ""ew ugly"" ""too blonde"" ""too old"" etc. Well the haters are all sitting the eff down now, in awe! Oh and as if the film wasn't amazing enough, reviving the series and taking away the camp (much like Batman Begins did for Batman) - throwing in Eva Green as Vesper Lynd made it so much better. LOVE.",positive
at first b4 watching the movie . i thought daniel craig will not suit for james bond role .. but he completely changed my opinion in this fantastic movie .. can't wait for the next one,positive
"besides goldeneye, the best Bond to date. Great action and plot...and not so much mindless innuendo. of course, this movie was made because of The Bourne movies, but who cares?",positive
"A great new start to the Bond films, bringing it in with the times making it feel more real and still very entertaining.",positive
The worst JB movie yet...,negative
best bond since timothy dolton even tho i did like pierce brosnan,positive
The new Bond is bad ass and Eva Green is a pretty hot Bond girl,positive
"Craig, the best Bond ever? Excellent film, and certainly more exploratory of Bond's character than any other 007 film.",positive
"I never thought I would like James Blonde, but I can't wait for #2",positive
Bond movies have never been my favorites - This was was more realistic than previous Bond movies and it was action packed!,positive
"this film does to Die Another Day what Batman Begins did to Batman & Robin, i.e. pisses all over it in a big way. Craig is bond. made with style and maturity. One of the best bond films in the last 20+ years.",positive

its one of the deepest 007 films in the line up very good,positive
"[font=Courier New]Casino Royale, I dare say, could be the greatest Bond film in the franchise history. Daniel Craig's performance as a young, cold James Bond is simply mesmerizing.

"When Daniel Craig was first announced as the new Bond I was confounded. Now I'm a believer. Sean Connery, I'll always love you, but I'm Daniel's girl now.",positive
The new Bond is less of a pretty boy charmer and more of a tougher Bourne-type character. This Bond flick starts a more realistic and darker era after the Brosnan years. It's a welcome improvement.,negative
The best 007 movie to date! Daniel Craig fits the bill for 007,positive
"Best Bond movie in years. Craig carries on the 007 torch with style, grace, a a kick ass attitude. 5 Stars all the way.",positive
"The only downfall of this movie is that I was constantly distracted by Daniel Craig's sexiness and it was hard to pay attention to anything else:P But seriously this was a great movie, although I have not seen any of the other Bond movies. This movie was not as far fetched as I was expecting it to be and I was constantly on the edge of my seat from start to finish....ALMOST got a tear from me...almost!",positive
The best Bond since From Russia With Love.,negative
Bonus points for countless Joe Montana jokes!,positive
Daniel Craig may be my new fav Bond.,positive
there really isn't a Bond movie that i don't like,positive
"I had zero expectations for this movie. I didn't like the idea that they were changing the series, starting over, and I though that Daniel Craig was a poor choice for Bond. He wasn't suave and debonair enough. BOY! Was I WRONG! This might be the best James Bond movie ever. Craig is GREAT and this is just a great movie. AWESOME!",positive
Daniel Craig is awesome! Best sense Sean!,positive
"I'm not the biggest James Bond fan. Although, I am intrigued with the series.(whatever that means) I always found it like the Star Trek franchise, silly. But this back to basics, tough guy Bond really stuck with me. There's an incredible chase sequence at the beginning. Poker scenes for the non-Bond fans. The third act suffers as it does little to let the audience know why the movie hasn't ended.",positive
"By far the best Bond movie, so far.",positive
"The best Bond movie...and a great movie in its own right. Action, believable acting, good cinematography...",positive
a lot better then i expected i cant wait for quantom of solace,positive
That would have been a lot more fun if my DVD player had not skipped every 20 seconds half way through the movie.,negative
One of the best Bond films in a LONG long time. The series is finally going back to it's roots without any CGI that made the '90s films look like garbage.,positive
"A horrible, horrible movie, featuring plot holes so massive, not even light can escape their pull. There is not a single scene which survives the application of basic logic. Not to ruin anything for anyone, but let me toss out one or two examples: Let's suppose your a shady money-launderer, and some really evil dictator gives you $150 million of his own money for you to hold on to. In the process, he makes it exquisitely clear that if you lose his cash, you're dead. Would you: a) put that money in a nice safe bond fund, b) or short airline stock. If you said b, maybe this is the movie for you. Now, let's suppose you foolishly shorted airline stock. Would you have made that decision based on: a) expert financial savvy and knowledge; or b) your secret plan to blow up the airline's one new plane? Before you say b, let me remind you that, as a shady money-launderer, you probably want to keep your existence on the down-low. Setting up a conspiracy like this increases the odds that you will be discovered. Also, go ahead and think about whether destroying a single plane would really cause the airline stock to crash. I strongly suspect the dictator will be non-plussed if this scheme of yours doesn't go well. Not that I'm an expert or anything, but your plan is to blow up the plane while it's on the ground - if I might offer a suggestion, think about making it blow up in-flight, since that could conceivably affect customer relations, which would impact the bottom line. Fine, do it your way. Strangely enough, your plan is foiled by James Bond, and now the shares ... well, for the sake of the movie, assume that for some reason, Bond's involvment has caused the airline stock to double in price - evidently, over night. I realize that's beyond preposterous but you put yourself into this mess in the first place, not me. Granted, the way the stock apparently took off like a rocket was hard to foresee, and I feel for you there. Anywho, you've gone ahead and lost the dictator's $150 million and you really, really need to replace it. Fortunately, in the grand scheme of cinematic villainry, $150 million isn't that much money so you probably have reserves or access to enough money to cover this, right? You don't? What kind of financial whiz are you? Oh, the kind that tries to blow up a plane to manipulate stock prices. If you get out of this, you should take a few refresher courses on criminality or something. So, you need $150 million pretty quickly, but on the plus side, you almost managed to blow up the plane - in fact, but for an absurd action sequence involving a speeding fuel tanker, you just might have succeed. You clearly do have some criminal skills. Keeping that in mind, do you get your hands on $150 million by a) hatching a robbery, kidnapping, extortion, etc., or b) arrange a high-stakes poker tourney with a $150 million pot and hope to win it, without cheating or anything. If you selected b, you just might be the irredeemably lamest villain ev-ARRRR. When, to no one's surprise, you lose the tournament in a show-down with James Bond (who's playing under his real name but you didn't bother to kick him out, even though you should've known he was there more or less to foil you) do you: a) arrange another game and don't invite Bond this time, or b) torture Bond (by hitting him in the balls) to force him to give you his winnings. If you said b, go back a step and ask yourself why you wouldn't just cheat in the first place if you're going to resort to strong-arm theft anyway. Casino Royale's over-arching failure comes from taking itself so seriously. Other Bond films were equally ridiculous but they had a whimsical quality, drawing the audience in on the joke and taking you to a place where your brain doesn't worry about logic. Here, the joke is on you for sitting through two-and-a-half hours of utter nonsense.",negative
Best ever bond movie.,positive
a product of the times. flawed but solid reboot for the seasoned spy series.,positive
"I am NOT a James Bond fan. The Husband is, so I have seen them, but have never really enjoyed them. Until now. I wasn't even going to see this movie until I saw the trailer and then HAD TO SEE IT, and I ended up seeing it twice in the theatre. GREAT movie. Loved the action and the story. Awesome action movie.",positive
"Remarkable reimagining of the James Bond series. This movie does for stale action franchises what Christopher Nolan's ""Bat-Man"" series did for comic book movies - adds a credible layer of grit and realism, in an arena sorely saturated by absurd set pieces and gimmicky plot devices. In the true spirit of a revision, ""Casino Royale"" serves as a sort of modern-day origin story for 007. Bond must bankrupt a merciless terrorist financier in a high-stakes card game in order to trace how a terrorist outfit completes its insidious worldwide operations. However, this film functions even better as an action-packed exploration of Bond's psyche, and how he became the steely killer at the center of arguably the world's most popular, long-standing action franchise.",positive
"I was presently surprised with this one. I think this is one of the few examples where they can have more than 2 villains in a movie and it actually work, plus I think different sides of who James Bond is, rather than 007, shows more in this than some previous examples. Daniel Craig really is one of the best Bonds since Sean Connery.",positive
Bond is here a what a show he is,positive
Best Bond Movie...Daniel Craig Rules!!!,positive
"New Bond better than ever. Saw this for my birthday. Cant wait for Quantum of Solace to come out. Hope on my birthday again, that would be great.",positive
my all time favorite movie,positive
"I know I could get cursified by die hard Connery fan for saying so, but I think this is the best Bond Movie made thus far. I have always been a fan of 007, especially (cursifiction #2) Roger Moore's Bond (hey, I grew up with them). But this bond surpassed them all. Martin Campbell did to Bond what Christopher Nolan did with Batman, Made him Real and Gritty again and I loved it.",positive
Daniel Craig has brought james bond out of the box.,positive
I don't like this one so much!!!!,negative
"I spent most of the time drooling over Daniel Craig, but the film is excellent.",positive
Best Bond film ever.,positive
Wow!! Daniel Craig did an amazing job even though I had my doubts before watching it.,positive
Really good! My new favorite Bond.,positive
Craig spat in the face of critics who knocked him before the film was even finished. Awesome flick! I hope to be at Quantum of Solace opening night.,positive
Amazing movie. This one makes my top ten favorites!,positive
second only to goldeneye.,positive
"yay for more gung-ho shooting, boo for angsty bond.",negative
Good movie.... though i never saw the first one.... I still liked it!,positive
"Best Bond Ever. Craig is the best bond. I love the realism. Even thou the movie has no gizmo's like the previous installations, this is the best Bond flick ever made. Period. The sequel starring Craig as bond will be rockin' I tell ya. Hope it's even better than Casino Royale. Quantum of Solace is hittin' theaters November 7th. There's only one thing that bothers me in both Craig's bond movies. Why does he crash his stunning Aston Martin DBS twice? Yes, he's gonna crash his new DBS in Quantum of Solace just to spoil for ya'll.",positive
Finally a decent recent Bond movie.,positive
Very interesting and refreshing - shows Bond becoming the badass we know and love. Explores his origins and motivations and delivers a complex twist ending. Priceless.,negative
"The best James Bond since Sean Conery. Of course no one can top that man, but Daniel Craig did me proud. I love looking at him :)",positive
"Great Bond, Great Movie.",positive
"From the very stylish beginning through to the uber-cool ending Casino Royale marks the return of Bond from shit-heap the franchise found itself in after ""Die Another Day"". Craig takes Bond back to a grittier, less polished individual who makes as many mistakes as he does accomplishments, creating a far more satisfying character study than Brosnan could ever dream of. The story is great, simple and realistic. No invisible cars or fencing pop queens.. All in all it's James Bond back to where it should be, classic, witty and most-of-all, bloody interesting.",positive
"For a Bond fan, it is utterly sad to see this guy..",negative
Super cool! Daniel Graig is awesome as bond - even with the ears.,positive
The new bond was born.. he is Daniel Craig.Daniel Craig is perfect as James Bond... he showed to us the new bond. fresh and unpredictable..,positive
"Aunque no puedo hablar por la era de Sean Connery, Casino Royale supera facilmente a todas las peliculas de Pierce Brosnan. Daniel Craig le agrega una intensidad a 007 que nunca antes habia tenido, y Martin Campbell crea un balance perfecto entre espectaculares escenas de accion y un muy completo desarrollo de personajes. Ademas, es la pelicula de Bond mejor fotografiada de todas, sin discusion.",positive
"The new updated Bond is edgier, colder, deadlier & more forceful.",positive
It has some things that don't groove with the typical 007 recipe. But we needed a breather from the same old thing anyway.,negative
"Daniel Craig is Bond. He was Smooth, Suave, Sexy, and Dangerous (his performance deserves the capital letters). He did such an excellent job that I cannot to see the next installment.",positive
Bond is Back! A trendy/hokey backdrop (No Limit Poker Tournament) is excused by getting everything else you could ever want from a Bond Flick. It's such a shame about that Aston Martin.,positive
"great lead into the Daniel Craig era, pumped with action. Great.",positive
the best James Bond Yet,negative
This movie is awesome!,positive
This is the only James Bond movie I have seen and I must say that I am impressed. There was a great level of character depth.,positive
My favorite Bond movie to date,positive
This gets a 2. it WOULD have got a 4. Daniel Craig would also have got 4 kciks to his none existant knackers if id have been near him when he crashed that Austin M.,negative
I love Bond and this is the best film of the series so far. Daniel Craig has taken the role by the scruff of its neck and exceeded expectations.,positive
"Bond the way Flemming envisioned him, mean, nasty, ego driven and tough. This Bond is a pitbull on a long leash, barely under control.",positive
What can i say abt it,positive
"Ca m'a reconcilie avec les James Bond nouvelle generation. Le grain du film donne un cote retro pas deplaisant. Et surtout, la course poursuite du debut du film est carrement haletante !",positive
"My favorite of the ""new"" Bond flicks.",positive
Best Bond movie so far,negative
"One of the best Bond film if not the best. It had some old school 007 style in it like the Sean Connery era and the new school like the Pierce Brosnan with all the action. Most people would disagree with me because I liked that there wasn't any gadgets used, they finally made it realistic like the novels. Daniel Craig is perfect as James Bond.",positive
The best Bond movie so far,positive
"love the angry, ruthless james bond",positive
"great movie, cant wait for the next one in november!",positive
"Some good action scenes, but I don't like Daniel Craig. Connery is much better.",negative
a good bond and a good film,positive
"""Now the whole world's gonna know that you died scratching my balls!""",positive
The best Bond movie I've seen yet,positive
the best film as the doesnt have his stupid gadgets with him in this one,negative
Bond goes back to the basics. Brutal. Sexy. Action.,negative
"I loved this movie. It was an excellent remake of a british movie icon. If it wasn't for this movie, I doubt that the whole reinventing craze would've got started. Well done.",positive
Bond movie that is good on normal movie standards. I guess anything can happen. I could not have cared less about latest Bond movies and that was reason why I didn't watch this until now. This is more like Bourne movies that older Bond movies. Somewhere in between but closer to Bourne. Made me wait the sequal.,positive
Daniel Craig = Pimp in this movie. I to be honest have never really gotten into the Bond flicks. This movie however I liked. Daniel Craig plays the role perfectly. Not as some flamboyant british prick but as a charming sociopath which was terrific,positive
One of my favourite bond films!,positive
Excellent but I would prefer Pierce Bonsnan,positive
"A breath of fresh air. Finally a Bond movie with a bit of depth. The characters actually have meaning and there is reasons that lead to action in this movie. Eva green is gorgeous and Craig is just downright tough guy. He reminds me of sean Connery and would not look out of place playing Bond in the earlier movies. Casino Royale can be compared against the great Bond movies Goldfinger and Golden Eye. If not even better. This movie has hit the ""straigt flush"" but not quite yet the royal.",positive
"Bond is Back! They updated the series to the post 9/11 world and for the first time ever bond is given dimensions. All action have a consequence and that is something refreshing.We see what created the man. the chemistry between green and craig is intoxicating. the action is exciting with some great stunts (No more computer generated bond of ""die another day"").This is the best of the series since Goldeneye and arguably the best of all time.This is bond brought into the 21st century and he showed he still is the best in the business",positive
"Despite being somewhat overlong and lacking some of the charm of earlier bond movies this is still a great tense thriller, with enough Bond-ness to make it what it should be. Daniel Craig makes a good Bond in the original Connery mould and this is a really good film, not quite GoldenEye, Goldfinger or Dr No but top five Bond films for sure.",positive
"Adrenaline will rush through you just by watching this film. Intense and thought-provoking, both great qualities of a great movie.",positive
I Love Bond Movies!! this is too good!!,positive
"This Bond film goes beyond the usual, especially the usual spectacle of Pierce Brosnan Bond movies. There's still a ton of fun action, but it's mixed with more character development. It helps the viewer gain a better understanding of who Bond is beyond the common knowledge of the character. It does go on a bit long, but it's paced fairly well, so you aren't left bored. It was definitely a good way to reboot a series.",positive
"The British government's ""blunt weapon"" is given a different guideline to follow in this twenty-first addition to the James Bond franchise: be motivated only by your duty and don't show remorse for your actions. During every re-casting, each actor that stepped into the shoes of Ian Fleming's lustful, licensed-to-kill assassin was, at the time, unknown to the movie world (except perhaps Pierce Brosnan, who seemed like a mere distraction compared to the likes of Moore and Connery) and Craig is no different. That being said, he gives 007 an unremorseful soul and moves in on Connery, the most suave Bond to date, and his top spot. His prey this time is a scar-faced, mathematical genius (Mikkelson) who shows off his intellect by competing in a poker match and then uses the proceeds to finance terrorism. But what is a Bond film without a voluptuous Bond girl? Money handler Vesper Lynd (Green) ignites a flame in Bond's heart and roasts it on a skewer. This reboot to the franchise is second only to Goldfinger.",positive
"WHEN I was a lad, the release of a new James Bond film was something to be excited about. Sadly, it's been a long time since that was true. Years of jokey double entendres and safari suits - not to mention Austin Powers - have bled most of the juice out of the franchise for me. Even the casting of Daniel Craig - an outrage which sent some fans into apoplexy - left me indifferent. Well, I was wrong. First things first: Craig is a brilliant James Bond, the best since Sean Connery. Forget Pierce Brosnan, Craig makes Timothy Dalton look like Roger Moore. Probably the best actor ever to tackle the role of the infamously one-dimensional spy, he brings just enough depth to the part and more than proves he can break heads and shoot straight. Craig's Bond is arrogant, cold, contemptuous of authority and cruel to women. Just like he was in Ian Fleming's books, then. He's not particularly funny, either - but at least that means we can wave goodbye to all those cringe-worthy double entendres. We see Bond fall in love and gradually become the icon we all know so well, and that's just as fascinating as watching Craig tackle the role for the first time. With taut, efficient direction by Martin Campbell and an intelligent, character-driven script written by Bond veterans Neil Purvis and Robert Wade and brushed up by Oscar-winning Paul Haggis, it's a movie you can recommend to your friends as a film in its own right. And when was the last time you could say that about anything with James Bond in it? As well as changing the leading man, the producers have rebooted the character, as if beginning the entire series all over again. This is Bond at the start of his licenced killing career - but still set in 2006. This causes a bit of confusion early on. The pre-credits prologue, set in Prague, shows Bond ruthlessly achieving his 00 status in very Cold War-style black and white - before the film opens out into a world of mobile phones, secure websites and Dame Judi Dench as M. The plot - Bond takes part in a $100m poker match in a bid to bankrupt and ensnare the moneyman behind a cabal of international terrorists - is more complicated than ever and, to be frank, begins to drag a little in the closing stretches of the film's two hours and 20 minutes (it's the longest Bond film ever). But the action - especially a remarkable sequence featuring Bond in pursuit of free-running ace Sebastien Foucan and a madcap pursuit across the runways of Miami Airport, not to mention a stunt featuring the record number of cannon rolls in a car - is consistently exciting and brilliantly orchestrated by Campbell to generate real tension and jeopardy. Set in the usual spectacular spread of global locations - here including Madagascar, London, Uganda, Venice, Montenegro, the Bahamas, Lake Como and Florida - the roller-coaster ride the film provides will definitely provide a new lease of life for what has been a creaky old franchise of late. There's no deranged plot to take over the world - but the smaller scale mission actually helps the film's sense of realism (such as it is). There are no dozy ""comic"" supporting performances. The rest of the cast - especially the ever-brilliant Dench, icily intelligent Eva Green as Treasury official and love interest Vesper Lynd, Mads Mikkelsen as villain-in-chief Le Chiffre, Giancarlo Giannini as Bond's field support Mathis and an under-used but excellent Jeffrey Wright as CIA chum Felix Leiter - are all note-perfect and all take the job seriously. And there's no place for overblown fancy gadgets. If there's a flaw, it's the section when Bond becomes increasingly infatuated with Lynd. Even if you're not ahead of him with the plot by this point - and you will be - it is a bit of a stretch believing that the bloke we saw brutally killing a bad guy in an East European toilet in the opening two minutes is the one getting all giddy on a romantic break in Venice. But the elements we're left with are far more in tune with the original spirit of Fleming's amoral anti-hero - in both the books and the early films - than anything we've seen for decades.",positive
"Umm, yeah, its cool, i guess...",positive
"It's a Bond movie! Guns, cars, gadgets (a lot less than the others), action, sex, everything is in there. Daniel Craig really does the job as the new 007, but the movie is really long for nothing. If the love story between Bond and Vesper would've been less present, this would've help a lot to cut many useless and boring scenes. Let's wait and see if the sequel will excused those scenes.",negative
"Despite the critism of Daniel Craig as the new Bond, I liked this movie. I say give the guy a chance. I think he has a little of all of the past Bonds. I liked the idea of them going back to the beginning and showing why James Bond is the way he is. Some of the previous Bond outings have been lacking in storyline, but this one has the story. the only thing I missed were the cool gadgets... maybe they'll introduce or rather re-introduce us to the Q branch in Quantum of Solace",positive
"Surely Die Another Day wasn't the worst Bond film ever and Brosnan still was entertaining as Bond in that film, so a Batman- style ""reboot"" was really needed, but once you see the film you really come to understand what was going wrong with the series. What Bond really has been since Ian Fleming wrote the first James Bond novel, Casino Royale, the character has been a dark, mysterious figure, you don't want to mess with, although he's still charming and the gentleman spy we all know. But with the way that Pierce Brosnan was playing Bond, he turned the charm factor too high, in films where the villains plots were getting way too fantastic and the gadgets were getting too unreal. A laser in space? An invisible car? Halle Berry as an American secret agent? Com' on! Then, four years later, we get Casino Royale, which introduces the newest James Bond- Mr. Daniel Craig, and right from the opening sequence (which director Martin Campbell and cinematographer Phil Meheux brilliantly shot in black and white) in which Bond earns his double o status to a construction site chase in the jungles of Africa to another on the runways of Miami Airport to a pro-longed game of poker at the titled location to a finale in a collapsing building in Venice and finally the classic introduction at the very end once Bond confronts the man who betrayed him. The action set pieces are alone stuff that we've have missed in past Bond adventures. Plus when you add in a story that seems ripped from the headlines, plus a realistic story involving Bond and the first woman he truly loves, the film tops off as being the best 2 and a half hours (a record for a Bond film) that a Bond fan could ever have.",positive
"Was never a bond fan, but this film was amazing, except for that poor beautiful Aston!",positive
"Lots of guns, beautiful women, explosions, badassery, and everything else I watch a Bond movie for. Loved the way Bond handled the poker game.",positive
"Well this wasn't the Bond I'm used to, both in character and look. Daniel Craig is much too rough looking for the Bond I know, but then again he doesn't play the Bond I know so it ends up working. Also this is a young Bond, not the suave, calculated and emotionally detached Bond of before, he makes quite a few big mistakes and pays for them, hence learning from them. I think the next film with Craig will be much smoother. My only complaints for this one is how the basics constraints of the Bond time line are thrown away, as current events are referred to when Bond is supposed to be new to MI6, how does that work? Also the story gets a little unfocused and muddy at points. Craig is a great, fresh Bond, but Sean Conary will always be 007 to me.",positive
"Best Bond film for a while but nowhere near perfect. The card scene in particular was a bit ridiculous for anyone who knows the rules of poker. Still, a vast improvement on other recent Bond films and the future of the series looks brighter.",negative
"Ok, it was a very exiting action movie!! Daniel Craig was very hot in this movie!! he pull it off!! .. but i think they got off the 007 Agent with this movie, they made it very violent and... 007 James Bond has to be very smooth, sexy, polite, nice, well dress, and funny at the same time, but with Daniel they did it very serious!.. grate video effects! but too much violence !",positive
Intense and beautiful the whole way through.,positive
"pretty good stuff. Not as good as I expected, but definately a good start to the new beginning of the franchise",negative
"Action is incredible, and for once the show the 007 as realistic as possible. No spoof here.",positive
Kick ass movie! Best bond movie in a long time!,positive
"Finally a Bond that strikes fear in people. Unlike with Pierce Brosnan, this is a Bond that you fear coming after you. Fantastic piece of work. Action scenes and story line come together in a streamline of effectivness.",positive
Intense remake of the original,positive
"Ã¤Ã¤Ã¤h, loppua kohden lÃ¤ssÃ¤hti... enkÃ¤ tykkÃ¤Ã¤ Craigista Bondina!",negative
a very good james bond movie !,positive
Disappointed in this one...I thought this movie was supposed to re-invent the franchise. Blah!,negative
my favorite Bond movie,positive
"A layered and beautifully-shot film, ""Casino Royale"" is darkly brilliant and precise.",positive
A revamp of the Bond franchise which cuts it down to the basics . It is gritty and goes to the beginning of the chracter and shows you how he became the way he is,positive
"in this prequel,Bond hasn't become quite as jaded and chauvinistic as in previous films",negative
"A new addition to the bond movies, daniel craig fits right in and is second best to shawn. Action packed and great story, but I didn't see what was entertaining with watching people play poker.",positive
"Yawn. Lasted an age - I thought I would age and die watching this film, and that was jsut waiting for the one hour mark so we could have a tea break.",negative
This movie is so awesome! Some parts kind of bug me best it's ok in the end!,positive
"I love Daniel Craig, he's the PERFECT Bond :) A Brilliant Film :D",positive
"""The left one it tickles"" Already cult",positive
"The best bond in the last 20 years, very old school.",positive
"Not a Bond fan but I loved this - loved the ""origin"" of Bond, the arrogance, the condescension, very different from previous outiings. Well-written too.",positive
"Action packed, the story was actually similar to the book. I know they had to change the game from baccarat to poker cuz nobody knows how to play baccarat in the US.",negative
Very good pick for the main role. Liked it much better than those with Pierce Brosnan. ...and he had the same cell phone than me :D,positive
"fast paced, thrilling movie i really enjoyed and i have never even liked bond movies!",positive
Portraying James Bond as a person rather than a terminator who can't make any single mistake.,positive
I love the new Bond.,positive
didn't like it much.,negative
i still like the other guy better as james bond,negative
skeptically pleased.,positive
I never thought they could make Bond better but they did.,positive
Il miglior bond dai tempi di Connery. SarÃ  forse per il fatto che la trama l'aveva giÃ  scritta Ian Fleming? Eccezionale in BD...,positive
Kul. Och ganska snyggt faktiskt. Men inte tillrÃ¤ckligt kompext.,negative
"Martin Campbell finally got it right with this one. If youre going to retire (most) of the tongue in cheek tone, make sure to find a Bond with the right attitude. Hope he stays on for a while.",positive
a good reboot of the Bond franchise; Craig is a good pick and the action scenes are well done,negative
best actiono samsh movie of all time,positive
Good 007 movie they seem to be back on track as to what and who 007 really is,positive
"""The bitch is dead...""",positive
I have never seen any of the older bonds but this one is bad ass.,positive
Best Bond film in a really long time. Brosnan just had bad scripts so it wasn't his fault but Craig makes all the others except Connery look like nobbly-kneed girls.,positive
"Daniel Craig hmmmmn best Bond yet, even if you arent a Bond fan check this one out!",positive
This is a movie. Good movie.,positive
"The only thing I didn't like was the poker scenes, because A) the hand were sooo unrealistic. Those situation only happen once in a lifetime if at all; and B) that guy that was explaining all the hands and amounts of money in the pot to the girl, who secretly a device to explain members of the audience who don't understand poker what is going on. Every time he would say ""there is 'x' amount in the pot"" I would laugh a little bit more. Oh and the fact he was driving a Ford Fusion, stupidest product placement ever. I wonder how much Ford paid for that one. Although it's nice to see the Aston Martin comeback both vintage and new models. But minor details, James Bond is always good times. The rest of the movie is explosions, half naked girls, exciting fights, cool cars and exotic locales",positive
This has to be the first James Bond movie I've actually liked..,positive
"What a story daniel craig makes an excellent bond, Its a real life story something you could actually see happening, great cast eva green is amazing. This is probably one of the best bonds ever.",positive
good movie. i saw it a few too many times in a row and got kinda tired of it. but it's a really good movie. can't wait for the next one!,positive
"I went to see this on the opening night and Daniel Crag blew me away, as my expectations of his Bond were low, to say the least. However, for me he was miles above his forerunners, the only one who ever appealed to me was Connery. The whole cast were superb and what a great story, leaving other, so predictable) Bond films trailing way behind.",positive
"Sometimes it is better if people should not judge the movie before it comes out. I know I did, and I hereby retract my opinion about this movie, how I was wrong. And this time, I'm glad I was wrong. This movie is GREAT. I had doubts whether they could pull it off, but they did! This is one of the best James Bond's movies I ever watched. Just awesome.",positive
awesome daniel craig is the best bond since sean connery,positive
great movie but I cannot stand Daniel Craig. so he was in the way.,positive
One of the best Bond films,positive
One of the best Bond ever made.,positive
Best Bond movie so far.,positive
"Forget every other Bond movie, this was the best. The first 15 minutes of the movie are a must see",positive
"Best Bond. Movie and actor. Sorry Sean Connery fans, Daniel Craig is the man. This movie rightfully takes some cues from the Bourne series, but maintains Bond's distinctly arrogant and brash personality making it feel different from the latter series. Bond really seems almost as dangerous to himself as he is to his enemies. I can't wait to see what they do with the next one.",positive

Daniel Craig is the new bond & the best yet. Craig takes Bond to the next level by showing us what he's really made of by using violence in a way the other Bonds couldn't. Casino Royale has alot of action at every turn. The film also provides alot of nice set pieces. The acting is top notch from everyone on screen. Overall Craig is the best Bond to date & probably ever will be & I'm sure everyone will agree with me on that. I recommend this movie for bond & action fans. This is one bond you have to see. Its heartstopping full adrenaline rush action bond movie. Two very big thumbs way up, 5 stars.",positive
"Not one of my favorites, but people seem to like it. I thought that for a movie named Casino Royale that there would be a lot more gambling shown, but alas only a few hands. I am not really happy with this cold and feelingless james bond. I prefere a more charming, charismatic, slik james bond. But I am very happy to be rid of Pierce Brosnan.",negative
Back to the real style of the books - Daniel Craig - best Bond ever for me.,positive
Love the new Bond movie and style. I'm in love.,positive
"After seeing this film (more than once in the theatre) I re-read the novel, and was pleasantly to find out true the movie is to the book.",positive
"Watched it over a couple days... The only thing I didn't like about this was that it seemed VERY long. Other than that, very entertaining!",positive
"I have never watched a whole James Bond movie, even when I thought I'd enjoy them when Remington Steele (aka Pierce Brosnan) played the role. And here I am 2 years later just getting around to seeing this one. Wow! Daniel Craig is perfect. I guess he's ""grittier"" than Bonds of old, which suits me just fine. The action sequences were intense, the plot was excellent, the women were hot and Bond was even hotter! I'm looking forward now to the oddly named ""Quantum of Solace."" Hopefully there will be at least one beach scene with Craig! : )",positive
Good old James Bond cant go wrong. One of the best movies for '06 thats for shizzle!!! Eva Green was marvellous...deviating from the Sexy Bimbo Syndrome stereotype that you see in a lot o movies and unfortunately in real life also. Daniel Craig did a brillant job as bond and portrayed the complexity of his character brilliantly without giving TOO much away... Definitely a movie id see again and again...with long breaks in between...,positive
"possibly one of the best bond films. it keeps the elements of the classic bond films as well as competing with the present action flicks. like many others, daniel craig has proved to me that he makes one hell-of-a bond! and finally, a bond girl i can admire!",positive
"I really loved this one...dirty, gritty & back to less fantastical spying!!",positive
"OK, Sean Connery IS James Bond in my mind, but Daniel Craig is the Bond that Ian Fleming wrote. Best Bond ever.",positive
"It's strange at the beginning to see a blond James Bond ... Anyway, the intelligence and the action of this movie are great. Moreover it seems that the character of Eva Green will always be J.B. only true love. It's cute :)",positive
Didn't really care for James Bond movies (the more recent ones; I haven't seen the Sean Connery ones) until I saw this one with Daniel Craig. James Bond with raw emotion -- it was great!,positive
This could be my favourite bond movie next to goldfinger .It is just what the series needed!Daniel Craig is perfect as a rawer and tougher Bond he pisses all over Pierce Brosnan .Eva Green is also a great choice for a Bond girl .The plot stays close to that of the book and the action is the best of any of the Bond films.,positive
"Sean Connerry has always been James Bond to me, but Daniel Craig is giving him a run for his money.",positive
I just don't like how Daniel Craig portrays Bond...he didn't do him justice.,positive
"The best 007 movie ever!Loved Daniel Craigs performance..and him of course:)A new emotinal sophisticated Bond. Also, Eva Green was so elegant and smart.",positive
"A fabulous action film beautifully directed with a fantastic performance from Daniel Craig as a brutal, cold Bond bringing back credibility to the character that has been missing for a long time.",positive
simple...its james bond....what mopre do you need to know...awesome and it delivers,positive
finally a decent bond film,positive
It's a typical James Bond movie!,negative
It's good but the older ones a far better,positive
Very convincing Bond.,negative
"Daniel Craig is a good addition to the ""bond"" collection...looking forward to the next movie Quantum of Solace..",positive
"While it on occasion unifies too closely with the franchises past entries, Casino Royale's intense atmosphere, breathtaking action, and Daniel Craig giving the most charismatic Bond this side of Sean Connery makes Casino Royale one of the best entries in the 007 series while taking the series in a bold new direction.",positive
"I don't care how skeptical people were, blond hair or not, Daniel Craig is one kick-ass James Bond.",positive
"One of my favorite Bond movies. I like the Daniel Craig Bond movies the best out of the Bond franchise. Daniel Craig makes an excellent Bond. Great fight scenes, suspense and classic Bond action.",negative
"Not quite up to par for a Bond movie, or most any action movie for that matter.",negative
"I think I've finally found my Bond. As I said to the room when we watched it ""I don't want a Bond who knows he's going to fuck you and act like it. I want a Bond who knows he's gonna fuck the girl but acts totally indifferent until he does.""",positive
"After the last three Bond movies, I'd lost hope in the series altogether until I saw this one. They decided to take the movie in a much grittier direction and I really enjoyed it. A very good beginning to the James Bond story. Looking forward to the sequel.",positive

[i]Casino Royale [/i]is a breath of fresh air in the long-running franchise, and in my opinion it isn't only the best Bond since the Sean Connery days, it's the best Bond movie ever. It's much more gritty and intense than past entries in the franchise, with more well-rounded characters and much more emotional impact than ever before. But that doesn't get in the way of the action and suspense, which there's still plenty of. In my mind, [i]Casino Royale [/i]is a perfect action movie - a great balance of character and thrills that is never dull for a minute of its running time.

"i boycoted this film untill tonight. after hearing it was my hero, Quentin Tarantino's idea and he was givin no credit. also after hearing that alot of the old conventions would be thrown away. i though it only proper too ignore it. now dont get me wrong by no means am i any authorty on james bond movies, iv seen them all atleast once with the exception of ""from russier with love"" which i watch once a year. still after much consideration...and peer presure, i gave in. this is how i feel about casino royel. Danial craig isnt the best bond, but he suits the no nonsesne style of the movie good enough. this first hour is slow, but this is a common fault with bond movies i have found. eva green is one of the most beautifull bond girls ever and gives a truly fantastic preformence. some fine action sequence's and brilliant scenes of tension speed the story up. but still occsionly feels flat and more like one of the bourne films. addmitedly, yes. the ending dose send shivers up my spine, but i cant finish the review with out saying i felt it was all "" a little over rated"". it was an easy gag too remove all of the crudentials of previus bond outings and then put them back in again, as if it was a ""new gimic"" that was just a cheep trick. this is as enjoyable as one peirse brosnons bonds, if perhaps a little more gritty. i find this type of genra differcult as it is. but bond usaly managed too keep my attention for a one off. this sucseeded in that. although i have too emphersise....no more than the others. and certinly no more than connery.",negative

With the abysmal failure of the last couple movies, Casino Royale blows the doors wide open. It's a huge, but welcome, change. The campyness is dropped and the characters are complex and interesting. We're only one movie in, but Craig is already the best actor to take on the Bond role. The movie is a little too long and the pacing is also a bit off, but the action is good enough to keep you on hte edge of your seat. I've always been a Bond fan, and I think the time had come for a change.

"The Pawn. The Con. The Bond Saw it again! Excellent movie, it's my favorite Bond movie so far. I'm not a huge Bond fan, but I do enjoy them on a purely popcorn level and this was definitely one of the best in recent memory. The action sequences are brilliantly shot and edited for maximum impact and are some of the best out of any Bond movie. Daniel Craig gives an excellent performance as Bond. It's hard to say whether he's better than any of the other Bonds: Connery and Brosnan felt right for the style of Bond movies they were in. Here, as suits the overall tone of the film, Bond is much more of a sadist, a cold-hearted killer with very little sense of empathy and Craig, with his piercing eyes, suits the role very well. He's charming and funny when required and totally convincing in the action sequences. The violence is less cartoon-like and flippant, too, with every punch, kick and shooting looking like they really hurt. Also, the story is just much more engaging than many a Bond film; the script's not going to win awards but it's consistently inventive and intriguing. Great directing and performances from everyone involved, along with excellent cinematography! Highly Recommended!!! The movie begins in the city of Prague, Czech Republic, where James Bond has tracked down an MI6 agent, Dryden, who was selling information to enemies for profit. They chat about what it takes to be a Double O agent (one of the requirements is making two kills) and Bond casually tells him his contact died, ""Not well."" Intercut with the conversation are black and white-filmed scenes of Bond in a men's room, fighting with Dryden's own contact, a man named Fisher. Bond eventually shoves the man's face in an overflowing sink and he falls to the floor, apparently dead. Dryden taunts Bond, asking him if he felt any remorse or guilt over killing Fisher. Dryden says that Bond ""needn't worry, the second is--"" at which point Bond shoots Dryden dead. Bond puts his pistol away saying ""Yes, considerably."" (Though not said explicitly, Bond found the killing of Dryden, his second such kill, ""considerably"" easier than the first.) In flashback, Fisher recovers from Bond's attempt to drown him and picks up his pistol. The frame instantly shifts to the series' iconic ""gun barrel"" sequence. Bond spins around shoots the man. Blood runs down the frame, prompting the opening titles. We next are in Uganda where a terrorist group is meeting with ""Le Chiffre"" who is a private banker to terrorist groups around the world. The broker for the deal is a Mr. White, taking their money and investing it and manipulating stocks so they get a 100% return on the investment. The terrorists, lead by a man named Obanno, agree to allow the money to be taken for Le Chiffre's nefarious purposes. In Madagascar, Bond, on his first mission as a ""00"", is working with another agent, Carter, monitoring a terrorist, Mollaka, who is gambling on a match between a cobra and a mongoose... Bond's inexperienced partner agent is exposed after Mollaka gets a cell call and the terrorist bolts from the scene. Bond chases the man, who is an experienced ""free runner"" (parkour) who leads Bond through a construction site, onto several sky cranes and finally to the Nambutu embassy where he seeks asylum. Bond charges into the embassy, in direct contravention of international law and his orders, and catches Mollaka. Bond fights his way thru the halls of the embassy and finally finds himself surrounded by armed guards. The ambassador appears and orders Bond to let Mollaka go. Bond shoots the terrorist and a nearby gas tank and escapes in the explosion. He also steals the backpack Mollaka was carrying. Searching through the backpack, he finds a cell phone and a bomb. Bond examines the man's messages briefly and keeps the phone. Back at MI6, M is furious that 007's violent actions were caught on tape at the Nambutu embassy. Bond later sneaks into M's home and hacks her top-level clearance so he can trace where the cell phone call originated from. When M enters she's startled and lectures him on proper protocol and conduct. She also tells him to go on a brief vacation until she can decide how best to deal with him. Bond had discovered that the call to Mollaka originated in the Bahamas and so Bond goes to their to find out who made the call and why. He ends up finding a middle man, Dmitrios, who was working for Le Chiffre and that he was hired to find someone who could carry out a task for Le Chiffre. Bond meets Dmitrios and plays poker with him, winning his 1964 Aston Martin. Bond uses the Aston to finagle a romantic evening with Dmitrios' spurned wife, Solange, to get information about her husband. She tells Bond that Dmitrios is going to Miami. Bond follows him there where he confronts Dmitrios. after seeing him put a bag away for someone to pick up later. Bond kills Dmitrios when he's held at knifepoint, however, the bag goes missing and Bond follows the man, Carlos, hired for Mollaka's job. Le Chiffre will have Carlos destroy the prototype for a large airline named Skyfleet. The prototype will be the largest aircraft in the world; it's public destruction will bankrupt Skyfleet causing their stock to plummet, an event that Le Chiffre thinks will earn millions. Bond foils the plot and Le Chiffre loses over $100 Million dollars. Now a marked man, Le Chiffre must find another way to earn the money back so his investors will not kill him. He sets up the high stakes match in Montenegro for 10 players with entry fees at $10 Million each + a $5 Million buy back should they lose all their money. M is taking 007 through a crime scene where Solange was found dead. M informs Bond of the poker game and agrees to let Bond continue the mission since he's the best poker player in the service. M also implants a homing device on 007 so she can track him anywhere. The British Government will be putting up the money and we are introduced to Vesper Lynd who is the government agent who is going to monitor Bond and give a go, no-go should he lose the money. They talk on the train about each other, Vesper commenting on his cold nature and Bond remarking on how Vesper is retentive. Upon arriving they are to pose as a married couple and meet Rene Mathis, their contact in Montenegro. Each poker player has their money in a Swiss bank in escrow while they play and each one has a password to keep the money secured. Vesper has the account number but only 007 knows the password. On the first hand, 007 loses a chunk of cash to figure out how Le Chiffre bluffs (his physical ""tell"" involves him placing his left hand near his wounded eye), however Vesper is not at all amused. After a lengthy round of hands, a break is called. Bond places a tracking device in Le Chiffre's asthma inhaler and takes Vesper back to their room. Le Chiffre goes back to his room only to be confronted by Obanna and his henchman, demanding his money back. They threaten to cut off one of Le Chiffre's girlfriend's, Valenka's, arms, however, Le Chiffre doesn't acquiesce. Out in the hallway, Bond hears Valenka screaming. He quickly grabs Vesper and forces her to kiss him in the stairway entrance, however Obanna notices Bond's earpiece and attacks them both. The fight takes them down the stairwell to the bottom floor where Bond kills Obanna and his henchman. Bond sharply orders Vesper to contact Mathis, who sets up a man to take the fall for the dead bodies by placing them in the man's car trunk. The next day, during the continuing poker game, Bond loses all his money to Le Chiffre after misreading a bluff and admits to Vesper that he made a mistake. Vesper won't give him the buy back money saying he's going to lose it. Furious, 007 goes after Le Chiffre but is stopped by one of the other poker players, Felix Leiter, sent by the CIA to the poker match to catch Le Chiffre. Leiter tells 007 that he's doing poorly himself in the game and that he'll back Bond to re-enter the game; Leiter believes that Bond can beat Le Chiffre. In return, Bond will give Le Chiffre to the CIA. Bond slowly builds his bank again and once again becomes a threat to Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre has Valenka poinson Bond's martini with digitalis, causing Bond to suffer severe tachycardia. Bond goes to his car distressed and, communicating with medical specialists at MI6 headquarters, is about to use the defibrillator when he sees the the connection isn't plugged in and passes out. Vesper arrives, fixes the defib kit and shocks him back to life. Bond, shaken, returns to the game. The final hand of the game is down to four players, including Bond and Le Chiffre, who go ""all in"", betting their remaining money, driving the ""pot"" well over $150 million. Two are eliminated when their hands are called, leaving Le Chiffre and Bond. Le Chiffre reveals a straight flush. Bond reveals he has a higher straight flush and wins the game. Bond has dinner with Vesper, who receives a call from Mathis stating that Le Chiffre has been apprehended by the CIA. Vesper leaves the dining room; seconds later, Bond realizes she's in danger. Vesper is kidnapped by Le Chiffre. Bond races after them in his Aston Martin, but has to swerve violently when he sees Vesper lying bound in the road. The car rolls several times, destroying it and injuring Bond, rendering him unconscious. Le Chiffre and his cronies take him, remove his homing implant and take him and Vesper to a nearby tramp steamer. Bond is stripped and bound to a chair with the seat removed, leaving his testicles exposed. Le Chiffre uses a large knotted rope, striking Bond's scrotum, demanding the password for the account the winnings have been secured in. Bond refuses, despite Le Chiffre's threats to kill him and Vesper. Le Chiffre finally draws a knife and is about to castrate Bond when gunshots are heard outside. The door opens and Mr. White, broker from the first scene with Obanna, walks in. Le Chiffre pleads with him, saying he'll secure the money, to which White replies, ""Money isn't as important to our organization as knowing who to trust."" White shoots Le Chiffre in the forehead, killing him. Bond wakes up in a hospital bed during a haze while he recovers. He talks to Mathis, whom he believes was responsible for his and Vesper's capture by Le Chiffre. MI6 agents appear, taze Mathis and drag him away. Vesper visits Bond and they confess their love for each other. The Swiss banker in charge of the winnings account visits and Bond gives Vesper the password to key in; the password is her own first name. Bond resigns from the service to go away with Vesper, and they sail to Venice, Italy where Vesper says she'll get the money and Bond will get the supplies for the trip. When M phones 007 about his resignation, she says that they need to talk about the money being returned to the British government first, which tips off 007 that Vesper was using him all along. 007 follows Vesper to a secret meeting where she turns the money over, in cash, to a man named Gettler. Gettler and a few of his men retreat to a building being renovated and a gunfight ensues. Bond shoots and ruptures the flotation bags that hold the building above water-level and fights with them all, killing them. He tries to save Vesper, locked in an old elevator, but is unable to after she commits suicide by drowning herself. Bond recovers her body and takes her above water but is unable to revive her. Mr. White, who'd been watching the scene, is seen leaving with the suitcase full of money. Sitting on the sailboat he and Vesper had been vacationing on, Bond talks to M, who informs him that Vesper had a boyfriend who was being held by Le Chiffre's organization. She had intended to pay off Le Chiffre's associates with the money to secure her boyfriend's release. M believes that there are no further leads, that the ""trail has gone cold."" Bond examines Vesper's cell phone and finds the phone number of Mr. White. At Lake Como in Northern Italy, White arrives at a palatial estate. After he exits his car, he receives a phone call from someone telling him they ""need to talk."" Asking who the caller is, White is suddenly shot in the leg by a sniper. He falls to the ground and crawls toward the house. As he tries to climb the stairs and the familiar Bond theme begins to play, Bond appears carrying a cell phone and an HK rifle. As White looks up defiantly, Bond says ""The name's Bond. James Bond."" The closing titles roll immediately.",positive

I thought I had a difficult time letting people in my life until I met the beginning of 007. True love can change the hardest of hearts. This is where it all began. AWESOME FIGHT SCENES! Awesome opening.,positive
the best bond film since connery,positive
"based on the 1967 original film, Daniel Craig stars as the new James Bond. the story for this film if you don`t know is about James Bond's first 007 mission takes him to Madagascar, where he is to spy on a terrorist Mollaka. Not everything goes as planned and Bond decides to investigate, independently of the MI6 agency, in order to track down the rest of the terrorist cell. Following a lead to the Bahamas, he encounters Dimitrios and his girlfriend, Solange. He learns that Dimitrios is involved with Le Chiffre, banker to the world's terrorist organizations. i never would of guest that Daniel Craig would of been the new James Bond. the thing what spoils this film is that it doesn`t have the gadgets which had them in the other james bond fims. casino royale shouldn`t be a 12 i reckon it should be a 15. great acting, special affects and a high-stakes poker game at Casino Royale in Montenegro. a great 21st Bond film. can't wait for next James Bond film : The Quantum of Solace.",positive
This was a great re-boot of the James Bond franchise!! It was very real and gritty. The action and story were impressive! Daniel Craig made a great Bond and Eva Green was a great addition to the bond girls! I can't wait to see the sequel Quantum of Solace!,positive
"Fight terrorism by playing poker instead of, you know, killing them.",negative
"The name is bland, james bland...not! Shut the critics up.",positive
"Great action and story with major rewatch value to figure out just who is who. I liked that the movie was about Bond becoming Bond and not until the very end when he trusts no one does the theme song play and he intorduces himself as ""Bond, James Bond.""",positive
"I have always loved James Bond but holy moley, this is the first one to challenge Sean Connery - Daniel Craig is tightly wound the ENTIRE MOVIE so slightly exhausting to watch but he's SO good at this.",positive
Can't wait for the sequel!,positive
"Well crafted movie with some wonderful character scenes, esecially Bond and Vespers 1st meeting. The dialogue between those 2 crackles. Many of the ideas is what i whould write 4 a bond film. Martin Campbell conjours some cracking action also. t has taken me a while 2 get round to Daniel Craig as Bond, but the point of the film is he is not the suave James Bond yet. This is his personal journey 2 that. Just like the title song, 'you know my name' dares you to look at Bond in a new light.",positive
I loved this movie - thought he was the best bond in my era!,positive
"A great Bond movie, Although the movie slowed down in the middle right when he met Vesper Lynd. But it sped back up for the finale which was great.",positive
"Daniel Craig is James Bond.. nuff' said. Well except that there's so much to commend in this movie. It's due to Martin Campbell's sure directing that the there is a strong core to the story aside from the expected action set-pieces. In fact, it's the quieter indoor scenes that really shine. This is a Bond movie where you truly care about its characters.. especially for Bond himself. Eva Green's portrayal gives her Vesper character both confidence and weaknesses, making for a formidable and interesting female lead to challenge the likes of Bond. Full marks to Craig for portraying a flawed Bond, learning on the job, and finally going through an arc in his character's transformation that is convincing. This one sets the bar for future Bond movies.",positive
"To be honest I was more than sceptical towards Daniel Craig. Nevertheless this movie is breathtaking. Breathtaking but.... not unique. It is AGAIN a remake of the 67 version, but for once I will admit that the remake is better than the original. Come on get out of here! Peter Sellers alias James Bond? James is supposed to make you loose your manners during his famous introduction (My name is Bond - James Bond) not lose your serious! Anyway, I was surprised but one can grow warm towards this new Bond type which is a player and a casanova but which lacks the British manners and ""savoir-vivre"" which made Sir Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan hot as hell!",positive
The best Bond movie I've seen. Can't wait for the next one.,positive
esperando la nueva en noviembre haha,positive
"Though I grew up with Pierce Brosnan 007, I kind of like Daniel Craig's Bond. This is actually the first James Bond movie I enjoyed, and it's because of Vesper Lynd. (Eva Green is by far the ONLY woman I would turn lesbian for. SEXY!) She + Bond = lots of witty banter and she's the only woman who ever ""owned"" James Bond. Awesome.",positive
not the worst movie ever but the worst bond movie of all time. where is 007's sharp intellect and debonair. ratingdrops because of its comparisons with other bond movies and daniel craig compared to other bonds,negative
Possibly the best Bond movie ever... A top movie by itself as well... Martin Campbell did such a fine job.. Craig is brilliant as Bond.. This movie has restored the franchise and given it a new style...,positive
yep hands down my favorite bond yet i really hope they do another follow up that can compete,positive
"This was my first James Bond movie. It blew me away. Considering that all I've ever heard was that Sean Connery was the 'real' Bond, I have to say that Daniel Craig did a damn good job.",positive
Excelent performance by Daniel Craig. It is a really refreshing new take on the series.,positive
"In my opinon this is the best Bond movie to date- though I have a soft spot for ""From Russia With Love"", ""Goldfinger"", and ""GoldenEye"" (and I still think that that's the best Bond video game, btw). I've seen almost all of the James Bond movies- minus a couple of the Roger Moore ones- he's probably my least favorite Bond. According to what I've read, this movie stays truer to the novel that it is based on. More power to it! I like this new direction, so sue me, ok? I have nothing against cheesy fun, but don't knock it when something with a little more depth comes along.",positive
Daniel Craig definitely holds his own as Bond. The movie was packed with action and great moments. Congrats to Martin Campbell on the last line of the movie!,positive
Daneil craig (from Chester) is a brilliant Bond better thean Brosman. Great Film!,positive
"Daniel Craig's reinvention of Bond is one of the most fun films to watch. After the utterly horrible ""Die Another Day"" (I hated it, it's the Batman & Robin of Bond films), I had no idea where they would turn once Pierce Brosnan stepped down. Also a lot of people didn't care for Craig at first, but once you sit down and watch the film, I have to say he's the best Bond since Connery. Great plot too. Very interesting stuff going on. Also it's quite brutal for a Bond film and dark. That's always a plus.",positive
"My favorite bond movie. Love every minute of it, this bond has problems and is just more into character.",positive
A very good job by Craig to play as Bond. I've never been much of a fan of the series. Though this being the beginings I have to say I am now a fan. The darker approach and more mordernized weaponary is a plus too. That's what really turned me off about hte past films with all the futuristic stuff. A good love story too and I pray to God I never met a Vesper of my own. =),positive
"Daniel Craig Stars As The New 007 & Proves To Be Very Good At It In Casino Royale, Which Is Very Worth Watching. Excellent Performances And To Top It All Of A Excellent Movie!",positive

"Vaikka vanhat Bondit ovatkin legendaarisia, uskallan vÃ¤ittÃ¤Ã¤, ettÃ¤ tÃ¤ssÃ¤ Bondissa on sitÃ¤ jotain ja vÃ¤hÃ¤n enemmÃ¤nkin.

Daniel Craigissa on munaa ja tÃ¤mÃ¤ elokuva on vihdoin tuonut Bondin uudelle vuosituhannelle niinkuin se kuuluu.",positive
Daniel Craig is arguably the best Bond ever!,negative
"I don't care what the critics and moviegoers say - this is one of the best Bond movies in the while. Craig has captured the naked violence and sheer, raw physical action quite well.",positive
Best Bond in years.Go Craig!,positive
This and Goldeneye are tied for best bond flick ...in my eyes atleast.,positive
James Bond is a boss; crazy explosions + awesome action + some good lookin' women= one hellavu time. This movie is so good I can't wait till Quantum of Solace.,positive
"For all my love of action movies, I've never been a huge James Bond fan - a little too contrived, a little too ridiculous, especially in the later years. But I'm hooked on this one.",positive
Liked the shift in Bond's overall demeanor and presence. Enjoyed it till the ending.,negative
"What a great Bond film! Who wouldn't fall in love with Vesper Lynd? Too bad, she dies...",positive
"I have never ever seen a James Bond movie before, and I never ever wanted to see a James Bond movie, but I was pretty much forced to go see this movie and surprisingly I liked it enough to be able to watch it a second time :). Pretty good movie, and I can't wait until the new one comes out.",positive
I loved it. I was there to buy my copy the day it came out. A GREAT file and high on my favorite's list.,positive
One of the best movies i've seen...Daniel Craig plays a fairly good bond but Pierce Brosnan is by far the best,positive
"This Bond film is different.I have mixed feeling on this.Soundtrack crap,Craig cool but no Pierce Brosnan,Good Action and Judi Dench should retire.",negative
I realize that James Bond is supposed to be some kind of pretty boy but this is too much. Barely a hero. In fact was was he? Dissappointment.,negative
One of the best James Bond movies.,positive
"Easily the best Bond film of the postmodern period. They intended to jump start the franchise, frankly one that had become a joke and they nailed it. The story is a little bloated at times, in particular the extensive focus on the poker. I almost feel as though they decided that in order to ensure they would draw a younger audience they included so much of the poker to capitalize on what was extremely popular at the time of the films release. The choice of Craig as Bond completely worked and I really appreciate the nods to both the earlier films and to the novels. There is a real connection to the novels, something really missing since Connery left the helm. The film is opulent and beautiful and ironically released at the right time. I'm not sure such an opulent film would go over as well in our current economic climate. Easily a top three Bond film for me, right behind Goldfinger and Thunderball.",positive
"I was a little concered about Daniel being Bond, like there was some sort of curse to the next guy who played Bond after a really good Bond. Sean Connery = Good Bond, George Lazenby =Bad Bond, Roger Moore = Good Bond, Timothy Dalton = Bad Bond, Pierce Bronson = Good Bond, Daniel Craig = Best Bond ever! This movie exceeded my expections and i am anticapating Quantum of Solace.",positive
"Since Connery, This is the best Bond film in many many years.",positive
"One of the best Bond movies I have ever seen. The opening chase scene was very thrilling with amazing stunt work. After all of the stuff being said about Daniel Craig being Bond, I thought he was really great. I re-watched this movie recently and enjoyed it as much as I did in the theater. Excellent job by Campbell on the direction.",positive
"I have to admit, I did not like this film the first time I watched it. I don't like how they've taken Bond back to the very begining. I wasn't too sure of Daniel Craig to begin with but after watching some of his other movies and watching this again, I must say he is the best actor, right now, to play James Bond. Its got all the usual action packed 007 style explosions, fights, tense moments, villans etc. I got a bit worried at the end when Bond said 'I love you' to Vespa",negative
As usual James bond was a big boy's wet dream (a man with a gun who wins all his battles & gets the ladies) except towards the end when it became more mushy than even I could handle. I loved the shots of Venice tho.,negative
"I don't care what certain people say, this is the definitive Bond film, and the best film in the series thus far. The character is the closest to Flemming's original since Dalton, as is the story, the villain is top notch, and I absolutely love the theme song and title sequence, despite it's lack of naked women. The only real problem is that when I first saw it, I thought the ending dragged on too long. But now I see that without that ending it would have lacked much closure, and it wouldn't have set up Quantum of Solace so well.",positive
Best James Bond film ive seen and a good revamp for a dwindling series.,positive
Congrats on the record for the number of rolls in a car crash (watch the special features on the DVD),negative
"I never really liked Pierce Brosnan, always pictured him as his character Remington Steele for the old TV show of the same name. This new Bond was a chance to like Bond movies again.",positive
Uh... Dialogue needed to be better. Losta stuff getting blown up though,negative
One of my fav Bond movies!,positive
I like all James Bond films but I think this one was in the top 3 Bond films of all time.,positive
"Very long, but entertaining to watch. Don't know if I could sit though it again, but I liked it.",positive
"one of the best bond films truly good, im glad he upgraded from that ppk to the great p99 pistol.",positive
"Bond is back at last - real sunts and stunning ones at that! Great story, well acted and fantastic visuals...",positive
great secret agent film. horrible james bond film. i'm sorry but you can't just change most aspects of a character and still give him the same name :S,negative
"Its a bit long, but a great movie",positive
"Although this film is close up there with Goldfinger, I think this is the BEST Bond movie of the series. Daniel Craig is astounding in the role and the movie is more down to earth and less cheesy.",positive
"Le seul James Bond que j'ai vu au cinema. Etant un inconditionnel de Sean Connery, les autres etant des clowns, j'ai ete bluffe par daniel Craig. Le meilleur film de la serie selon moi.",negative
Poker? Why poker? I thought James Bond was a gentleman? Love the anachronism though,negative
Pretty good movie. Fair amount of action and chase scenes. It always kept you guessing and had some twists and turns I didn't expect.,negative
"Things dipped in the third quarter, but overall a satisfactory and just-complex-enough affair. Marry me, Judi.",negative
"The best bond movie in my opinion, and I've watched almost all of them. Things are much faster paced and the plot is certainly a tad deeper than the usually 007 affairs. Very satisfying to watch, again and again.",positive
"When I first saw this movie a couple of years ago I was entertained. It did not hold my interest as much as a Bond movie starring Connery, Moore, or Brosnan, but I thought the film had some nice action sequences and nice scenery. Now my aunt was visiting today and she had never seen the movie, although she is an avid Bond fan. So we decided to pop in the DVD. The only thing I could think of was ""How could I have liked this movie before?"" I thought there was a handful non sequitur moments whenever Bond would piece together something. And its not like I didn't understand the story and that there loose ends, its that many times there was no way for him in those situations to come up with those conclusions himself; its as if the character has seen the movie before. The relationship between Bond and the girl suddenly becomes undying passionate love after they are freed from the torture rooms. Bond's main mission was to win a poker game??? Honestly I don't know how I didn't see this the first time. The thing that perplexed me the most though was reading the rave reviews this movie had on this and other sites. Its easier to understand these considering they were made when the movie first came out, but I am wondering have people seen this movie for what it really was after seeing it a second or third time? I understand this movie was kind of a remake (""kind of"" because the original was more of a comedy if anything) so I don't fault this movie with what I've come to see as a silly main plot. But after the original mini mission of stopping the plane from blowing up, there was no actual espionage! I guess there should be a little concession that I had just seen the Dark Knight earlier today (for the second time) and that by comparison this wasn't even close to measuring up. But even when I saw it two years ago I never even considered this a Bond movie, whether it was because of the actor or the script I don't really know or care.",negative
"Similar to Batman and Superman (and Star Trek, soon), Bond was in need of a rebirth and Casino Royale delivered. Craig is excellent as 007 and quickly shut up the critics who poo-pooed when he was chosen. The opening parkour sequence is one of the best pre-credit openings of any Bond movie made.",positive
"Best Bond movie ever, and that's saying a lot.",positive
This is the first one I have seen and I loved it! Daniel Craig is a great actor and I loved the story and the poker scenes were really interesting...I can't wait for the next one to come out :),positive
"Daniel Craig was actually a pretty decent Bond (not up to Sean Connery's standards, but still a good replacement for PB). This movie was not as outrageous and over-the-top as the last few bond movies, but still it was entertaining.",negative
Interesting jumpstart of the 007 series. It will be even more interesting to see where they go from here.,positive
THis was good!! I thought the plot was good kinda sad at the end but i'm sure it's going to make into a great sequel!!!,positive
And he lived to walk away. The boys must have cringed when they saw his nuts being whapped. Ow!,positive
brilliant..craig did the franchise proud..,negative
"[font=Arial Black]I'm going to admit firstly that when this film came out, i was a criag hater - and hell it taught me never to judge something before you have witnessed/done/seen it.[/font] [font=Arial Black]A brilliant decent from the indestuctable thousands of bullets that would consistently miss bond. With emphasised sound on shooting and little shooting scenes in this film, its puts a urgently needed stealth that gives the new franchise a breath of fresh air. Although it breaks this many a time as it shows that a good shootup is needed (i refer to the first gun fight on the African embassy). In order to give your average joe a good film.[/font] [font=Arial Black]Whether the director still kept gun fights due to the the preceding films (which showed many gunfights) it can be suggested that such a change with little or no shooting would be too drastic. The point i make is that he will have to shock audiences in some way to play a greater film - and sometime the story alone cannot do this.[/font] [font=Arial Black]Brilliant acting by Craig to which i am thankful for and which should hopefully bring on new type of bond that i would watch forever.[/font] [font=Arial Black]Lastly, a remarkably good film for a brilliant Bond that greatly deserves all of its compliments. A masterpiece.[/font]",positive
This being my very first James Bond movie EVER I really didn't expect it to be so damn awesome!!!!,positive
"Paras Bond, tosin ei tuntunut Bondilta juuri lainkaan...",positive
made a change to see Bond not always win,negative
"The opening black and white scene is a great way to grab the audience's attention and keep it with flashback fight scenes. The title sequence is fantastically animated and planned out, complete with a great song. The chase in the beginning is a little too long drawn out but ends well. This movie is long but worth the watch, a necessary prequel to the Bond series that will define an age in film. I would've loved to see more Jeffrey Wright and his story is left incomplete, but the addition of his character at all was great. Bond is portrayed having emotions, which is definatley a first for the hero. And we later see how he loses those emotions through a good ending action/tragedy scene in the end. Bond's humor is at a high. Daniel Craig and Judi Dench are a great love/hate pair as Bond and M, but I was hoping to see some of Q. A",positive
"It's the Bond we all know and love, but with less outrageous gadgets and more realistic spywork.",positive
"""Casino Royale"" is a terrific film, blisteringly entertaining, and made with great style. I've only seen parts of a few other James Bond films (a couple with Roger Moore and one of the Pierce Brosnan entries), neither of which I particularly liked enough to even finish. I have read several of the original Ian Fleming novels, though, and this new Bond pays great homage to them. Like ""Batman Begins"" (and, to a certain extent, ""Superman Returns""), this new Bond film starts the series over, essentially ignoring everything that had come before. This is a good thing because the series was getting a little long in the tooth and had deviated completely from its original concept. My problem with the previous series of films was that they were so campy, so inappropriately tongue-in-cheek, nothing at all like the lean, muscular prose that Fleming used. The original films (at least the ones I actually saw) had become (narratively- and cinematically-speaking) fat and flabby, existing mostly on the fumes of nostalgia. The new ""Casino Royale,"" though, is pure cinema--light on dialogue, heavy on action, and yet populated with reasonably complex characters whose motivations aren't quite so black and white. Hitchcock would have been proud.",positive
How James Bond should be! Hardass!,positive
best Bond movie since 'You only Live Twice'.,positive
"It's good, but not as good as everyone makes it out to be. The action scenes work well, but do feel a tad bit outrageous and forced at times (see the opening scene). The only real problem I have with the film is that its slightly confusing due to the high number of villains which go unexplained really. Also, too much time is spent just watching them play cards. But these are indeed somewhat minor criticisms of an overall decent flick. Its certainly one of the better Bond films, but I wouldn't say its the best.",positive
"Great movie. It feels as though its a bit long, but all parts of the plot had to be included for it to be good.",positive
"Finally, I have the Bond I have been waiting on. No offense to the immortal Sean Connery, but this is MY James Bond. A wonderful update on the secret agent man, this a tougher, grittier Bond who paradoxically bleeds and has accessible feelings which come out in unexpected ways, particularly a terrific shower scene (never thought I'd see that). Plot and cast are top-notch. Eva Green is the best Bond girl I have encountered (she actually has...gasp...a brain to match the beauty) and she's more than a match for 007. As a bonus Judi Dench is finally unleashed as M after being held back in previous efforts. It's hard to imagine the next one can be any better.",positive
"Craig gets a lot of flack for being Bond, but I really like him. This take on the more violent, fast-paced Bond is great. The old pretty boy, never-gets-his-hands-dirty Bond had to go. I welcome this new Bond. Excellent role.",positive
that last hand almost killed me.,positive
"Sean Connery- smooth. Roger Moore- suave and funny. George Laznby- had the moves and the cleft devil's chin. Timothy Dalton- looked like the devil and was edgy. Pierce Brosnan- looked like a suit tailor's mannequin and looked like Bond til he opened his mouth and garbled embarassingly shiteous dialogue (for his real Bond performance watch Thomas Crown where he IS Bond). Daniel Craig? Looks like Ed Harris's (much) older brother. The kinda guy you'd expect to see going through your trash on the street. Begging for change on Santa Monica promenade.Smelling up a soup kitchen. Sat at the end of the drive thru at McDonald's hoping for a spare cheeseburger (in between abs crunches- certainly the most toned homeless dude anyway). The kinda guy who'd be drinking by himself in a dive bar, stumbling round groping your woman's boobies and getting bottled by nuns for being so offensively hideous. It's not all his fault. The man can act (I think) but suave, smart and BOND he is not. I don't blame him. He probably booked himself into a top hotel suite with all the hookers and coke he could get his hands on once he heard he'd had the good fortune of getting the Bond gig. Hey, wouldn't you go have a blast with your cash advance thinking if you spent it before they realized they'd cast the wrong person you might not have to give it back? Please, for the love of the franchise, fire the writers of the last five movies. They suck more cocks than a Vegas showgirl. They have raped the franchise, stripped it, lubed it up and violated it with rolled up copies of their shiteous verbiage. Please set Daniel Craig on them in their offices to beat them senseless as he does in the movies (then pout gratuitously for the camera before ripping his shirt off to convince the ladies he is actually hot). Just imagine seeing Daniel's body pics on myspace BEFORE seeing his face pics. Sure there'd be alot of disappointment going from the abs to the face. Iif possible, please give Daniel some charisma and pull the producers' heads out of their arses and bring the fucking FUN and entertaining elements back to the franchise. If you want to reboot the series, fire the talentless hack writers and get John McTiernan/Luc Besson to direct. Or better yet, an R-rated Paul Verhoeven version. As for the movie itself. A car ""chase"" where Bond drives round ONE corner and crashes? Bullshit. Bond telling a chick he met a week ago ""I love you."" Utter bollocks. A vaguely vomit inducing Danish bloke with a manky eye that weeps blood is our big villain- oh and he's so good at being the bad guy and the writers are so clever in not using him AT ALL throughout the movie that he is shot by a lesser villain half an hour before the move ends? WANKAGE. Also, can we have a notable psychiatrist treat this movie's schizophrenia? On one side it wants to outdo the Bourne films (failing miserably to do so) by trying to be realistic, gritty and down to earth. Then suddenly you have buildings collapsing on Venice canals, Bond jumping ut of speeding trucks, airports being attacked and running up cranes. Utter and complete mind twisting scrotum pounding hypocritical indescisiveness. Bond doesn't steal from other franchises. He sets the bar. The crap writers wrote the franshise into a hole and almost out of the multiplex completely with camp-a-thon DIE ANOTHER DAY (though they had the good sense to include Halle's berries). Fire them and bring back John Glen for the love of god.",negative
Watched this on a tiny PSP so I might have enjoyed it more if I had seen it on a bigger screen with better sound. This is the best Bond movie yet for sure. A game of poker and the use of a defibrillator provided more excitement than most action movies. Less is always more! And what an opening chase scene!,positive
This was a really good film action packed all the way through 10/10.,positive
Daniel Craig is awesome as 007. Intense and more believable than some of the Bond movies. Good to see James Bond cool and bad ass again!,positive
"typical james bond movie, the car, the gadgets, all the bits you love...the casino bit wasnt very interesting, but overall it was fun to watch",negative
"This is definitely the best Bond movie I've ever seen and if I was a fan of Bond I would have given this a higher rating. Good stuff: This is in the real world. There are no invisible cars and watches that do 5000 different things. There is cool technology, nice cars etc but its more real. The fights are more realistic too. Bond does not parachute out of a car while driving off a cliff or anything. He gets dirty and is bested on a few occasions. I loved the opening chase where he was after a guy who clearly was one of those urban jumper guys and Bond couldn't repeat his mad jumps and had to find other ways to keep up. Bond is tortured and gets cut, shot and poisoned. He's tough but breakable. The character of Bond is interesting in this one. He is a callous bastard really and comes on to a suspect's wife for information only. Old Bond would have shagged her anyway and then left. This bond just leaves her waiting. Romance does bloom later and it does give the later sections an urgency. Daniel Craig is physically different (not comforable in a suit at first, built like a brick shithouse and with cold steely eyes). Bond, and the film in general, is very masculine, with none of the campness of previous outings. He doesn't give a crap whether his martini is shaken or stirred. The one liners do not trip off his tongue. He is serious, damaged and interesting to watch. Bad stuff: Despite his performance being way beyond any other bond I've seen I still found it hard to get into the interior life of the character. He is so impassive. Is he nervous about the big card game? The declarations of love are a bit unconvincing when they do come. He's hard and detached, and that is maybe the point, but then it makes him hard to care about. The women are stunning, but in the shrieking maiden in distress / femme fatale mode. Bond is a bit misoginist of course and I find it a bit off putting. The plot was my major problem though. It just kind of meanders. There is no clear idea of what his mission is until he discovers it step by step and just when you think its over, its not. I felt the plot could have been set up more clearly to start with as we were over half way through and I was still waiting for his mission to start. Overall though a quality movie.",negative
"Never really a fan of James Bond I have to say this turned me around, its very good.",negative
"Bond is back.... He blond, is shit at poker but can take a kick in the balls like a real man.",positive
"Didn't re-invent anything, merely segued for a moment. This was a brilliant opportunity to extract the cheese from 007 but it ended up placing him back in the very mould this film was meant to be braking. Best Bond film in a while, sure, but could've been SO much better it hurts.",negative
Daniel Craig is by far the best James Bond. He is charismatic the way Sean Connery was when he was 007. Great action. I'm looking forward to many more great Bond films to come!,positive
"There's a dirty secret when it comes to James Bond movies: they all suck. Every single one of them, and we're including the ones starring Sean Connery, who's made more out of less (his accent and bristly but cultured masculinity) than any actor I can think of. They all stank, like rot. Until this one. To begin with, it's not poorly lit, poorly shot, with lethargic ""action"" sequences involving cheap explosions and poorly choreographed fight scenes. The lovable institution of ""Q"" (always beware of ""lovable institutions"") has been dispatched entirely, as have cartoonish demonstrations of ""cultured living"" that would appeal only to those with no conception of what ""cultured"" and ""high class"" actually consist of. (Hint: it has nothing to do with ordering drinks shaken and not stirred, or enjoying Peruvian Blonde coffee from the first beans of the season.) James Bond movies have always appealed to a certain demographic. At least in the US, that was predominantly young, male, and incredibly dumb. Female characters--even the allegedly ""strong"" ones--were always soft in the head and punished for any semblance of mental fortitude with unapologetically mysogynistic names like Pussy Galore. (So much for ""strong female characters"", it's no wonder that being a ""Bond Girl"" is an insult to any serious working actor.) Daniel Craig is a wonder--physically compact and powerful, he's like watching a coiled spring move about the stage. Eva Green, however, is the real standout. Her Vesper Lynd falls for none of Bond's pat lines and surface charms, and is just as bright and quick as he is: his initial attempt to establish the alpha-male position in their relationship is quickly upended entirely, with a sharp riposte that set the tone for the rest of the movie. Given this latest turn in the franchise, and its rightful place as The Only Good Bond Movie Ever Made, I wait with no small anticipation for the latest release, Quantum Solace.",positive
This Bond film doesn't become interesting until the last quarter of the narrative and I can't quite buy into Daniel Craig as the James Bond character.,negative
"He's not Sean Connery, but he's good. He has his own mark on 007 and makes me glad that they are making another.",positive

I was pissed off when I first learned that Mr. Brosnan wouldn't be joining us on this most recent Bond adventure. I've got ot admit though, I like this new guy. Casino Royale took an entirely 21st century approach on Bond. Very gritty, violent, ction-packed and yet still retaining the cool, stylish elements that make any Bond movie what they are.",positive
Daniel Craig is soo hot. The best James Bond movie ever.,positive
Daniel Craig is 007 he is going to do a good job really want to see the next film now,positive
Don't drink a lot before you watch this movie. There are things that will frighten you suddenly without notice and the action is the best of the Bond films. Raw! Intense! Bond!,positive
One of the best movies I have ever seen!,positive
Best Bond film since Goldeneye.,positive
I have no more doubts about Daniel Craig playing the role of James Bond. Casino Royale brings the James Bond movies new life.,positive
love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"What a film...All the other Bonds just seem cheesy and unrealistic. This is fantastic. He gets beaten up, nearly dies (thats a first) and just generally has a rough time. And also has time to play a game of poker...",positive
"Best Bond movie ever made. They took the story back to the start, replaced Brosnan and made Bond cooler than ever.Should have done all that after the last decent Bond movie - Goldeneye.",positive
Quite possibly the best bond film ever!!!,positive
It's pretty boring for a James Bond movie. Most of it consists of him playing Poker. And having Bond fall in love is a joke. James Bond is a womanizing chauvinistic pig. The opening is pretty good however with a great chase sequence. The end almost makes up for that terrible middle.,negative
pucha no me gustan las de accion pero daniel craig otra cosa xd,negative
The way Bond should be.,positive
"Weak. James Bond has been neutered. This could have been so much better! They took the naked ladies out of the opening credits! What's next, is he going to start cuddling afterward?",negative
"Daniel Craig, I believe is my favorite Bond thus far. The original, aside...you can't beat the original, but he's second best. This movie was very good, but it lacked a lot of action scenes, and the ending kind of sucked. Nonetheless, a great movie!",positive
I don't really usually enjoy James Bond movies but this one was so great!,positive
my favourite bond movie,positive
I enjoyed this daniel craig as james bond and he did good in poker. Pierce Brosnan was missed.,positive
"James Bond , does NOT HAVE SHORT BLOND HAIR !!! Craig Is the worst Person for The Role Of James Bond !!!",negative
One of the best Bond movies,positive
Love James Bond Movies!! Daniel Craig :),positive
Il peggior 007 di sempre! The worst 007 ever!,negative
"Very good Bond movie, second only to the latest. They make a nice 2/3 of a trilogy together.",negative
Eva Green. Wow. Daniel Craig made Bond serious again. Really liked this film. Looking forward to the next Craig/Bond flick.,positive
did almost fall asleep during this. guess i like more the old school bond.,negative
"Siento reiterar, pero de todos los James Bond que ha habido, el que mÃ¡s me ha transportado al mundo de los espias ha sido este. No es el mÃ¡s guapo, pero sÃ­ el mas creible.",positive
"I feel Daniel Craig is too much of a macho man in this 007 film. Hopefully in ""Quantum of Solace"" we see a more elegant, posh, sophisticated Bond.",negative
daniel craig isn't my kind of james bond,negative
"Not being inclined to watch movies more than once, this movie is suburb: action packed, gadgets, emotions, love story in the middle, action again and a character statement at the end.",positive
It was alright! I like old bond better!,negative
amazing revival of the series,positive
I'm not a fan of 007 but I really liked this movie. A very stylish crime thriller with a surprisingly refreshing performance by Daniel Craig.,positive
haha i saw it on an airplane..and oi like it,negative
i think this is one of the best bond movies,positive
best bond movie ever. daniel craig is the best bond ever. i'm glad bond isn't a walking punchline anymore and actually looks like he could kick someone's ass.,positive
"Loved the first 2 acts. As soon as Bond is strapped to the chair, we were both in for a bit of torture.",negative
CAn't wait for the next one,positive
"Connery may be the best Bond, but this is the best Bond film! Amazing action sequences, a plot that will keep you guessing and a leading lady who actually melts Bond's icy heart. All done in a realistically gritty manner.",positive
"Saw this again, 2 years later. Best Bond movie EVAAAH !",positive
"Daniel Craig blows fuck Pierce Brosne out the fuckin water. This is my 2nd favorite Bond movie of all time. You know what, I can't say that because this movie was just awesome and is tied with my favorite. haha! This is a must see.",positive
"HES THE BEST BOND EVER, ACTION FROM BEGINNING TO END",positive
"Just saw it again, and while I have seen many other Bond movies to compare it too, I thought it was fantastic!!!",positive
Not bad. I enjoyed this one. A bit long though,negative
Daniel Craig kicks so much ass!,positive
"Loved the parcour sequence (beginning, Madagascar) and really liked Daniel Craig BUT I thought it was way too long and I kind off signed off in that Casino in Montenegro....",negative
It was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
Craig shall go to hell...,negative
"Simply brilliant. Quite possibly the best Bond film ever made. Daniel Craig delivers a gritty, rugged performance as we go back to the beginning of his 007 career. The action scenes are awesome and there are nail-biting moments aplenty. More of the same with the next one please",positive

Well what can I say...Daniel Craig's in it so that's all that matters!!!! Fab film too.,positive
"Totally revises Bond in a more than sex, action, and gadgets way.",positive
Craig brings back the Connery Bond - this isn't some wimpy version of Bond - he's a bad ass. The only bad moments are car related - watching Bond drive a Ford? And watching him wreck a Aston Martin DBS.,positive
"Just saw this again. Undoubtedly one of the best Bonds. Love that they've lost the lame jokes and gimmicks, love the toughness (torture, yeah) and love Daniel Craig, especially in a bathing suit. Can't wait for Quantum of Solace this winter!",positive
"This was pretty good, but I fell asleep in the middle of it so I'm pretty sure I missed a lot. Daniel Craig is pretty bad ass though.",negative
good movie. It had some good fight scenes in it. I was just confused a bit on some parts. hmm.,positive
Easily the best bond to date! Casino Royale is packed with heart pounding action and a great story line! Not to mentions craigs excellent performance as bond! I couldnt of asked for anyone better.,positive
"Pretty cool movie, not as good as the others. All the chicks were hot...",positive
One of my favorite Bond movies for sure!,positive
Daniel Craig.. that's all I've got to say <3,positive
"Not sure if i have reviewed this movie or not, but upon revisiting this amazing movie i thought i would give it 5 big stars, what a great movie. very excited about the next one coming in October i believe. Any way great movie!!",positive

"Para mi gusto este Daniel Craig si llena el traje de James Bond. Una pelicula mas ruda que las anteriores, pero vale la pena.",positive
"Dur de reprendre un rÃ´le dans lequel il fait son premier film..MalgrÃ© tout, le film a Ã©tÃ© dÃ©cevant mais a eu un bon succÃ¨s par rapport Ã  la qualitÃ© de ce film. A continuer dans ce sens pour redevenir un mythe..",negative
"I hated this, just didnt feel like a Bond film to me, also was begging for it to end before the last 30 minutes as it felt really dragged out.",negative
"The movie jumped right into a chase scene and Bond was on the go, after some bad guy who was running across a construction site a-la ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" Then there was a bad guy and some sexy ladies and zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz... Yeah, that's me wishing I was snoring. I had never seen a Bond movie in my life and have no interest in seeing another. The acting was fine and I'm sure the story was pleasing to Bond fans who want to stay in the feel that genre has established. But, I just walked away saying, ""Yawn."" Actually, I spent the last hour of the 150 minute saga flipping through far more interesting fashion magazines. But, I was glad to see my husband enjoying it. (July 2008).",negative

"It was fair. Not great, but not terrible. It would have been much improved by trimming the poker game that never seemed to end.",negative
I loved this movie so much! My boyfriend looks like James Bond!!,positive
The best Bond movie ever made!,positive
"I must say, I have not seen all the 007 films, but what modern ones I HAVE seen (with Pierce Brosnan), this one tops the cake.",positive
"I never really got into the James Bond franchise overall. But this is a great movie. It irked me that people knocked Daniel Craig before the movie even came out...and for the most part because of his hair color!?! Well he laughed all the way to th...(read more) e bank! Mads Mikkelsen is freaky as the villain with the bleeding eye. Another excellent performance from Eva Green, last seen in Kingdom of Heaven.",positive
"This movie was incredibly boring and disinteresting to me. Except for the opening scene involving parkour, the movie seems really pointless and disengaging. It was okay.",negative
"Gosh, I love the actions and stunts! Despite the acting and dialogues which I barely understand (me lamed, yes) or care, I enjoy this action-packed movie. and of course, who will say NO to Eva Green?",negative
best bond film. i was blown away.,positive
"a pretty good action movie but not really a good Bond movie. James Bond takes his martinis shaken, not stirred!",negative
Amazing! The best Bond movie ever.,positive
"The original was 10 times better, but still a good movie.",negative
best bond yet can't wait for the next,positive
this is a brilliant start to a new generation of 007 lovers. Daniel Craig is a whole new bad ass but I would like to see a little more comedic and quick mouthed character instead of violent driven,positive
This Bond is a cold hearted bastard who relies more on his skill and wits than on technological gadgets. Best Bond film in years.,positive
"After the dross that was the Brosnan Years (their fault, not his), this was an awesome comeback.",positive
"They certainly freshened Bond up in this movie, although haven't seen the Brosnan movies except for GoldenEye, this seems to bring a lot of new stuff to the old Bond francise. Let's hope the next one keeps uo the good work.",positive
"it was ok, not great but watchable",negative
"the best bond for over a decade, i was one of the only people who thought daniel craig would be ace as i saw him in layer cake beforehand.",positive
this bond film lived up to the old ones and i cant wait for the new one,positive
Not a great Bond fan but this definitely worth the look.,negative
Cool! But no as cool as Bourne.,positive
"incredible action, and i will remeber this film for a long time, the only problem with this movie is that there is too many poker scenes",positive

best bond flick since a view to a kill..,positive
"Liked Daniel Craig as more of a rougher Bond, but the movie was a bit strung out with not enough explosions and cool gadgets.",negative
"The grittier and slightly less ridiculous 007 can't make up for one of the dullest plots in the entire franchise. Some top-notch action scenes though, but the best ones are first and worst ones are last. Very disappointing.",negative
This is a movie that I could watch over and over again,positive
"Best bond film ever. Great action, great character...",positive
Best Bond film. Simple as that. Hard as nails and very British. Would give Jason Bourne a run for his money. I wonder if that Jason was the reason behind the rebirth of the new Bond. Lets face it JB had gotten a little soft around the gut! Very good Bond flick but does drag on a bit in the middle as others have said.,positive
This is probably my 2nd favorite Bond film after Goldeneye. Just a well put together film with good performances from Daniel Craig and Eva Green and Judi Dench. Good action and why not its a James Bond film.,positive
i dont miss pirce brosnna,positive
Best reinvention of a series I've seen.,positive
"Extremely well written, acted and directed. The action is both fresh and exciting, the acting from Craig is flawless.",positive
Great restart of the franchise. Craig did well in filling big shoes.,positive
This bond how it should be. Gritty.,positive
The blond Bond is here to stay!,positive
pobably the ONLY Bond flick i will ever like.,negative
Craig spielt echt toll. Wieder mal ein harter Bond ;),positive
best bond so far :) and best looking mmmmmmmm,positive
The best bond movie i've seen so far,positive
"This movie stole my breath away. The first action scene blew me to pieces: the stunts, the chases, the shooting, the action, I mean, wow! Daniel Craig steps it up, proving that his James Bond truly is a great assassin/superspy that Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, or anyone else could ever be.",positive
brilliant if u love poker,positive
"I like Bond movies and always have, but this one just isn't it. What a lame and non-cohesive plot. Daniel Craig is doing an all-right job I guess.",negative
My first Bond flick. Ever. And I liked Daniel Craig. I enjoyed it.,negative
daniel craig makes a great bond. i can't wait for the quantom solace,positive
"My favorite Bond film so far. Daniel Craig is no Sean Connery, but he's the next best thing, for sure. Craig is a badass and plays a very different Bond than the one we're used to seeing.",positive
From the start till the end a great movie can't wait for Quatum of Solace,positive
daniel craig is majorly sexy :),positive
"More product placement than MTV - Daniel Craig brings life into a worn out character but the lack of an intrestng story line just brings this down to a boreing movie with some eye candy for both sexes in it. This bond also makes no sence. If this is his first misson why is there a female ""M"" ??? and full with modern day gadgets. And were is ""Q"" (OK the real guy is dead I know this but still)",negative

I was suprised to like the new blond bond. he's dirtier and meaner than past bonds. I liked it.,negative
"Mi ha convinto poco questo Bond, non tanto per Craig, ma proprio a livello di trama. La parte finale l'avrei totalmente eliminata: cosa si son messi lÃ¬ a spiegare (male) un aspetto della storia, che poi viene lasciato a metÃ ... ma sono matti? Al contrario le scene d'azione mi sono piaciute, ed ecco perchÃ©, nonostante tutti, il film raggiunge la sufficienza nel mio tabellino.",negative
"A great actor, superb film. Quality",positive
"Daniel Craig's Bond is a relieving step forward from every non-Goldeneye Brosnan Bond. However, he doesn't manage to capture the charm that many of the other Bonds did. The movie is darker, and thankfully without an array of hokey gadgets, but it doesn't feel like a Bond film so much as it feels like a decent action blockbuster.",negative
"One of the most amazing movies ever, and definitely the best bond film",positive
"Ya know, Everyone made such a hype about him being blonde, but in the original James bond novels, he was blonde with blue eyes. So there. I love him as James bond, I also loved Sean Connery",positive
"Bond is back! Daniel Craig plays Bond with an edge and a cool menace not seen before. Even the Master, Connery, focused more on the panache. The story line has a sharper edgee to it as well. I can't wait until Quantum of Solace comes out in November.",positive
"Bond is back! This revitalization of the franchise boasts a fascinating and well-written storyline, heart-pounding action sequences and solid performances across the boards. Most crucially, it has Daniel Craig making a powerful debut as 007 and proving that he is probably the best actor to assume the role since Sean Connery. Craig delves into the darker and lonelier aspects of the Bond persona and also gives us a sense of how an orphaned street thug gradually developed into Britain's most debonair secret agent. The result is the most human portrayal of Bond EVER and the assurance that the series will not be reducing Bond to a Roger Moore-like cartoon character any time soon. Eva Green also deserves a great deal of credit for making Vesper Lynn a believable and multi-faceted love interest for Bond and not just another one-dimensional sex pot.",positive
"Much better than the previous and the crap it contained. Invisible cars, come on! I don't like Craig much for the role (James Blond, as I like to call him), but he did a decent job.",negative
bond as he should be...beating the shit outta dudes and taking names,negative
"BEST BOND EVER! Gone is the camp, the goofiness, and the over-stylized sexism and suaveness that is crucial to Bond's character. He's still a womanizer and suave and cool, but in a more believable sense. Campbell made Bond believable- you will smile at the movie but you don't have to wink anymore and you can throw away the grain of salt.",positive
"Incredible! Daniel Craig is the PERFECT (and also the hottest) Bond! The story is great, its got a fantastic Bond girl and its soo fun and wild. In my Top 10 of 2006 for sure!",positive
"I dunno if anyone believes me but My best friend's friend was in this film, she runs the Casino, and Danial Craig was born in the town I was!",positive
"I hadn't seen a Bond film until I bought 'Golden Eye' on a whim one day. After watching it, I went back and watched all of the films available, and have been a huge fan ever since. I do not mean to disrespect any previous Bond actor, but this is, in my opinion, the best Bond done thus far. Sean Connary is iconic, and no one can take that away from him. But, Daniel Craig's Bond is ingenious. He shows more vulnerability and less of the stylized force previous actors have shown. It is a great movie overall. And a special nod to one of my favorite actors, Dame Judi Dench, who has appeared in this and the past 4 Bond films as ""M"". Looking back, I wonder why she hasn't been ""M"" in EVERY Bond film.",negative
The best Bond film I've seen!,positive
thrilling classic adventure of 007. with compelling twists that'll keep you guessing.,positive
"To be honest, I prefer Brosnan for agent 007. This one did a good job tho...",positive
"hands down the best bond film ever. deep characterization, a parcour scene which actually fits the story line (which is hard... but yeah it fits sort of). martin campell really knows how to make well rounded bond movies, hopes he returns for the next film (23)",positive
I guess it was the best James Bond ever:)),negative
"An okay Bond flick, I don't think it lived up to the originals but it was entertaining. I dunno if I like Daniel Craig as 007 yet or not...",negative
"compared with other 007 movies, this one is relatively ""realistic"" --- no more superhero, a bit more of a royal lover.",negative
"This movie is so action packed and has a lot of hot girls, just like all James Bond movies do",positive
"I thought I was getting a Bond movie. Instead I get a Bond movie MADE FOR CHICKS. Seriously, this has got to be the most female-pandering I've ever seen in an action flick. The romance should've been a SUBplot - I didn't need to see Eva goddamn Green in every other shot and I sure as hell didn't need to see Bond shirtless and/or naked every other shot in between. You wanna know the movie? Bond gets naked, Bond meets some pain-in-the-ass and self-centered bitch, Bond gets naked again, Bond kicks a little ass, Bond gets naked and GOES TO CHECK UP ON THE CHICK TO SEE IF SHE'S ALL OKAY AFTER THE ASS-KICKING LIKE WTF IS THAT SHIT, Bond falls in love with the bitch, Bond wins some poker tourney that's important or whatever (let's get back to the bitch already!) Bond gets naked. You know how much female nudity we get for seeing Daniel Craig shirtless for a cumulative hour? NONE. NOT EVEN A NIPPLE. No, we just get cleavage from old lady and the bitch (but no one likes bitches anyway so that doesn't count). Oh, and throw in a few charming one-liners (which was almost always in romantic dialogue anyway). I swear, anything other the action (which was mediocre anyway because all I remember was a CGI building collapsing) seemed like it was tailored toward easily-exploited women. What is this, The Notebook meets Demolition Man? What a disappointment. Oh, and any guy who really likes this movie is a dumbass for not catching what I caught. You know, I've got nothing against romance, but I wanted to see a BOND MOVIE. Is that too much to ask? This movie should've been Bond being suave, kicking ass, being charming as hell, and not breaking a sweat while making passionate love. Simply disappointing. Thankfully, the ending seems to promise a real Bond sequel.",negative
Best. Bond. Film. EVAR!,positive
"A new Bond, a new beginning, jason bourne like. I wan accept that they make this for a movie, but if they continue, they'll loose a lot of fans....",negative
My favorite Bond movie BECAUSE... and don't get mad at me... it was the only one I didn't fall asleep during or see an invisible car in.,positive
the best bond yet cant wait for the next.,positive
"First & foremost, blonde Bond - We get it done better. Best Bond film yet, trumps every film before it. This was an action/drama well executed FILM. Not a host for product placement viruses like the last few stupid bond - what's one lash under movie? Like straight to video category.",positive
Best Bond since Connery,negative
"To be honest not a huge fan of the james bond franchise. that said i actually enjoyed this movie, it was genuinely entertaining. Daniel Craig was really good and I was glad to find Vesper a more interesting character than most bond girls (a bit more 3 dimensional). the poker scenes though i found a bit boring, but i'm not big on card games and those scenes seemed to last forever.",positive
"i dnt think that daniel craig was a good james bond in this film, lets hope he does better in his next bond film. there wasnt realli much point to this film it was mildly entertaining in some areas but realli boring in the rest of the film and the famous line ""Bond, James Bond"" is left until the end of the film this was very disappointing. lets hope he doesnt show up the name james bond in the next film",negative
One of the best 007 I loved among them...,positive
"I just saw this again on DVD, this is a really good movie",positive
Eh... I like Daniel Craig as Bond but the script was horrible.,negative
Best Bond Movie Ever made (until the next one),positive
"Drags a bit in the middle - watching people play cards is NOT entertainment, but other than that, a great return to form. Daniel Craig's Bond is a heartless thug, whose future exploits look certain to provide even more explosive action.",positive
a great james bond flick!,positive
"Dopo un quel bellissimo incipt in bianco e nero, in montaggio alternato, l'adrenalina impenna in una sequenza alquanto surreale e fracassona, ma altrettanto spettacolare. Lo spettatore resta interdetto, ma l'antipasto serve solo a stuzzicare l'appetito. Le portate migliori non si fanno attendere. Il miglior pregio del film Ã¨ sicuramente l'evoluzione del personaggio di Bond, sfregiato da momenti dolenti e crolli emotivi che mai ci saremmo aspettati. Uno 007 decisamente unamo, che si rivela in tutta la sua fragilitÃ  attraverso la love story con Vesper. Veramente splendida la scena della doccia, dove entrambi abbandonano l'armatura dietro alla quale proteggievano la loro emotivitÃ . Cuori che si sciolgono proprio sotto quell'acqua che tornerÃ  protagonista nel finale, non piÃ¹ accarezzandoli, tiepida, ma imprigionandoli in una scena altrettanto emozionante. Un Daniel Craig egregiamente in parte Ã¨ protagonista di un film davvero bello e completo, ricco di azione mozzafiato, dialoghi intospettivi, intense emozioni e ovviamente di quell'immancabile sagace umorismo, distintivo dell'agente a codice doppio zero. Incredibile pensare che Campbell aveva diretto quella boiata di Goldeneye. Meriti (e demeriti) della sceneggiatura.",positive
"This is why I bought a Blu-Ray player, one of the best Bond films.",positive
"I haven't seen many Bond movies...but this is definitely the best I've seen...very awesome...Daniel Craig brings Bond to level he should be on, not some campy post-Cold War business...and Chris Cornell's Bond song, ""You Know My Name,"" is great and fits the movie well",positive
"bof bof bof... succession de bonnes scenes d'action, mais un scenar qui m'a deplu - et puis pas fan de Daniel Craig en James Bond...",negative
"Eurk, pas de gadget, fin Ã  rallonge, fin du mÃ©chant minable...",negative
"Daniel Craig brings an new edge but also a very human side to Bond. Eva Green is one of more attractive Bond girls ever. Overall, a great job resurecting a Cold War franchise and making it relevant to today's post 9/11 world.",positive
The ruggedness of Daniel Craig as bond was one thing i was skeptical of... but his filmed delivered and delivered well- he proved that he has the acting ability to pull it off. It is one of my favourite bond films as you find out more of the human side to james bond and the begininngs of his character. I am looking forward to the quantam of solace to see how D.Craig goes again!!!,positive
Greatest bond since Goldfinger.,positive
"Thought Daniel Craig did a good job as Bond, James Bond",negative
The best and most realistic Bond movie!,positive
"This movie is to Bond what ""Batman Begins"" is to Batman. It's much more grounded than other Bond films, and if you're expecting his usual gadgets and silliness, then you'll be disappointed, but with this one they've brought back a level of mystery and plot complexity that we haven't seen since ""The Living Daylights"". Hopefully, they'll bring back the gadgets and other expected 'Bond stuff' in an appropriately grounded way in coming sequals, but this is exactly what was needed to breathe new life into the Bond series.",positive
The best Bond film by far.,positive
best bond movie ever,positive
"Daniel Craig surpases the Great Sir Sean Connery! This film redefines the Name Bond, James Bond!",positive
its bond so i lov it,positive
"A pragmatic, down-and-dirty, visceral Bond and an overdue change from the silliness to which we've grown accustomed.",positive
Daniel Craig is outstanding in his new role as the young 007. I enjoyed the darker undertones of this James Bond flick and look forward to Quantum of Solace.,positive
"El mejor Bond de todos. Creible, con escenas que parecen no de una pelicula de James Bond, con un malo muy tÃ©rror y con Eva Green",positive
"OK. So, Daniel Craig definitely has the tight bod and a ""perfectly formed arse."" His delivery was a bit hard to understand, which I addressed by putting on subtitles. The poker scene was good (but need to understand hold em). The butt torture scene sure hurt! A bit more action beyond the running, beating, car crashing would have enhanced the film. But, overall a good flick - enjoyable to watch. Looking forward to Quantum of Silence in November.",negative
My favorite Bond movie thus far : ),positive
finally watched this movie....great storyline and great stunts....Daniel Craig makes a fine 007.,positive
my god they changed James Bond from suave to deadly dangerous i like i like,positive
The best Bond movie yet.,positive
"This film has transformed the Bond franchise. It is much more of a drama than just an action thriller. The character development is quadrupled compared with other Bond movies. It also portrays a much more flawed and human Bond. Having said that, the action sequences are still of the highest quality. Can't wait for the next one!",positive
"For a loather of Bond, this film makes me want to see more of the British(?!) superagent. Supposedly this was an idea stolen from Tarantino, wonder whhat he would have done...",negative
One of the best Bond films to date.,positive
Made me appreciate James Bond,positive
"One of the best Bonds ever, different from the others in a good way.",positive
yet another great bond movie and the new bond did great.,positive
"All those who said that Daniel Craig was not the right choice, and those who still say such should be smacked. He was great!!!",positive
"Best Bond yet. I have been liking the Bond movies less and less with their very bad action sequences and catch phrases. This movie has a good story line, shows him as human, not a glamor hero that never gets dirty. It just has one action sequence that I thought was corny but the others were very good. Go see it.",positive
So much better than I was expecting. Bond is an actual character who makes an emotional connection. The torture scene isn't have bad either;.,positive
Best James Bond movie ever!,positive
"I love this movie. Everytime it comes on cable, I'd sit and watch Daniel Craig play poker.",positive
"I'm not a fan of James Bond movies, but this one was good. Daniel Craig is the new Bond!!",positive
Najbolji James Bond do sada...,positive
the opening sequences will blow you away. probably the best bond film yet in my opinion. cant wait for quantum of solace.,positive
We (Montenegro) have the best casinos in Europe :),positive
"Dark and vicious, but too many boring parts. Basically a poker movie with some secret agents and a beautiful girl.",negative
It's not that any aspect of this movie was really outstanding that makes it my favorite; it's just really easy to watch.,positive
ver great james bond movie,positive
A modern version with far more action than the original Bonds but its kept in context much better than the Moore entries and charm and character still drives much of the story.,positive
One of the best Bond movies for years. It kept the action or suspense going throughout and was a refreshing change from the silly gadgets we saw in Die Another Day.,positive
One of my favourite movies.,positive
Bloody Bond... entertaining movie with the best ever Bond movie title song. This movie is a marathon with lots of violence with a few smart jokes.,negative
"Finally!! The best Bond Film in ages. Daniel Craig really suits James perfectly. But the thing I am really satisfied with is the title sequence, no crappy copmuter generated rubbish like previous bond films. It is very nostalgic",positive
My favorite Bond movie,positive
"Well Daniel craig wasnt that bad as bond but I liked pierce way better, i just like pierce better as bond sorry daniel. well one thing I hate about this movie is that there's hardly any action in it and there's like no gadgets! How can u have a james bond movie without those kickass gadgets???!!! The car was cool. This movie could've been way better like no offence it shouldn't of been more of a drama it should've been more of a action film. I can imagine a much, much better james bond movie with pierce and more action/gadgets, etc. I thought daniel made a decent james bond. It was so so but most of the time I was bored watching it at the movie theater. I hope the next bond movie is better. And another thing I hated was that they only played the james bond theme at the end credits I mean come on how dumb is that!!?? I liked the ending though. And I hated how he only said 'Bond, James Bond' only once and it was at the very end of the movie. Better luck next time mr. craig the movie was ok but could've been SOOOOOOOOO much better!",negative
"crazy entertaining, funny, and smart. daniel craig is awesome. though i think pierce brosnan had the look down better, daniel craig beats him in every other aspect.",positive
Daniel Craig: yummmmmmmmmmmmm,positive
great spy bond film gagets,positive
"Good, but doesn't feel like a Bond film. Where were all the gadgets?",negative
this was dope.....cant wait for the next one! :DD,negative
Best Bond film EVER!,positive
"A great new approach for the Bond series, it was very interesting seeing Daniel Craig play Bond this time. Turned out really good though, just never could see him playing this role when I saw him in Layer Cake.",positive
one of the best opening scenes...wished they wouldn't have killed the delivery guy b/c it would have been worth it to see him go again. Loved the blond Bond...pulls off a very stand-offish character but does 007 justice,positive
Best Bond film ever!,positive
james bond. yay. this was a tiny bit of a let down but only cuz i had extreemely high expectations. still good,negative
"The intro credits were nice. That was the highlight of the movie. Mainly, because I didn't really get it. The poker, I get, but the plot... not really.",negative
One of the worst Bond movies ever. He's worse than Dalton.,negative
It was the WORSE JAMES BOND movie that I ever saw. If they make another one like that IT ALL BE THE LAST TIME I SEE A JAMES BOND MOVIE.,negative
Daniel Craig is the COOLEST Bond since Connery. Makes Roger Moore look downright silly.,positive
"Some of it was really good but Craig isn't Bond, sorry.",negative
Excellent. I didn't think they could re-interpret the Bond franchise into the 21st century. I was wrong.,positive
This movie was intense. So amazing. I loved it from the first scene.,positive
"I still say that Pierce Brosnan was the better Bond. Right next to Sean Connery. Ahem, Jessy.",positive
"My favorite Bond movie by far. Great directing, awesome scenes( including a long, but never boring chase sequence with parkour), and a powerful soundtrack all make this movie a must in your collection, and something you'll want to watch again and again.",positive
I actually like the new Bond...,negative
very good. that guy in the beginning of the film who could like jump from building to building so easily....i want him to teach tae bo so I can learn it,negative
Best Bond since Connery. Best Bond movie in a long time.,positive
"Excellent film, I have not been a fan of James Bond films but this one was brilliant. The action was tense and the fighting scenes were amazing! One of the best films of the year and all time action movie!",positive
"I was skeptical at first, but now I'd call the best made of the Bond films.",positive
Brill!! What a great edition to the 007 series!,positive
Good stunts thats about all,negative
"The first half is silly but entertaining. The second half is silly but also boring, making the audience wait for long periods of time between action scenes that are -- at best -- mediocre. Casino Royale starts of strong but after the first half it drags on for ages and the ending is nowhere near worth the agonisingly long wait. Its style is an awkward combination of the Bonds of yesteryear and original source material. The producers are trying too hard to have their cake and eat it too. At the end of the day it played out like a giant episode of 24, which is a very very bad thing. Daniel Craig is good as Bond but others have been better.",negative
007........james bond.....007,positive
I am in love with Daniel!,positive
"C'est con, improbable, mais j'ai aimé",negative
"This was a pretty good bond flick, but I kinda like all the bond flicks.",negative
maybe second to goldeneye,positive
At least they tried to put more politics into this movie.,negative
The beginning of a new Bond. Craig gives us a new tougher Bond just given his license to kill. Based on the original novel we are immediately thrust into an opening chase seen on foot and some great hand to hand fighting. Gone are many of the gadgets that we'd gotten use to and we are left with just the essentials. A great story helps us to learn how Bond came to be and why he is the he is. A must see!,positive
"I like Daniel Craig as Bond. For my money, he's a great choice for this new way of doing the 007 movies.",positive
"This is the only decent Bond movie i've seen. This is because is much more realistic, gritty and crude than the previus 20 movies of the series which are stupidly cartoonish. There's no pseudo-fantastic absurdities like invisible cars or villains that look like an unfunny Dr. Evil or a plot involving the world or part of it being destroyed. Matching with this new realistic crudeness, the film is also more cynical, it's a reinventing of the character.",negative
One of the best Bond movies so far. I love the classics but this one was good.,positive
The best Bond movie.,positive
"I really didn't think that I'd like Daniel Craig as James Bond or the movie as a whole, but I loved it. The action was great and it was more plausible than most James Bond movies.",positive
A great film... Daniel did a good job!,negative
WHHYYYYY LET CHRIS CORNELLL SING THE THEMEEE SOOOONNNNGGGG,positive
"I've seen all the Bond films and I think this is the best movie and Daniel Craig is the best Bond. I love Connery, but this really is a triumph for one to whom there was a great amount of resistance. Excellent adaptation of probably the best novel, action packed throughout, with a very human and identifiable side to the central hero.",positive
loved the movie!thought daniel creg did good for the new bond.greet new 007 film!!!,positive
Excellent with loads of action and adventure,positive
"This is not your Daddys Bond!!! I like the new look and attitude of this Bond. The other Bond's made thier Mark, now it's Craig's turn.",positive
Best Bond Ever and Best Bond Movie Ever!!,positive
I like this Bondfilm very much. Action. Fast cars. Women. Death. Tragedy. And Daniel Craig...,positive
Craig has done good work ...,negative
"After the last few bad Bond movies, this one took a page out of the Bourne series and took the Hollywood out of spy movies.",positive
"After the last few bad Bond movies, this one took a page out of the Bourne series and took the Hollywood out of spy movies.",positive
"Best Bond hands down...and that's not just because I'm young or because I'm hot for Daniel Craig. He's the toughest, smoothest, grittiest Bond of them all. Lost points for sappy-ish turn at the ending.",positive
Liked Craig as Bond...I think he matches what Bond is expected to be,positive
"Most of the old Bond films were so boring and corny, hard to finish them, this was a great film.",positive
"Este es un filme que gusta mucho, sin embargo en mi gusto personal, creo que la cinta va muy bien hasta que el villano principal empieza a pedir por su vida ante la amenaza de unos narcotraficantes, lo cual resta a partir de ese momento toda credibilidad como villano Bond. Sin embargo es un filme bien producido y meritorio de ver para conocer sobre la era Craig.",positive
BEST BOND EVER!! A Thrill Ride!,positive
Wasn't thrilled with the new James Bond...,negative
Excellent Bond movie. The rough feeling adds to it.,negative
"Best bond since . . . well, Goldfinger",positive
"Excellent ""reboot"" to a stale franchise, moving away from the over the top gadgets to a more Jason Bourne type story line was the correct move. Daniel Craig is the best Bond of all time he brings a real person to the 007 legacy. Overall a treat and my favorite Bond movie to date.",positive
"4 belesas - Una ves mas vuelve el agente BOND JAMES BOND. Despues de 4 peliculas realmente detestables que me toco vivir de este personaje, llega esta nueva secuela en la cual tenemos a Daniel Craig interpretando a este mitico personaje con licencia para matar. La pelicula arranca con una de las mejores, si no es la mejor persecucion a pie de la historia del cine ( otra la tenemos en PUNTO LIMITE). Luego una tremenda escena de accion en un aeropuerto y cuando parece ser que todo va a ser como siempre palo a palo. La pelicula baja para convertirce en un desafio de quien es el mas inteligente, el nudo de la pelicula es un duelo entre bond y un maleante de turno, por quien tiene la mejor mina, quien tiene el mejor auto, quien juega mejor al poker, y ya que estamos bajarle la caÃ±a a un narco.(OBVIAMENTE GANA BOND) todo esto contado de una manera maravillosamente entretenida y la pelicula nunca cae contiene pequeÃ±os momentos de accion extrema. No les quiero contar mas veanla!!",positive
"This is about as good as a Bond film gets. They went back to basics with this one and it worked brilliantly. Daniel Craig plays Bond with an unfinished edge at the beginning of his career. He brings the right mixture of charm, danger and menace that comes close to, but does not surpass, Connery. The story has the tone and straightforward storytelling of Fleming's novel with Bond as the government's ""blunt instrument"" that they throw at their enemies. This is just an awesome movie, dark and gritty with Daniel Craig bringing a Steve McQueen quality to the role. The action sequences were thrilling, Dame Judy Dench grand as always as M, Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre was good and Eva Green was the best ""Bond girl"" in quite sometime.",positive
Ylivoimaisesti paras Bond-leffa ikinÃ¤!,positive
"Paras Bond, ja hyvÃ¤ leffa noin muutenkin.",positive
Love action movies. Love James Bond movies. Love Daniel Craig.,positive
"i made it bout an hour into it and turned it off. daniel craig's eyes are breath taking, but his bad boy bond left me cold. i realize they need to take the franchise in a different direction. i am stuck on the old school gentleman bond.",negative
"daniel craig isnt d ideal 007...seems dey are losin d touch of a 007...007's right frm time are sleek,smart n use a lil bit of force wen needed...why is dat evri 007 movie always has a sex scene?",negative
"Absolutely LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this movie and as for Daniel Craig - he's the best Bond ever. I know this movie nearly off by heart and as is the curse of most of Bond's women, the actress won't be in any other films. As long as Daniel Craig is around all is right.",positive
More violent James Bond. Really good,positive
"""why would I need more time?... the bitch is dead"" capo James Bond!",positive
"I know - what took me so long to see this movie? The trailer for Quantum of Silence motivated me - and Casino Royale did not disappoint. Actually, Daniel Craig exceeded my very high expectations. Thanks for breathing new life into the all-time greatest film franchise.",negative
Pierce Brosnan was my favorite Bond until I saw this one. What a great movie!,positive
It's easily my favotite Bond movie.,positive
Bond is back! Daniel Craig rocks! Bring on Quantum of Solace!,positive
"So it's been an interesting thing in the past, but I've never actually watched a Bond movie in its entirety until now. Honestly, it was very cool. Confusing as hell, but very cool. I LOVED the opening sequence which was absolutely top notch, and being a relatively big Chris Cornell fan, you could not have done better. Bond certainly has the moves, a sweet car, deadly skills, and the ability to clean up rather well in between poker hands. I know a Bond tradition is to have the evil, scar carrying character torture James, but for the love of God, that was just wrong. Anyway, I'm excited for the sequel, and I don't think it'll disappoint.",positive
I've never seen a Bond movie I didn't like. Can't wait for the next one to come out in Nov!,positive
"Bottom Line: Casino Royale is a good Bond flick as long as you don't mind a revival of Timothy Dalton's version of James Bond. However, if you like Pierce and Sean, then you might be in for a nasty surprise as we see a vulnerable, and a not-as-likable James Bond running around creating havoc and frustration for the enemies. One necessity to a good movie is a likable main character, no matter what he or she does. This James Bond is well-portrayed, but not as decently fleshed-out as the action set pieces in this movie (best example is the insane chase/shootout in Madagascar). Craig was well-received, so be ready for the franchise gearing in a new direction, whether you like it or not. Be ready for a more violent, less gadgety Bond. For those of you that don't like this new Bond, there's always the new version of Get Smart. Why are you laughing?",negative
Best Bond movie in a long time.,positive
Just love how Daniel Craig handled this one ;-),positive
"was sceptical about the new Bond, but now that I've seen it (him), am totally SOLD!!! bring on the next one!!! Daniel Craig ROCKS!",negative
my favorite bond film,positive
Love this movie. Can't wait for the next one this fall!,positive
best bond movie!love daniel craig!,positive
"Daniel Craig brings Badass, to Bond! nuff said!",positive
"Daniel Craig, yes please!",positive
The most gritty and realistic Bond ever!!! Probably the best!!!,positive
probably one of my top three favorite bond movies next to thunderball and goldeneye.,positive
The best bond since Golden Eye,positive
"A shallow, uninteresting film with so much promise. The gadgetry is not existent, the plot is lame, and the tension is... what the phhhh- TEXAS HOLD EM? Are you joking, Bond? Do you expect me to laugh, or do you expect me to die?",negative
One of the best BOND films,positive
I don't understand poker..and he isn't that hot...at all. This movie was wasted on me.,negative
Best Bond movie! and looks pretty swell on blu ray... the opening chase scene is awesome.,positive
great change to a great series of films,positive
By far the best bond. I love this movie. The action and every facet is just better than most action movies I've seen.,positive
"The remake of Casino Royale is a reboot of the Bond series, with Daniel Craig as blond Bond.",negative
"Decent movie. The sequel looks more promising. When I saw the movie first time in theaters I thought it was pretty disappointing. But then I watched it a few more times when it was on HBO, and I have learned to appreciate it more.",negative
The worst opening credits sequence I've ever seen in a movie,negative
the only james bond film i actually enjoyed,positive
"By far my favorite Bond movie. I was extremely skeptical, but I loved every minute of it, even though it had multiple endings.",positive
"Daniel Craig brings a fresh, damaged side to the character. A slick vision.",positive
"From the Bonds I have seen, easily the best one.",positive
"I was pleasantly surprised with this film. It's got all the elements of 007 you expect. Lots of location changes, quirky bad guys, hot chicks and outrageous chase sequences. I really like how it has updated the bond world and yet managed to keep that 60's feel to certain elements. Danial Craigs version of 007 is brilliant. He is a dark character....just as any MI6 person should be. Cant wait for the next one.",positive
The grittiest Bond yet. Here's hoping Daniel Craig gives us more of what he brings to the character on his next bond flick.,positive
Probably my favorite Bond Film,positive
ok han e blonde men passe te rollen og filmen va faktisk bra. må sei eg blei imponerte,positive
1 of my fav bond movies full of action,positive
"One of the best Bond films ever made, Casino Royale creates a new side of 007 and focuses on the more human aspect, which makes the movie that more compelling and engaging.",positive
Best James Bond movie and actor. Throw all that British charm stuff out the window. Badassery wins the day. Also gets major props for the very limited use of CGI in the action scenes.,positive
Here's another good reboot. Forget the invisible car from the last Brosnan movie,positive
"A new modern Bond? This is a good movie because the overall storyline of 007 is being drawn from the start. Not too much attention on gadgets and car (altought the Aston DBS makes a noticeable appearance), the card game is what matters at the end. Room for a sequel.",positive
One of the best Bond movies. I was a little apprehensive about Daniel Craig but he was spot on.,positive
"Amazing, I didn't expect it to be so good; and you know what? I could smell the nostalgia from previous James Bond films, I didnt think it was THAT different; the rediculouness of the first chase scene, the character dynamics, the musical score and special effects etc. So yeah I loved it, it, Daniel Craig was brilliant despite my ever living opinion about how Bond should always have Dark Hair! *Shakes fist* lol. I loved the clicie moments but I noticed it wasnt a predictable movie which you'd think for a James Bond film would be a bad thing but in this context it worked. I loved the style of the opening scene and credits, wodnerful! And the very last scene? that was a MWAHAHAHAHA moment :) ""Long and boring"" Im sorry but I have heard that sentence wayyy too much, lack of patience in a viewer doesnt make a movie crap - I felt this film went by quite quickly and fluently as well as being highly enjoyable and thrilling. Overall brilliant imagery, brilliant acting, brilliant camera shots, brilliant dialogue (Some of thoise humerous quotes will stick with me for ever lol) just an amazing film!",positive

"The Bond producers wisely decided to give Bond a big shake-up, a very wise move after the increasingly silly Brosnan films. From the moment this opens with a brutal black and white fight sequence it's clear that Daniel Craig's Bond has been reinvented for the modern world and also updated to compete the Bourne trilogy. Craig's Bond may have fair hair but he has some dark depths of character, as well as insecurities and, who would've thought it, a loving sensitive side?! There are some great set pieces one of the best being an early free-running chase in a construction site. Eva Green shows how even Bond Girls can be given some humanity, not just a pretty object to dangle on his arm and their complex relationship gives the finale some emotional impact. Some of old Bond cliches are subverted and made fun of, others proudly upheld and it's the balance of the two that makes the film work really well. As someone with no nostalgia for the old Bonds I hope they continue with this style.",positive
LOVE IT! Daniel Craig is awesome as Bond.,positive
"Only Bond movie I ever saw. And frankly, only one I ever want to see. Unless, of course, Daniel Craig plays in another one.",positive
"OMFG..I just wanna say..I TOLD YOU SO cause I said he would be awesome and everyone was like..uh, I dunno, hes a blonde..well shut up cause he did awesome, minus the weird lip pouting thing he does and don't even get me started on the vanquish",positive
"I'm not really a James Bond kind of gal, but this was slick, fun, and sexy. The card game went on for far too long though.",positive
"One of the top tier of Bond movies. Although at times, it seemed like more of a poker movie. A very dramatic, tense, attention grabbing poker movie.",positive
"A great revamp of the series, which removes the annoying, gadgety, explosion-ridden Brosnan Bonds, ditches the rather impotent, joke-riddled Moore Bond films, and takes the darker nature of Bond from the eighties and places it in the feel of the original Connery films. Sure, it's not quite the same, M is hostile, the plot, characters, and tools feel more plausible, but it pumps much needed air into the series. One can only wait for the continuation of the story.",positive
Best Bond since Connery. Might be as good if not better.,positive
"After twenty films, the Bond franchise needed a reboot. It needed a fresh face, interesting characters, sexy women, and some bad ass action. Casino Royale, the 21st film in the series, has all of that and more. Daniel Craig plays James Bond who at the start of the movie has not yet received his 00 status. But after a successful mission shown in the prologue (in beautiful black and white), he receives the honor. On his next mission, things do not go as planned, so he decides to work alone without MI6's permission. On his adventure, Bond will find love, learn that he can't trust anybody but himself, and discover he likes his martinis shaken, not stirred. Casino Royale is exactly what this franchise needed. Following in the footsteps of other successful series, this is a fresh start for Bond. Instead of being a continuation of the previous movies, it's a stand alone product in and of itself. It's not so much the 21st film as it is the 1st in a new line of Bond movies. This film reinvigorates this franchise with flair and pizzazz, and more importantly gives me a reason to be excited about future installments. As much as I enjoyed Pierce Brosnan in the Bond role (second only to Sean Connery), the movies began to grow stale. While Daniel Craig certainly can't match up to those two, he overall did a great job putting his own spin on the character. However, at times he looked like he was trying a bit too hard. At one point in the movie, he walks out of the ocean after taking a swim. The way he puckers his lips and puts a little swagger in his walk makes him look like he's posing for a Playgirl photo shoot. But the absolute greatest strength of the movie is the terrific stunt work and excellently choreographed fight scenes. Every single one was exciting, even with the suspension of disbelief that you practically have to give into. In particular, the stunt work in an early chase scene is absolutely amazing. I've never seen such detail and thought put into a chase scene. It was a sight to behold for sure. But of course, the movie is not perfect. As with any good spy movie, Casino Royale is confusing as hell. I was with it at first, but then new characters started popping in only to be killed off shortly after and I wasn't sure why. It also has a lot of back stabbing and double crossing that just goes beyond what is needed. But it's a Bond movie so it was expected. Even still, when it does try to simplify the goings-on, it simplified it too much. For example, there is a poker sequence in the middle section of the film. As a poker player, I know how the game works, but even people who aren't should know the basic rules. But the movie constantly stops the action to explain what's going on, why somebody is bluffing, how much money is in the pot, etc. It's insulting to the viewer's intelligence. Film is a visual medium. I don't need everything spelled out for me through dialogue. The poker was also very unrealistic. Granted, it was spiced up to make the movie more interesting. But on every hand, somebody had a flush, which would be beaten by a full house, which would be beaten by a higher full house, which would be beaten by a four of a kind, or something alone those lines. It was pretty ridiculous. The poker scene could have been the most interesting part of the movie, but it ended up being the most distracting. The film just never struck that balance between simple-minded and overly confusing and usually rested on one of those extremes. There were also a few scenes that didn't work. At one point in the movie, Bond kills a couple of guys with the help of his new girlfriend. She gets upset and sits in the shower claiming that she has ""blood on her hands."" So Bond sits down with her and starts sucking on her fingers. What? How is that going to help? It was incredibly stupid and received an unintentional laugh. The end was also pretty weak. Without ruining anything, it tries to get all sentimental and mushy and it does not work at all. In fact, I just plain didn't care. The movie is only a few minutes shy of two and a half hours and by this point, I was done. These scenes and a few others could have been cut out to make the movie about 15 minutes shorter and it would have been much better. There's no doubt that the movie has some major shortcomings. But I think this is a case of where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. A new start is exactly what the franchise needed and Casino Royale is a promising beginning in a new era of Bond films.",negative
"Very good installment in the Bond franchise. Daniel Craig bring all sorts depth (and a killer physique) to the role. Not the typically smooth, womanising Bond of the past but a contemporary, flawed and somewhat nihilistic Bond that is infinitely more interesting.",positive
I guess I just don't get it. I was just waiting for it to get good until it ended. I was dissapointed. Was way to much of a boring movie.,negative
This movie made me a Bond fan.,positive
Overall excellent film. Daniel Craig is by far the best actor for the role of 007 and reinvents the character fantastically. Not just another Bond movie.,positive
Maintenant je suis rÃ©conciliÃ© avec les James Bond ; et Daniel Craig assure !,positive
"James bond had died after Goldeneye, which was a great rehashing in itself, but Craig does it so much better in this film. After reading the books, this Bond takes James Bond back to his roots and introduces the world to the real bond, that Flemming had written on page. Craig delivers a brutal, hard boiled and vicious Bond that we have all been waiting for. Gone are the gadgets and in are the no holds barred fights, showing us that bond is the right man for the job. Green is stunning as the bond girl, giving almost every bond girl in recent times a run for there money. If you are a fan of the originals, then give this a try and if you love the Bourne films, defiantly check this film. Can't wait till the new bond, as Bond is back with a bang!!!",positive
It wasn't a Bond movie...no cool gadgets and what not! Everything worked out too perfectly for Bond. He didn't even care if his martini was shaken or stirred! I bet he can pick his nose with his pinky fairly well...It had its moments.,negative
"This movie is great. I don't want to put my man card in jeopardy by insulting Connery's Bond, but Daniel Craig was an awesome interpretation.",positive
"Ok, I admit I didn't see it from the beginning (and I regret that), that it was very nice and all when it wasn't TOO Bond-ish, but I don't see it as a masterpiece. Awesome car. Almost better than the girl.",negative
Finally a Bond worthy of Ian Fleming,positive
Bond is back in a whole new way. I see Craig as going down as one of the best Bonds in the franchise. Can't wait for the movies to come!,positive
A bond movie i really liked,positive
"I'm glad that I finally got around to seeing this. I'm not big on following the Bond films. I've seen 3 out of the four Brosnan flicks... and I was never really impressed. And yeah... I played Goldeneye and got into that storyline, but nothing about the Bond series has ever really wowed me. But this movie is an exception.",positive
"I don't see why everyone says this movie is so good? I thought it was ok. It wasn't anything special. Maybe I expected more out of it being a James Bond flick but, it didn't impress me. Craig was good but, engh",negative
"It was ok, but it didn't have the James Bond effect.",negative
I'm fairly certain this is one of my favorite Bond movies of all time.,positive
"ive got this on blu-ray, and it is tight. the part i absolutely hate is the part where he wrecks the Aston Martin DBS. that is an awesome $130,000 Aston Martin, i mean cmon. o well, at least they set a new world record for that",positive
Best Bond film in a decade. Daniel Craig brings back the Sean Connery type of Bond. Lots of actions...2 thumbs up,positive
The way Bond movies should be.,positive
Love & Action...James Bond is back to life!! :-),positive
"Not only a triumphant return for 007, but the absolute best in the series.",positive
Bon d'accord... surtout pour l'acteur et moins pour l'histoire,positive
i'm going to have to say that this is just as good as any bond film EVER MADE!!!,positive
Daniel Craig is simply the best James Bond to ever grace the big screen.,positive
great return of Bond,positive
"Eva Green is gorgeous. She is my favorite bond girl. I totally wanted to be her in this movie. I thought this movie was great, it didn't feel like a bond movie though, maybe like a bourne identity movie, or something.",positive
"I really quite liked this movie. I thought it was great! Craig makes an excellent Bond. This Bond 's definitely his own unique person. He's a bit more of a loose cannon and it is fun to see something different. I was surprised by the lack of gadgets and babes, which are usually found in these films, but it still felt true to a double-o.",positive
Bond is most definitely back...,negative
This one was hard for me to follow,negative
Stirred or shaken? Do I look like I care?,positive
"Pretty good Bond movie. I don't know if I really like Daniel Craig as Bond, I think the others have been better, he was not suave enough for James Bond. It held my attention though and was there was definitely a good twist at the end that I was not expecting!",negative
It was ace!!!But i was very tired after watching till 3am!,positive
Did not live up to the hype for me. Good action but still pretty bog standard Bond.,negative
"best james bond yet. he doesn't have invisible cars, watches that shoot lasers, or any other rediculous gadgets.",positive
A Bond movie that didn't put me to sleep.,positive
Daniel Craig is the BEST james Bond!,negative
best bond film so far....daniel craig is one of the best bonds....him and connery,positive
like 45 minutes of poker? it's crap,negative
"Finally a reason to love Bond again. I was skeptical when Craig was cast for this role, but I ended up loving his portrayal of a darker, more calculating and human Bond who does not rely on gadgets or play it over the top. CR is the best thing to happen to the franchise since Connery.",positive
The best James Bond on my eyes. He doesn't need all the gadgets that Pierce Brosnan' caracter needed!!,positive
"After the last few terrible Brosnan Bond movies, the series was in need of a reboot, and Casino Royale does the job nicely. Daniel Craig's Bond is a much darker shade of Bond, which works well considering the whole license to kill. While many of the Bond movies are good simply because they're entertaining, this one is actually a quality watch, even if it wasn't a Bond film.",positive
"One of my favorite bonds, with a new twist on the classic savy spy. A little long, pretty much broken into three parts, yet a definative classic in the Bond Collection. Daniel Craig is spectacular.",positive
A great new direction for the Bond movies.,positive
Wasnt that good but now I really want to see it again.,negative
Watched this again the other night. I've never been a Bond fan but this movie is kick ass. In fact I have never seen any other Bond movie. I only know Goldeneye because of the video game on Nintendo 64.,positive
confusing and scarey,negative
You can't get much hotter than Daniel Craig...,positive
"I have to be honest going in I didn't know how I would feel with a blonde Bond. Not two minutes into the movie did I realize that I didn't care what his hair color was Daniel Craig is James Bond. This movie delivers, although nothing really tops the first action scene, Daniel Craig is funny, smart, and is definatly James Bond. The one woman bond learns his lesson and kicks some serious James Bond butt.",positive
this is the best James Bond film i seen,positive
"I don't care what anyone else says, Daniel Craig freakin' rocks this movie! Whether you are a Bond fan or not, this Reboot of the franchise is awesome, and more than makes up for the Lazenby / Moore days.",positive
The best bond film so far.,positive
"If you were a power-hungry, morally corrupt, fearlessly determined and super powerful villain, which of these agents would you be the most unhappy to find yourself pitted against: Jack Bauer from 24, Jason Bourne from the Ludlum books and films, or suave old James Bond himself. I don't know about you, but I'd much rather see an aging Roger Moore blocking my path than a trigger-happy Kiefer Sutherland or a moody yet scarily efficient Matt Damon. Yes, James Bond has been in need of a 21st century makeover for some time now, and in Casino Royale, we finally meet a representation of the character that we can believe in, regardless of how outrageous the premise may be. http://www.theyowie.com.au/2008/07/01/casino-royale-film-review/",negative
"argubaly the best bond yet. becuase of this movie i want to change my life's work to becoming a spy.daniel craig has turned bond into a total BAMF. though he already was. thumbs up ol' chap, thumbs up",positive
One of the best James Bond movies I have ever seen.,positive
Siempre he disfrutado las pelis de Bond y esta me parecio muy buena la historia y las secuencias de acción muy bien logradas,positive
My favorite movie. Perfect film.,positive
it kicked ass. the opening chase scene. damn!,negative
Two words: Daniel Craig.,positive
Daniel Craig made a good Bond.,positive
I enjoy the James Bond series. Especiallly this new one. Daniel Craig is my new favorite James Bond. The role is much more darker and badass now.,positive
"I was never really into the whole James Bond series, but this movie definitely changed my views on that. Daniel Craig is an amazing Bond, much much much better than Pierce Brosnan, or any other recent Bond adaptation. The movie itself isn't necessarily about the action, but it's more about the suspense. From the pursuits on the city streets, to the flops, turns, and rivers on the poker table, Casino Royale just draws you in right away and is full of so many twists, turns, and downright memorable moments that will definitely entertain you, whether you like Bond or not. (Saw this like 5-6 months back, but I never reviewed it, haha).",positive
"WOW, best Bond since Sean Connery",positive
Pierce Brosnan is sooooo much better.,negative
should be goofy like the old ones,negative
good new bond and i love poker so i loved this movie,positive
Damn! Daniel Craig is perfection as James Bond. The action scenes in this film are some of the best I have ever seen.,positive
Die Another Day is still my favorite.,negative
Great restart to the James Bond Series. Cannot wait for the next installment.,negative
"Craig is such an improvement to all the previous terribly-brittish Bonds, apart from Sean Connery",positive
"Bon, ai du mal avec Daniel Craig catalogué ""méchant vilain"" depuis les Sentiers de la Perdition (Road to Perdition). Mais Eva Green (envoutante) relève le niveau, même si on a un peu perdu la classe british au profit de mêlées explosives de partout.",negative
Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery; hands. down.,positive
"Best bond....and Danil Craig YUMMY!! Cant wait for the next one, hopes its just as brutal and realistic :)",positive
Daniel Craig - need I say more?! Definately the best Bond film.,positive
Finally a James Bond that delivers style and ultra-believable character. Great action scenes that will make the palm of your hands sweat especially the building chase at the start.,positive
Some of the older Bond film I found were cheesey but not this one.Action that makes you sit up in the seat and a sexy Bond.,positive
from the start this film gets it all wrong with shitty opening music to a gadet actionless final. the best bit of this film is the crane action scene. what more can i say 'don't do it again',negative
its too boring for james bond.i was waiting more action.i fall sleep when im watching the poker scenes.,negative
the best James Bond ever !!!,positive
good for a bond film,negative
They definitely put the spark back in 007.,negative
typical bond movie nothing new...,negative
"It grows on me more each time i see it, but it still suffers, like so many films these days, from being too long. Sometimes less IS more. Although it's great to have a grown up's James Bond.",negative
not a huge fan of daniel craig but the movie was good,positive
A great reboot to Bond.Though not the best it is easly in the top 5. Daniel Craig gives one of the great bond preformances and in my opinion is second only to Sean Connery.The story is more realistic and all of the actors were in top form.,positive
"Tre en halv stjerne, bare pga. Daniel Craig",negative
"Probably one of the best bond movies ever. I am a fan of Connery, but Craig is a close second.",negative
vivement le prochain!!!,positive
"not bad, but it didnÂ´t feel like james bond movie",negative
"Daniel Craig fills the Bond role very well - Sean Connery-ish! One of the better Bond movies Ive seen in a while, and you gotta love those Bond girls! Looking forward to the next with Craig.",positive
"Daniel Craig is the best Bond in years. However, the movie should have ended about 12 times before it did.",positive
Mmmmm... I love it this movieeeeee.,positive
The best james bond!!,positive
Who knew Daniel Craig would be the perfect Bond after Sean?,positive
"[b][size=4]'Casino Royale'[/size][/b] [i]Martin Campbell, 2006 [/i] [img]http://i290.photobucket.com/albums/ll279/JediMoonShyne7/3-88.jpg[/img] Having been brought up in England, the name James Bond is one I associate with my childhood. Apart from the fine breath the English have given to comedy over the past fifty years, they are lacking when it comes to film. One franchise though that has always been apparent (at least in my eyes) is Ian Fleming's '[b]007[/b]' series. Not classic cinema by a long shot but always there and attempting to steal the action crown away, year after year. The films have come under scrutiny in recent times, where people have been perhaps rightfully accusing the newer editions in lacking the character that the older ones presented. I believe this criticism peaked after Bond's last outing, where much of the film was based upon our hero's love-interest slash partner in crime. That was an attempt to reinvigorate the flagging franchise that failed miserably. Four years on however, a similar attempt (at least in scale) has been almost successful. [img]http://i290.photobucket.com/albums/ll279/JediMoonShyne7/2-102.jpg[/img] '[b]Casino Royale[/b]' sees the first outing of new, blue-eyed Bond Daniel Craig. Who came in for much examination when his name was first announced. ""He's too short, too blonde, too Northern"" etc. The truth is that James Bond needed somebody of Craig's will and vision to make him human again. In fact he is taken past human, all the way down to the gritty earth. This edition is by far the most abrasive, bold and more importantly most realistic take on our good spy that I have witnessed. The film is far from perfect, it dwells too much on the romantic scenes, and I found it contradictory that a person who could not be touched was willing to throw his career away for a woman. In my experience, women in Bond movies are stunning, helpless, wandering into gunfire only to be saved for the third time. This outlook seems to have changed thoroughly, but it did not take away from what was a very refreshing edition to a franchise that was previously on its knees. It is for this effort that the film sneaks into my top ten of the year, a very courageous attempt to entirely overhaul a dying series that for lack of a better script, succeeds in doing so. [b]7/10 [img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/statusicon/forum_new.gif[/img][/b]",negative
ooh. i saw this on a plane!! haha,positive
better than I expected,negative
"Not the best bond movies ever made... that goes to ""Dr. No"" but it is a GREAT Bond movie with a decent Bond",positive
"Daniel Craig has one expression, the ""I'm dark and mysterious but can still cap your ass"" look. See that promotional poster above? That's it. For the whole movie.",negative
James Bond undergoes a killer reboot. The best Bond for years. Daniel Craig is awesome and now all his detractors are nowhere to be seen,positive
"The only James Bond movie I have really liked - not entirely happy with the way everything turned out, but it was realistic for Bond, I think.",positive
Daniel Craig...papacito,positive
I thought he made a Great James Bond,positive
Excellent bond film. A must see.,positive
Solid James Bond film.,negative
"I was very surprised that I liked this movie. I'm not usually a Bond fan, but I must confess that Daniel Craig makes a GREAT James Bond...best ever, in my opinion. This movie was very realistic (unlike other Bond movies), and very enjoyable. I'd definitely watch it again.",negative
"daniel craig has moulded well into the role of bond, I think this is one of the bestbond films ever.l",positive
Great film especially the poker playing and action keeps u on your seat the whole time thank u Vida 4 buying it 4 me!!!!!!!!,positive
this was NOT a bond. but he was a good bond. i had to watch golden eye after to be satisfied.,negative
"Mmm, yummy! Of course I watched this for one reason only... (the stars are not for the movie but the main actor....lol)",positive
"casino royale has to be one of the best james bond films for over 20 years. this is also my favourtie james bond film in the series. the story for this film if you don`t know is about James Bond's first 007 mission takes him to Madagascar, where he is to spy on a terrorist Mollaka. Not everything goes as planned and Bond decides to investigate, independently of the MI6 agency, in order to track down the rest of the terrorist cell. Following a lead to the Bahamas, he encounters Dimitrios and his girlfriend, Solange. He learns that Dimitrios is involved with Le Chiffre, banker to the world's terrorist organizations. when i found found out that daniel craig was going to be the new james bond i rented and also brought some of his films ( like layer cake etc ... ) and i can tell you i wasn`t disappointed. good film , good specail effects , action sences and also poker game. the thing what spoils this film is that it doesn`t have the gadgets which had them in the other james bond fims. casino royale shouldn`t be a 12 i reckon it should be a 15.",positive
"A rare find for a fairly recent film, I thought this was an absolutely wonderful effort for one that is part of a series. Bond is portrayed as much more human, and in turn, much more tangible as a character than he was in the previous installments; Daniel Craig offered a performance nothing short of outstanding, and his on-screen chemistry with Eva Green is perfectly in-character and a pleasure to watch. The plot is strong, surprising, and brisk, never leaving time for a dull moment before another dramatic development changes the setting. To be perfectly honest, this is one of those movies I just plain do not get sick of watching.",positive
I liked the new image they are showing of James Bond...He is imperfect and vulnerable like any one of us.,positive
one of the best bond movies I have seen .. :),positive
"Loved it..the darer bond characer is brilliant. I don't care is it is almost unbondish. I like where they are taking him. Don't live in the past. A complete reproduction of an old movie would be boring. Movies are an artform, subject to the contemporary ideals and desires of society. It is up to the director to interpret how these forms of influence shall have an impact on his/her film.",positive
"This movie has it all. A hottie, action, gambling ..",positive
The only Bond movie I actually enjoy.,negative
"If expecting a James Bond movie, it may anyway disappoint you. Weirdly enough, no sexy women in the credits! Missed John Cleese, also.",negative
"One of the better 007 movies of late. Daniel Craig fills the bond shoes well, and will have a long future in this role. The opening chase scene is the best foot chase ever filmed. Overall an excellent movie.",positive
i thought it was quite boring,negative
"The film is a rebot of the James Bond series. it shows a more darker and voilent side of 007. the film does an excelent job perparing you for the sequel coming out later this year by providing mystery, action and drama. as i watched the film with great interest, the film makes sure that i have to watch the sequel in order to get the true plot behind the first film. the film is excellent and i recommend it to james bond fans both new and old alike!",positive
"Assez distrayant, mais pas le meilleur pour moi.",negative
"I really enjoyed Craig as the new breed of 007. His character was more believable, but hit all the points that his predecessors did. Great flick.",positive
"I finally got around to seeing it and I was not disappointed at all. It had all the Bond necessities from unique lines to a great plot. The story was full of twists and plots, and although Daniel Craig did a great job, Pierce Brosnan is still my favorite actor for the Bond role.",positive
No es Sean Connery ...pero me encanta! HacÃ­a tiempo que esperaba un Bond asÃ­.,positive
"Probably the best Bond ever or at least even with On Her Majesty's Secret Service with me - wait a minute, no it is the best Bond ever.",positive
"Thoroughly enjoyed this shot in the arm to the Bond franchise, of which I am a long-time fan.",positive
"Simply put: This is the best Bond movie ever made, and a just a great movie, period.",positive
"Great ""reboot"" of the Bond franchise.",positive
"I was seriously impressed at how well daniel craig took the bond role and really made it his own. Very dark, sinister, and the tech was actually believable for once. Time will tell who's the best bond, but he's going to give sean connery a run for his money.",positive
"Breathes some much-needed life into what had become a very stale franchise. Daniel Craig makes for a much more interesting Bond than Brosnan, Dalton, et. al. and it's much better written than previous installments. Now, if only they'd realized that watching people play cards doesn't make for a very exciting moviegoing experience...",positive
Now everyone will know that you've scratched my balls.,positive
Raw fun. Can't wait for QoS,positive
"I wasn't as fond of this movie as a lot of people - it's good, but somehow the shizzle is missing. Daniel Craig makes a good Bond but he's just a bit too human, and the loss of Q and Moneypenny is sorely felt. Reboots are usually a mistake and I think this one was as well.",negative
not the same without pierce he was james bond to me! Daniel craig looks just as old and is blonde james bond has to be dark and mysterious lol,negative
"un tres bon james bond, surtout comparÃ© au precedent opus dans lequel on commencait franchement a se diriger vers le grand n'importe quoi",negative
This is one of the best Bond movies in years. Craig was nearly as good as Connery.,positive
"James Bond is back and better than ever. I had my doubts at first but after opening night, I knew that Daniel Craig is going to be one of the best James Bonds since Sean Connery.",positive
I love Bond movies...if there truely is a gay sceen in the new on ethis november then i will slit someones throat because Bond would never sleep with another man. He would shoot the fag and ask someone else the question,positive
"Oh, yeah. Can I give six stars?",positive
the best james bond!!! yeahhhhh et non j'ai pas honte du tout et j'assume!! c'est le meilleur y a rien Ã dire!,positive
1 of the fab movie on 007....Daniel craig n his superlative stunts n attitude makes movie damn kick ass,positive
One for people who love the books!,positive
"love this movie! love the fashion, and love daniel craig! one of my favorite james bond movies!",positive
"I was so skeptical how he was gonna do the Bond, I liked the image of Sean Connery so much. But I think the guy nailed it. Another great Bond film has come out, I say.",positive
"Finally, a believable James Bond.",positive
"hmm. james bond w/ a heart? je suis confused. but there's nothing hotter than a sensitive warrior, look at the gladiator. i guess i can get w/ this. i like it.",positive
"when i heard that Daniel Craig was going to be the next 007 i was excited cause he was spectacular in ""layer cake"" and he is the best bond since Sean Conery.",positive
roll on quantum of solace...,positive
One of the best Bond movies ever!,positive
"James Bond movies are a guilty pleasure, but this one takes it up a notch with a more gritty and down-to-earth approach.",positive
A great movie with plenty to revive this ancient series. Thought Bond was over? Think again.,positive
Daniel Craig best Bond ever?? U bet ya!,positive
"FED stil, han kan blÃ¸de nu",positive
"True Bond, like the books, less silly gadgets, more being tough but actually still getting hurt",positive
"I think i like Craig as the new bond, but Pierce was always my favorite for some reason.",positive
"By far the most realistic Bond action, and a bit more like I remember the books than the more flashing, corny Bonds.",positive
best james bond movie ever. daniel craig is definately the best one,positive
"An effective modernization of Ian Fleming's novel, which raises my faith in the wisdom of rebooting the movie franchise.",positive
good piece of work... more blood than normal and more rough-and-tumble than your usual James Bond film!,positive
"This by far tops all the Bonds films I've seen, which is many. I highly recommend seeing this film many times over for excellent action and story, cast and scenic settings. But be forewarned, this is not a PG-13 film. In my opinion, it deserves, to be rated no less than an R. And that in no way detracts anything from the tremendous film that it is.",positive
"All I can say is "" Bond with a difference"" and I like him this way too.",positive
"I liked the ruggedness of this Bond, but it really didn't feel like a true Bond movie.",negative
I give it a four and a-half star move!,positive
"A great reboot to the tride and true franchise. Not as action packed as normal, and perhaps 20 minutes or so too long, but great nonetheless.",negative
Amazing new take on the James Bond character perfect casting character was very believable and it took the goofy ness out of this very cool and witty spy.,positive
Daniel Craig did not let Bond fans down.,positive
"Probably my favourite Bond, though the poker scenes werw a tad on the ridiculous side at times, I enjoyed Craig as Bond - I bought it the whole time. Most of the Action felt more Bourne than Bond, in a good way.",negative
Awesome love James Bond!,negative
"Great flick...by far, the most attractive man out there in film!",positive
Daniel Craig is just yummy in this film,positive
This movie was pretty stupid. It was entertaining though.,negative
"Bond is back with a bang, Baby!",positive
"Classic Bond, whats not to be liked about it...",positive
bonne variation sur le meme theme,negative

"yeah, yeah, cool. but is anyone ever gonna remember it?",negative
the best bond in a long time gritty i got goosebumps at the end when he finlaly said bond...james bond and edgey makes up for brosnen kite surfin off a iceberg,positive
A fun action film. The best Bond film.,positive
this movie has tons of action daniel craig is amazing at being bond,positive
Daniel Craig has proved others wrong and is indeed the best bond after connery.,negative
Balances the line between horrifically cheesy and dramatic delivery so well! I love it! The action and romance are well-placed and well-casted.,positive
i don;t watch after he gets beaten the rest of the movie is too dramatic and not in sync with the other bond movies,negative
"The perfect movie. The stunts were INCREDIBLE! George Lucas could learn from this movie. Besides Dr. No of course, this is my all time favorite Bond film. Unlike the other movies, in this one, Bond is actually as B.A. as Jason Bourne.",positive
"Action from the word go, Daniel Craig is the next 007, watch out there will be more to come",positive
Yea Quantum of Solace was better but this is the second best Bond film ever!!!,negative
just plain awesome!! one of the best Bonds ever!!,positive
"I was definitely a sceptic in the begining. I mean, a light haired James Bond? I'm not sure if I can swallow that. But color me pleasantly surprised, Daniel Craig pulls it off with great form. Is it the best James bond movie I've ever seen? No, but it ranks up there with the likes. I look forward to seeing what this far more human James Bond does in the future.",positive
"Pretty sweet, Daniel Craig is one of the better Bonds by far. I also appreciated the minimal use of gadgets, rampant product placement did get on my nerves though.",negative
the hottest james bond ever!,positive
"this movie is so cool, and Daniel Craig is hot in there!",positive
The best bond movie. Daniel Craig is the perfect bond.,positive
"Brings Bond back to the beginning, based on Fleming's source material. A good movie for the poker enthusiast as well.",positive
Daniel est dur et Eva douce,negative
"Will they ever stop making these movies? Actually, this is surprisingly one of the best, and darkest Bond films.",negative
Daniel Craig is a good James Bond.,negative
"I was a little skeptical of a new bond, but he pulled it off with flying colors.",positive
"Da jeg endelig fik set den, var den faktisk rigtig god. Daniel Craig er en super Bond...",positive
The best bond movie yet.,positive
I don't care what the critics say...Daniel Craig is an awesome James Bond!,positive
"Even after three viewings, still my favourite Bond movie. Retains the flair of the original Bonds which heralded their success, but carries a dark, sinister tone throughout which adds a new and intriguing layer to an already fascinating character.",positive
"Amazing fucking movie. Best bond since Connery, and this one had even more style.",positive
"Daniel Craig will make a fine new Bond! Finally, the first Bond book by Ian Flemming gets the treatment it deserves.",positive
"Stunning Chase Sequence, no real plot or closure, though I must say I like the new Bond.",negative
"Definitely the best Bond movie since Connery. Eschewing the outlandish premises and jokiness that sank so many other flicks in the franchise, they took what the Bourne movies did and improved upon it with a more fully realized character.",positive
"Let me make this clear, I'm not a fan of Bond. It was a little too tongue-in-cheek for me. Which is why I love this movie! It's absolutely a reboot of the franchise and a fresh take on the character of James Bond. A tougher, grittier Bond that's believable as a super-spy. Then, add to it, the movie takes place in my backyard of the past few months. Watching Bond drive past a street I'm on every day makes me chuckle. Worse yet, the ""hotel"" in the movie is right next door to my family's old house ... so it's kind of nostalgic. Sorry, got side tracked, the movie itself is truly a step up and I am anxious to see if they keep this style of Bond for the next one in the series.",positive
wwwwooooooooooooooowwwww IT'S AMAZING... I LOVE IT.. MO.,positive
action packed movie.,negative
Not as good as i thought it would be the begining chase was the best part.,negative
i liked the old blnds better!,negative
"Wow, what a pleasant surprise. I'm not a Bond fan but this was truley a good film. Can't wait for the next Craig installment.",positive
movie 20 was much better but this is still good,positive
Close to a phenomenal book as you can get and played with the right level of danger and suspense. A great new beginning for Bond,positive
"Taut, well-directed action set pieces and a smooth, stylish debut for Daniel Craig as Bond.",positive
welcome back bond. you're no longer lame. it's been far too long.,positive
He's one hot bond with a mouth to make me melt!,positive
"I admit I have a man crush on Daniel Craig, great freakin flick!",positive
Daniel Craig makes a cool bond.,positive
see previous bond movie,negative
"Daniel Craig as Bond is great, and the movie had an amazing feel to it. However, it didn't quite feel like watching a bond movie.",positive
"A somewhat mixed bag for me. Starts strongly with a great action sequence and some really strong scenes at the Bahamas & Miami but did not maintain that level throughout. The last 30 minutes lacked something, and I did not find the ending very satisfying. Daniel Craig did a terrific job. Looking forward to his next 007 adventure.",negative
James Bond. A reflection of the times....When Everybody was obsessed with Texas Hold'em Poker.,positive
"A brilliantly entertaining film, and a magnificent performance from Craig",positive
"les gadgets me manquent, mais Ã§a reste un trÃ¨s bon J.B.",negative
Some solid parkour inthe beginning.,positive
Okay until they get into the actual story.,negative
"The one major fault of this Bond movie is its (dis)continuity. I understand that it shows the birth of Bond, but Judi Dench--not a Bernard Lee type--plays M. Also, something just doesn't sit right when I think about the entire Bond legacy and consider that during Bond's birth, according to this movie, there was such technology as cell phones. I do like the touch that Bond was fairly bad at his job at his birth, however, and Craig is some nice eye candy.",negative
Great movie. Opening chase scene is jaw dropping.,positive
"When i first saw the previews for this flick, I didnt like the looks of Daniel Craig at all. But when i saw it, It exceeded my expectations and i vote it one of the best James Bond movies ever made. If you like a really good action movie, this movie is the one to see.",positive
"Very good outing for Jimmy boy. This part of the franchise is a reset, and styles itself a la 24 and Bourne Identity. Well worth a watch for thriller fans.",positive
"i dont know he lost in poker had to ask for more money to keep playing, he died bad rep for 007",negative
Craig good. Film bad.,negative
"Daniel Craig is the best James Bond since Sean Connery. I really liked the ""new look"" they were looking for. Eva Green was also hot, I just wish she hadn't killed herself(spoiler warning). Also, the chase scene at the very beginning was AMAZING! Hope the next movie is just as good.",positive
"the best bond movie! Craig did an excellent job, the plot was good and the direction was top notch! and for once there were NO GADGETS!",negative
"I'm not a fan of Bond, but this film made me think that the relaunch actually has a chance at being a decent series.",positive
"Good news: James Bond's back!!! There are stunts (not silly special effects like in the previous movie) that serve a suspenseful and realistic scenario. Daniel Craig gives humanity and depth to his character, who has weaknesses but learns from his mistakes. Mads Mikkelsen portrays a cold and frightening Le Chiffre.",positive
"A refreshing new look at Bond,Craig's awesome.",positive
"Sweet movie, action packed!",positive
gay. i don't think i've ever seen a bond movie i liked. i just always find them utterly boring.,negative
- You're not my type of woman - Smart? - Single,positive
"Was kind of over-hyped to me, but a good re-boot for the bond franchise",negative
"And then there was M. Campbell, and thus the cinematic world knew peace. He took the franchise and turned it into something smarter, wittier, and much more thrilling than any Bond film in decades. D. Craig turns Bond into a psychologically deep character with conflicts of emotion and duty, and a ruthlessness towards his enemies that has never been seen before. The dialogue actually drives the plot forward instead of being weighed down with endless 'conversations' consisting of humorless one-liners. The love interest is, for once, NOT a complete slut like previous lead female characters, and the villain is definitely an eccentric megalomaniac in true Bond fashion, but isn't a mad scientist hell-bent on destroying china with a death-ray orbiting earth at a ransom of $100,000,000,000. And no fucking gadgets. THANK YOU, SOMEONE FINALY HAD THE SENSE TO DO IT. So see the movie, because it is most definitely awesome.",positive
The best Bond movie. And that's saying something.,positive
Daniel Craig is a great 007. watching this movie again on BD. Love the locations in this movie! torture scene is a bit much though.,negative
Best bond film so far. Stylishly done and a lot more sinister than its previous predecessors.,positive
"The whole franchise gets a massive kick start, and delivers a top-notch thrilling action drama that tops all the more entertaining of the Bond films and gives us so much more. It also harks back to the root core of Bond's character from the novels, and is only really beaten by On Her Majesty's Secret Service in comparison. Daniel Craig gives an outstanding performance, instantly believable and intensely dark, really how the character should be. If only Timothy Dalton had a film this good.",positive
"The scenery, action and acting were great but there was something missing as far as the storyline goes. I didn't dig it like the older Bond movies with the great Sean Connery. There's just something those older Bond movies have that's not captured in the newer ones.",negative
James Bond ne peut pas Ãªtre jouÃ© par un blonc.... Et Q a disparu!!!,negative
Craig is not a bad Bond. Mads Mikkelsen is a great Bond villan.,positive
Craig is right behind Connery as the best Bond..And that's with only one movie out. I can't wait for the next.,positive
I thought that this movie was very good but the end 20 minutes were a little much. I think that this is the best James Bond movie that I have seen. I did not like all the other ones with that one guy I did not enjoy those ones because i did not like the actor. This James Bond( Daniel Craig) was the best Bond so far.,positive
"The best Bond novel finally becomes the best Bond movie. Craig nails the tougher and human Bond that Fleming created, while also putting in new touches of his own. Very strong story due to its emphasis on character over action.",positive
"I was never too big on the James Bond series, and I didn't think that Daniel Craig had the right look for to be an Agent 007. Therefore, I ended up avoided this film when it was theatres. However, after I watched it on DVD, it became one of those films that I wished I had caught whilst still in the theatres. Suddenly, Mr. Bond felt like a new character ( which is no surprise, considering that this story focus on the secret agent at the beginning of his career) & absent were the schtick of the goofy sex-pot sidekicks & the cartoonish weaponry & the over the top comicbook-like villains bent on world domination. All that was left was the energetic action sequences ( still-high powered, yet still in the realm of logistical suspended belief that one walks into for a film such as this), international spy intrigue, antagonists of a more believable & sophisticated level & even an intricate romance sub-plot that reveals the mechanics of the mindset required to achieve the level of double-o seven. IMO, this is the James Bond movie for non-James Bond enthusiasts without sacrificing the heart & soul of loyal fans.",negative
"awesome approach to the latest James Bond movie. I actually found myself liking it, rather than just wanting to like it (which is what happened with some of the older ones)",positive
AHHHHHH MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!,positive
Quite disappointed by this 007 movie T__T,negative
"Good, not great. Craig is a good Bond.",positive
"Though Daniel Craig acting is without equivoc a classy one, the movie's scenario has spectacular action episodes like one would expect from any 007 movie, and though the image generally is stylish the movies suffers greatly from a few aspects which apparently were missed by many: 1)First of all what bothers me most, there are scenes in which a symbol like 007 is absolutely humiliated and maimed(scene where he's losing all 40 millions or so in one single poker hand being misled like an amateur;scene where he is tortured and beaten with a wet rope hit...you know where).... Things which I can't recall happening in neither the new series of 007 starring Pierce Brosnan nor the old classic with Sean Connery etc. 2)I think another chip in the great 007 iconic image is the way the character is performed by Daniel Craig, the new style/aura of Bond which doesn't fit the original character AT ALL - seeing him jump from the crane, blowing the embassy like a thug, those cranky fast moves...not bond at all, without Bond's touch of style, rather a triple X style... too bad",negative
Masses of product placement.Very little action and i hate remakes.The worst bond yet.,negative
"I really liked this movie. It was the best one I've seen at this point, but that could very well because it's only the 3rd or 4th one I've seen out of them all.",positive
"Bond re-invented, and it's pretty good really. You have to watch this film, forgetting the other 20-odd films that have come before it. A fresh start, and it works for me",positive
"one of the most hi-tech, action filled Bond films. this one's got it all.",positive
Easily the best James Bond movie in a while. Daniel Craig is more raw and real in the role than I thought possible.,positive
"Brilliant performance by Daniel Craig as the new Bond, he brings humour and great acting ability to this film.",positive
Probably the best 007 ever. Daniel Craig is almost as good James as Sean Connery.,positive
Time line doesn't work! Either set it in the present or make it the first. Don't try to do both.,negative
A terrific reinvention of the James Bond film franchise!,positive
Enjoyed this too. Is a great Bond. Don't usually like Bond but was v enjoyable. Refreshing change.,negative
always hated the bond films. at least daniel craig is fucking hot.,negative
"One of, if not THE, best Bond films.",positive
"So how, some way, this is the only Bond film I have ever watched. I don't know how I've managed to miss out on all 78 of them. But I liked this one. It had some solid action.",positive
Daniel makes a great Bond.,negative
"Good, but I miss Brosnan Bond.",positive
"Had my doubts, but turned out to be the best Bond film since Goldeneye in my opinion.",positive
"One of the best james bond yet,daniel craig is excellent .cant wait until the next bond movie.",positive
"Craig fills the shoes well, and I have to admit- the prequel stories we're getting for heroes in film did wonders to revive the stagnant pattern that Bond films were beginning to fall into again.",positive
"Too long? Yes, but the superfluous Venice shoot-out ending was pretty spectacular",positive
Casi se muere 007 xD,negative
pire James Bond de tous les temps,negative
"I think this is one of the best Bond movie to date. Bond is not a misogynist as in other Bond movies, and it shows the development of a 007 character. This is a deeper, darker and more thought provoking Bond movie.",positive
Great a classic James Bond movie although i preffered Pierce Brosman ( I think thats his name ),negative
"An incredibly good effort to restore the James Bond legacy that the past few Bond movies has tainted with more suspense and kudos to Daniel Craig on doing a good job as the new Bond. The ending was a bit strange, but not entirely disappointing.",positive
it may well be my favorite movie of all time,positive
"Easily one of the best Bond films. Craig is awesome, and its the first one not to feel like it's just trying to outdo the previous film. Tiny bit too long though.",positive
Good Plot and action,positive
"An ok action piece. It's not a Bond movie, though.",negative
"I need to see this movie again, I may have to give it another half star. A very solid start for a new bond. The Blu-ray Transfer is really great.",negative
"Welcome, Blond Bond.",positive
New story line was a good touch,positive
"I haven't seen any other James Bond movies, so i can't compare them, but I do love this movie. It's full of action and the song for the beginning credits is cool.",positive
i was never a Bond fan....this movie kills!!!!,positive
I can watch this movie over and over again with no problem.,positive
nice story...the best james bond movie...,positive
One of the best bond movies. Even if you dont care for Bond movies which I love you will like this movie. Infact if you dont like Bond movies you have a better chance of liking this movie than those big fans of us out there who still love Connery and Brosnan.,positive
BRILLIANT EXACTLY HOW IAN FLEMING INTENDED BOND TO BE,positive
One of the very best Bond's ever. Literally. Craig is the best Bond since Connery.,positive
This is my favorite James Bond movie of all time! The action is very good. Daniel Craig is one of the best Bond actors since Pierce Brosnan and Sean Connery! The Bond Girls are hot! Eva Green is one of my favorite Bond Girls of all time! I especially love the story between Bond and Vesper. Because this was different then the story when Bond proposed to Tracy,positive
"This was disappointing! I expected better, but was let down. This wasn't a bad film, just was boring and seemed rushed in it's delivery. I love the Bond films, but not this one. The girl must have been one of the director's girlfriends; you can tell by her acting! She should have never been picked as a Bond-girl; she sucked!",negative
"I expected more action from agent 007. Although I did enjoy seeing him more natural, a real human being (getting old), that sometimes was not able to jump as high as his counterpart. But I think they could still put more action, adrenaline ot it as they usually do.",negative
Best bond film in ages. Daniel Craig is a great bond despite my early worries.,positive
Terrific Bond movie!,positive
"I'm not really sure you can compare it to the other Bond movies but as a franchise reboot, Casino Royale is something special. Gritty, fast, action packed and ruthless, this is Bond for the Jack Bauer generation, stil exuding the effortless charm but now with a healthy dose of machismo thrown in. Craig is superb, as is the whole cast and the film itself with the emphasis on brains rather than machine guns and driving tanks through a city. It brings Bond back to being human....anbd makes him infinitely cooler. Casino Royale marks itself out as one of the finest movies of the decade.",positive
"A typical bond movie, a little bit long, but good.",negative
Me sorprendio el nuevo BOnd. La escena que le dan en los testiculos con una soga es increible!,positive
WOOh. Another shuaige. :D,positive
"I was always a great fan of 007 - action, a lot of adventures, etc. This film was different than others, it was really good!",positive
The best part is when he walks out of the water!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"This James Bond is real. This is what a secret agent is: unassuming in daily life, a great actor, cannon-fodder, multi-talented, cavalier about life, taking risks, dodging, bleeding, hurting, with a steel will to survive. And a real man to boot. This James Bond is actually sexy as opposed to everyone before him. Raw, realistic, and astoundingly courageous. Craig is the biggest asset to this film, which with magnificent pursuits, shots, venues and actors sans special gadgets popularized poker anew the whole world over.",positive
Couldn't make it past the sex torture. The bond series needs to be stabbed and killed for good like the perverted chauvinistic sex freak it is.,negative
The best movie EVER! James is so hot!,positive
"Wow, puts the Pierce Bronson movies to shame. Casino is alot darker than the previous movies. There is less corny bits, a lot of action and some great dramatic scenes. A reallly entertaining and well directed movie. Love that cel shaded intro. Execellent!",positive
The girl dies in the end,positive
"Wonderfully executed recapturing of the essence of Bond. The world's greatest spy had been hijacked these past years in The World is Not Enough, Tomorrow Never Dies and Die Another Day. Appeared dumbed down with numbingly homogonized American actresses with names that American audiences would recognize. Keep Bond exotic... and the Bond girls.",positive
"If anybody can come close to the likes of Mr. Connery, I'd have to say it's Daniel Craig. Not only did he rescue a drowning genre of film which had little support outside of it's established fan base, but he managed to create a new character in which we can all invest ourselves in. I think that's the most crucial thing he did: As much as Casino Royale is a bond movie, and it most certainly is, this newest installment has brought a new sense of appeal to a character who has been supported for decades, and by this point has brought many expectations along with it. Ladies and gentlemen, this newest Bond movie is for you, whoever you are. Daniel Craig, while carrying the reputation of the past behind him, doesn't buckle under the stress of the name ""Bond,"" and even manages to create a side of Bond that we as fans have never seen before. I think it is safe to say that Ian Fleming isn't rolling over in his grave just yet. Let's just hope this wasn't beginners luck.",positive
By a mile the best Bond film and the best Bond.,positive
enjoyed the actions! story is unpredictable & exciting.,negative
"Hmmm, I fell asleep...",negative
Best Jmaes Bond EVER,positive
"my first Bond movie and probably my last as well. I found the story bad, the action even worse (except for the getaway scene in the very beginning, this urban acrobacy is amazing)",negative
"Le meilleur des Bond actuels, tout simplement !",positive
"not my thing, but relatively well made",negative
"I like Bond but I don't worship him (this fact I think takes my IQ up by 2.5 points alone). But I wanted to really, really watch CS because the last Bond was never a Bond for me. Brosnan was too Remington Steele, too clean and nice, too tepid. Craig I wasnt sure about but I was willing to take a chance. And it turned out to be a chance worth taking; the film is fast-paced, clever, nicely shot. The slightly jarring aspect was the ""I love you"" that came out too quick and easy to Bond; amusing love track thankfully cut short by deception and a water grave.",negative
Best bond since Goldeneye!,positive
i stopped watching after first scenes.,negative
One of the best James Bond movies.,positive
(2) While this proves Bond can function sans gadgets... I still want Q back.,positive
perfect except for the cards during the poker scenes - plus last 20 minutes worked but it wasn't really necessary,positive
Best Bond since Connery.,negative
Daniel Craig is a great Bond.,positive
The first great James Bond movie.,positive
"I was skeptical about Daniel Craig being Bond (C'mon, a blond Bond?), but he's my favorite! When it comes to an action movie, this is a royal flush.",positive
One of the best James Bond films ever. Awaiting Quantum of Solace now!,positive
Good action and really as James Bond should be but last 30 minutes was totally unimportant.,negative
"Bond is back, and how. Nobody does it better than Sean Connery, but Danny is getting quite close. Stylishly Bond.",positive
Daniel Craig those shorts enough said,positive
"Damn, this is how you'd be if you really had a licence to kill. Best surprise of 2006. Made me forget all about the punny, pubescent preceding two Bond joints.",positive
my favorite Bond movie,positive
"i dont like this new james bond, he's like a little creepy monkey thing",negative
You must watch this..!!!!!!,positive
A slightly different bond007 movie from the rest....which is really interesting...and gives you some tips on how to read your opponents hand...in poker...,positive
best bond film in quite some time,positive
"As a Bond fan, I was disappointed that they don't go with someone like Clive Owen for the new Bond so I had a lot of skepticism going into this film but figured I'd give it a chance given all the great reviews. I was pleasantly surprised at Daniel Craig's performance - definitely a darker, postmodern take on the role which is probably a much needed shot in the arm to the franchise. Not as much action, besides the opening and closing scenes as most Bond films but overall a good flick. Will definitely check out the next film.",positive
Genial!!! Best Bond EVER!,positive
"Daniel Craig played the role well. Although not really the classic 007 role, Craig does a good job at playing the brand new double-o agent who makes mistakes. It really sets the stage as a great prequel to the full classic series.",positive
"This is how Bond was meant to be, and the director, screenwriter(s) and especially Daniel Craig got it exactly right. Craig plays him as a tough, hardened killer, but not without a heart. The action and stunts are excellent, the storyline is terrific without being too over-the-top... it's all good. Not simply one of the best Bond movies ever, but one of the best movies period of 2006.",positive
One of the greatest Bond films ever. Period.,positive
"Quite possibly the best Bond ever made. The opening scene is awesome. The action is as good as ever. I wasn't sure about Daniel Craig as 007, but wow was he good.",positive
The best James Bond in years (film and actor).,positive
The only Bond movie that I honestly feel like is an awesome movie AND an awesome Bond flick.,positive
"New Bond was a good pick, decent action, didn't care about the back-story much.",negative
Loved Daniel as Bond. He is just so damn rugged.,negative
un james bond tres atypique qui a les nerfs a vif et qui cogne dur beaucoup moins dandy que d habitude le film en lui meme repose tout sur l action car l intrigue reste tres legere le film est neanmoins assez bon,negative
Decent film for Daniel Craig. Did good job of being moody younger Bond.,positive
"After the appalling second half to Die Another Day, I was grateful for a return to the more traditional (Connery, Dalton) Bond.",negative
Daniel Graig is the best James Bond .....,positive
A return to form for 007...Daniel Craig is wicked in this!!,positive
The best Bond ever! More action and even a love story - plus the hot women. What else do you want in a movie.,positive
Restored the franchise at the right time.,positive
It was just plain good.,positive
I stayed awake during this Bond film and that's really saying something,negative
New james bond DC good job movie back to the roots of the old Sean Connery Days,positive
James Bond sans la couche de poussiere : le meilleur episode depuis Goldeneye.,negative
"Admittedly, Casino Royale is my first Bond film. I haven't had to sit through movie upon movie of femme fatales, crazy gadgets, and insane villains trying to destroy the world or whatever it is they do. Hence, I don't know how this actually stands up to the other 20 Bond films, I can only compare it by what I know based on the films' presence in pop culture. I have to say that I really, truly like this incarnation of Bond. There are no cheesy gadgets, crazy plots, or archetypal Bond girls running around waving guns while scantily clad. Casino Royale injects some cold, hard reality into the franchise and I fully applaud it for that move. And it doesn't hurt that Daniel Craig looks great without a shirt.",positive
pretty damn good i love james bond...this is one of the best ones next to goldfinger live and let die and goldeneye,positive
"def a 5 star movie!!! probably my favorite james bond movie made so far, and that's saying something. action-packed and thrilling! a must-see!!!",positive
"really sweet. I still like Pierce better, but Bond is sweet.",positive
A masterpiece. The best James Bond I've seen.,positive
Your not my type. what? smart? no...Single.,positive
The best 007 film and one the best films of 2006.,positive
"[font=Verdana][size=2]Aside from a wretched third act that struggles because of wild emotional leaps in the plot, Casino Royale is a solid back-to-basics for the Bond series. When he's not dodging lines in the first hour of the film (I believe he only had about 20), Daniel Craig is bringing back a brash, smug, and rough-edged appearance to the character of James Bond. No, Bond hasn't lost any of his womanizing ability (he actually manages to crank that up a notch as well), but this version of Bond is one that is worth remembering. While Daniel Craig is a main reason why Casino Royale is one of the better Bond films of late, and perhaps ever, the general appearance of the film is another strength. Gone is the annoying reliance on gadgets and contraptions that help Bond navigate through extremely unrealistic odds. True,[/size][/font][font=Verdana][size=2] defibrillating oneself in a parking lot and returning to a game of high-stakes poker is pretty unrealistic, but there is a fine line between that and some of the tomfoolery of the Brosnan-era Bond flicks. [img]http://www.the-reel-mccoy.com/movies/2006/images/CasinoRoyale_3.jpg[/img] Alright, now that all the back-patting for being a good Bond movie is taken care of, let's move towards an actual analysis of the film. The pacing is quite an issue, but the highs are certainly high. The opening chase scene, featuring some dude who I'm convinced was the stunt double for Spiderman, is quite astounding and especially hilarious considering it could've all been avoided if Bond's associate wasn't such an idiot. Bond's progression throughout the first act in general is pitch-perfect, and the second act begins with a wonderful exchange between Craig's Bond and Moneypenny, played by the extremely gorgeous Eva Green. While the actual high-stakes poker game drags and some of the hands played are ludicrous, the film still maintains. Then it almost goes to shit. To protect all five of you who haven't seen this film yet, I will refrain from going into details about the problems with the story's direction in the third act, but let's just say it's unbelievable given the character types. I know this is supposed to be the beginning of Bond and a prelude to who he is and blah blah blah, but none of it fits given the characters' mentalities prior. Thankfully, the hiccup is not dwelt upon at the end, which is actually fantastic (and when I say end, I mean [i]very[/i] end). All in all, Casino Royale is a worthy reentry to this series/genre and appropriately whets the appetite for Quantum of Solace.[/size][/font]",negative
went prepared to not enjoy it - completely won over. Sorry Pierce.,positive
It was a little too long for my liking... but it was great!,positive
The best James Bond ever!,positive
one of my favorite bond movies,positive
One of the best James Bond movies!,positive
awwwww daniel craig ill be your new bond girl,positive
Daniel Craig has quickly become a top Bond. One of the best chases ever at the start & was on foot. Judi Dench's best role yet as M.,positive
excellent...a must see and a well needed change for the bond franchise,positive
"Jahérna, þetta er bara ágætis spennumynd - ekki ágætis Bond mynd heldur ágætis mynd.",negative
"Badass movie, and the chick in this one was super sexy",positive
"Was ok, was a bit long for my taste but it was alright.",negative
"Huh... I just realized I never actually sat down, from very beginning to very end, and actually watched this movie. I watched it last night, and lost about 2 hours of sleep because of it. It was a great story (especially for Bond) and it was well acted, with an interesting cast and excellent direction. Excellent movie, but it lacked a few things ""Bond"", some good, some bad. Good missing Bond segments: There's no, thank God, over the top, ridiculous plot to take over the world. This one is much more real, more conceivable, and really puts a personality to our beloved British spy. Bad missing Bond segment: Gadgets. The movie felt less Bond without the interesting little devices that got him out of tough situations... but he was still clever, so whatever. All in all, its a really well done flick that I thoroughly enjoyed. The ending was very lackluster (was the first Bond movie that was entirely self contained?) but maybe if Quantum of Solace is as good (it has the potential to be better) I won't care.",positive
Daniel Craig makes an awesome Bond. The storyline is not as corny as all the other Bond movies.,positive
AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
la serie bonds muy buena.,positive
"Never been a fan of the campy aspects of the James Bond series; so as one of the few people who's favourite Bond was Timothy Dalton, I welcome this return to a more serious interpretation. I really enjoyed it, but it loses a star for the lengthy poker and romance scenes, and a slightly unsatisfying ending.",positive
"Liked it alot. Im not a fan of classic bond films, guess thats why I liked this one.",positive
"Really surprisingly shockingly pleasantly-surprisingly good! Altho him providin himself with the defibulator, im afraid that was just a touch too far-fetched! The rest was just like a documentary!",positive
THE NAMES BOND... JAMES BOND,positive
the new James Bond is so cooooooooool!!,positive
"yes, daniel craig is the best bond since connery, but the film is actually good, too. that's right, i said film. it's one bond movie that can actually stand on its own without the franchise propping it up. then again, i'm a fan of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service.""",negative
Pretty good but nothing too special.,negative
"daniel craig is a great bond with great potential, cant wait for his second appearance as bond. This film has transformed the Bond franchise. It is much more of a drama than just an action thriller. The character development is quadrupled compared with other Bond movies. It also portrays a much more flawed and human Bond. Having said that, the ...action sequences are still of the highest quality. Can't wait for the next one!!",positive
scary-but good-my favorite of the bond movies,positive
"The best bond film ever! Yes, am totally biased cos of Daniel Craig, but this was the first film I saw him in. Not like other Bond films or other bonds, he's rough and sexy and charismatic.",positive
"A very good Bond film with some extremely impressive moments (the opening sequence is incredible). Unfortunately it is extremely uneven. I wish they hadn't replace baccarat with Texas Hold'em (it made a potentially classy moment appear to be an excerpt from the World Series of Poker). But the biggest short fall is the last 30 minutes or so. It drags and is extraordinarily predictable. The film as a whole is a huge upgrade over ""The World is Not Enough"" and ""Die Another Day."" It is definitely worth watching.",negative
best james bond movie i've seen..so far,positive
Best Bond in years - Looking forward to Quantum Of Solace.,positive
"Much like the rest of the internet in 2006, when he was first announced, I was not at all confident in Daniel Craig as James Bond. But once he started bashing scum's heads into bathroom sinks and crashing through walls, I was all on board for James Bond as monster. There's a little less winky charm to him than Connery's Bond, but he has all the animal of the assassin. Casino Royale has the epic scope required for this Batman Begins not-really-a-reboot flick, and even though it meanders a little bit too much in the middle, it is a great start for the new millennium's double o. And weepy Mads Mikkelsen a great, classic villain. Not VF.",negative
"Excellent Bond film. Focus on spies, gambling and just feels like a 'proper' Bond film without these crazy psycho bad guys like recent attempts. Daniel Craig does a good job as James Bond. Would've liked more Q gadgets (without going over the top), but a good film breathing new life into the franchise.",positive
"The best Bond I've ever seen. The plot was cool, loses a few points for the poker seen taking too long, but generally it was Bond all over and every action scene was very carefully crafted and its obvious. My introduction to parkour too. Fascinating.",positive
007 doesn't fall in love. i don't want to know why he doesn't fall in love....again.,positive
Bondgasm! I'm speechless. Best Bond since Goldeneye which co-incidently was Campbell's last Bond film in which he broke in Brosnan. Campbell knows what he's doing.,positive
I love the nods to Bond cliches!,positive
Two words: Daniel Craig!,positive
The best James Bond film since Sean Connery.,positive
It was ok...held my attention some of the time.,negative
"so good i cant contain myself, cant wait until october.",positive
"i don't even like Bond movies, this was stellar. I like Daniel Craig and poker so this was a great combo for me.",positive
"guns, hot women, poker, whats not to like",positive
"No more mister nice guy. The movie was deeper, cooler and crueler than the previous ones. It had realism to it that the other Bonds lacked. OH, and Daniel Graig IS HOT!",positive
cant wait for new bond movie,positive
I love Bond movies and I was a little worried about Daniel Craig being the new bond but uhhh it was awesome!,positive
Completely ruins James Bond.,negative
"pretty bad ass. i liked daniel craig as the new bond, and the enemy was played perfectly. mads mikellson (butchered his last name) had the perfect look, accent, and demeanor to play the bad guy. and it had a really hot bond girl. another good bond movie.",positive
"I have to say, I'm a James Bond fan, not just someone who jumped on when this film came out. Even as a person who has loved these movies for a while, this film stands tall as the best Bond film of them all. Daniel Craig OWNS this role now. I loved Sean Connery, Timothy Dalton(License to Kill baby!) and Pierce Brosnan, but Craig is the only actor that was PERFECT as James Bond, in my humble opinion. The raw, intensity coupled with his vulnerabiltiy made him seem like a real person. Eva Green is witty, sexy, and smart as Bond's only true love, Vesper Lynd and the action sequences(the bomb-maker chase, the airport), the sharp James Bond wit(""Oh I'm sorry; that last hand...nearly killed me"") and even the poker scenes were awesome thanks to the funny tension between Bond and arch nemesis, Le Cheffre. The greatest James Bond film and one of the best films of 2006 will be hard to beat by its direct sequel, Quantum of Solace, this November.",positive
Best Bond film in Years!,positive
"Ok I know it's not perfect, but it really did reinvent Bond, and I can't wait to see where they go next. Oh, and it's got Daniel Craig in it. Even rubbish films with Daniel Craig in them are worth watching, and this is a good film with Daniel Craig in it. The freerunning sequence early on is just great entertainment.",positive
A quality reinvention of the genre with a little more depth.,positive
"Daniel Craig is now the second best James Bond, and Casino is the second best Bond movie.",positive
Superb start for Daniel Craig as James Bond.,positive
A fantastic reboot with the best Bond since Connery.,positive
bond james bond !!! yey,positive
great story and a lot of action. plus it doesnt hurt that james bond is super sexy.,positive
pretty good for Daniel Kraig's 1st bond film!,positive
finally a badass Bond!,negative
"Best Bond film, yet!!",positive
thj ebest bond movie for ages and fuckin luvly aston martin,positive
"This was the best Bond movie that I've ever seen. If I had known how good it was going to be, I would have been there opening night. I will definately be there for opening night of Quantum of Solace.",positive
Tres fidele au roman de Ian Fleming mais aussi tres decale,positive
Daniel Craig as James Bond!? Holy crap. Better than that Scottish fucker....Sean something...?,positive
"I finally got to watch this on Showtime the other night. REALLY enjoyed it. Daniel Craig was a great Bond - he really exposed a human side to the character. The chase scenes and the women in the film were more than up to previous Bond standards, and newer films such as the Italian Job. Great movie!!",positive
"Bond is effectively rebooted into the 21st century with this first-rate updating of the Ian Fleming book. This movie actually improves on the Fleming source material. Daniel Craig is the first actor since Connery to define the roll of James Bond from his first appearance and, provided the Broccoli's can keep giving him scripts as good as ""Casino Royale""s, then Craig may surpass Connery as THE definitive screen Bond. A",positive
one of the best bond films yet,positive
And we doubted Craig for so long...,positive
"Not a huge Bond guy, but this was a strong piece of work.",positive
"Brilliant, what can i say- Daniel Craig in those shorts, hubba hubba!!",positive
Finally Bond has some mongrel in him,positive
"This was good, Love Daniel Graig totally right to play Bond, some action scenes good. But I guess I'd have to watch it again to get into it again.",negative
"Really enjoyed the new reboot of Bond. Thought Daniel Craig was brilliant, he concentrated more on the cold, clinical, ego-maniac side of Bond than the wisecracking, smirking Bond that others have portrayed. This Bond is harder, meaner, faster and has more layers as a character. The story was brill although I felt that the last 30 minutes could have been condensed a bit. Eva Green is great, although I'm a big fan of hers either way. Favourite part had to be the chase scene as the beginning of the film that takes us through a construction site, up a crane, and ends with a kick-arse explosion at the embassy. Action gold.",negative
"Its a fake, sorry its my worst james bond film. Its a pity. I dont know, it was lacking a lot of scientific inventions and technology.",negative
An excellent film. Classic Bond.,positive
Loved the poker game!! Could be the best Bond movie in recent times!!,positive
I really think this movie brings back the feel of the old James Bond films. It wasn't so over the top.,positive
I have good memories associating to this movie which makes me like it even more,negative
"When Daniel Craig was selected to take over as 007 from Pierce Brosnan, there was a strong worldwide protest, as many Bond fans felt that Craig was not right to play the dashing, debonair, Martini-sipping, DARK HAIRED superspy. ""Casino Royale"" proved the detractors (including this writer) wrong. Despite Craig's being the first and only blonde Bond, he demonstrated superb acting chops, while handling the toughest action scenes. This re-boot of the Bond Franchise shows the origins of the newly-promoted 007 and portrays Bond as a raw, rash and emotional secret agent.",positive
"Forget about people who say "" the best Bond since.... this or that "". This is the best Bond film... ever. No question. Action is electric and plentiful considering it's meant to be all about playing poker !",positive
"What makes this film so great is the ability to tell the beginning of Bond's life. but what i think what makes this film a bit bad is all the the gadgets and Money Penny taken out of the plot, a rather realistic and gritty story line to capture the mood of Novels this reinvention restores your faith in the Spy genre. there was some really good acting by the new james bond daniel craig and also good acting by eva green , judi dench and Mads Mikkelsen. this is one of the best bond films i have seen but it is not the best 007 film i have seen.",positive
Finally a Bond movie one can actually enjoy! Daniel Craig IS James Bond.,positive
"at first I thought 'wow, they picked THAT to be the new Bond?' but in the end, he kicked ass. didnt need any real lame gadgets. he just kicked their asses which was sweet",positive
"The poker goes on WAY too long, and the ending is slow, but it's still a damn good film.",positive
"it was ok, but i dont like daniel craig as bond",negative
The best Bond film by far.,positive
worst james bond ever!!,negative
Bond gets better - about f'kin time!,negative
"<i>""Any thug can kill. I need you to take your ego out of the equation.""</i> <p> <i>Casino Royale</i> denotes the 21st official entry to the James Bond cinematic pantheon (three unofficial Bond films are also in existence - two earlier versions of <i>Casino Royale</i>, and another version of <i>Thunderball</i> entitled <i>Never Say Never Again</i> with Sean Connery). To the die-hard 007 aficionados, 2002's somewhat atrocious <i>Die Another Day</i> indicated the immediate death of James Bond. The film wasn't warmly received in spite of grossing $450 million at the international box office. As a consequence, EON productions returned to the drawing board to devise an alternative strategy to re-invent Bond and rescue the filmic franchise that had endured for forty years. During the four-year space between <i>Die Another Day</i> and 2006's <i>Casino Royale</i>, EON must've noticed the remarkably successful <i>Batman Begins</i> - a reboot of the Batman cinematic franchise, resurrecting a character that had died in the unspeakably appalling <i>Batman & Robin</i>. EON productions had acquired the rights to Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel - <i>Casino Royale</i> - and ultimately opted to take the opportunity to reboot the Bond cinematic franchise. From the outset, the objective was to offer a far more compelling, brutal antihero and a faithful embodiment of the Ian Fleming character. Back in 1995, the world beheld a modernised James Bond in <i>GoldenEye</i> (arguably the best in the franchise since <i>Goldfinger</i>). Directed by Martin Campbell and starring Pierce Brosnan in the title role, the film successfully transplanted the classic character to a post-Cold War setting. It re-ignited the Bond series which alas subsequently died again with <i>Die Another Day</i>. EON productions were desperate for the Bond film franchise to continue, and their last hope was <i>Casino Royale</i>. Quentin Tarantino had expressed interest in helming an adaptation of Fleming's novel, however his wish was denied. Instead Martin Campbell was chosen to direct (as he had effectively resurrected the series once beforehand), and Daniel Craig was selected as James Bond. <i>Casino Royale</i> has been described as the most faithful cinematic appropriation of an Ian Fleming 007 novel. Gone is the suave womanising, the endearing one-liners, the charm and the fascinating gadgets. Sure, the creators wanted the series to be closer to the Ian Fleming novels, but following forty years of the appealing ""Classic Movie Bond"" formula it frankly feels like too little, too late. Throughout the early 21st century the world was introduced to numerous action heroes barely individual from one another. Craig's rougher Bond fails to differentiate himself in the field of action heroes today. What originally set Bond apart from the rest was his style, his wit, the sex and the class... All of which has vanished. In addition to paying attention to <i>Batman Begins</i> as a way to revive a classic franchise, it seems EON also noticed the smartest espionage action-thrillers ever made - the Jason Bourne series. To keep Bond alive for a modern generation, Bond has been transformed into an emotionless thug - a fundamental clone of Jason Bourne (interestingly, Gary Powell is responsible for the stunts in <i>The Bourne Ultimatum</i> after he was hired for this film). Yes, this is Fleming's Bond, but it's lacking a compelling story. The emotionless Jason Bourne movies work because of the story that keeps viewers engaged. In this case, the mishmash of a brutal thug with a flippant Bond narrative is jarring. It lacks the charming ""Film Bond"" elements, and therefore fails to emerge as separate from the Bourne series. <i>Casino Royale</i> also lulls a tad too much with its emaciated plot flattened out into an action/adventure film with a distinct lack of momentum. Towards the end of its 140-minute runtime it contains a number of anticlimaxes that go on forever. The subdued villainy (more of a fault of Fleming's novel...but it's still a fault carried over to the film) is less interesting and less menacing. <i>Casino Royale</i> could have been far worse, but it also could've been far better. <center><i>""I have no armour left. You've stripped it from me. Whatever is left of me - whatever is left of me - whatever I am - I'm yours.""</i></center> <br> As for the film's plot, James Bond (Craig) has just earned his Double-0 status. At MI6, M (Dench) sees Bond's potential and is aware that he's the best card player in the service. Bond is sent to the Casino Royale in Montenegro to play a high-stakes poker game against Le Chiffre (Mikkelsen); a banker to the world's terrorists. If Bond wins and bankrupts Le Chiffre, it will destroy his terrorist organisation. M places Bond under the vigilant eye of the beguiling Vesper Lynd (Green). Fleming's Casino Royale novel isn't as sexy, tense or action-packed as the other jazzier Bond novels. Apart from the obligatory action scenes (of which are very limited) all Bond needs to do is play cards and win. The premise just isn't as strong as the other Bond films/novels. Typical Bond screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade are joined by Paul Haggis; a man responsible for <i>Crash</i> and <i>Million Dollar Baby</i>. The script works well throughout the kinetic first half in particular. However, at times during the second half there are moments of dialogue entirely improper in a Bond setting. The film even alludes to Macbeth! It may seem clever to insert Oscar-winning moments of drama, but in an action/adventure movie it doesn't work...it's cringe-worthy. There are incalculable other flaws in the screenplay. For example, the novel approach of gritty realism is abandoned during moments that are utterly preposterous. Bond is shown as a vulnerable human, yet it'd be impossible for anyone to survive some parts of the furious action scenes. For example: at a time during the opening foot-chase he falls onto a metal surface before rolling onto the ground. If he was ""human"" he'd have fractured a rib or two. And Bond runs almost non-stop during the opening chase. No matter how fit he is no-one can run for that long. The most substantial insult to the realism approach is the combined fault of the screenwriters and those behind the camera. A car swerves to avoid hitting someone, consequently rolling around in the air several times. It's physically impossible for any car to dance around in the air like that in this certain context. Bond also survives this massive car wreck. If he was ""human"" he'd have broken a few bones and his organs would be in trouble. But no - a few scratches is all suffers. Uh huh... <center><i>""Arrogance and self-awareness seldom go hand in hand.""</i></center> <br> In tradition with the Bond films, the location filming (Italy, Montenegro, Bahamas, England, Czech Republic) is striking. Director Martin Campbell is masterful at setting the required atmosphere. For the amazing pre-title sequence there's a moody atmosphere. <i>Casino Royale</i> is one of the gloomiest Bond films in existence, containing much blood, brutal punches and a high body count. The violence has a more British neo-noir spark to it. The film is even reportedly the first in the franchise to feature rain. The action scenes rattle along at a furious pace, and the card-playing (while excessively dragged out to monotony) is lensed with consummate dexterity. The stunts are utterly superb. All the fights (reminiscent of Jason Bourne) are brutal, rough and riveting. To accompany this, David Arnold's exhilarating score radically accelerates the pacing. There are a few miscalculations with the action, unfortunately; the collapsing building in Venice is a gimmick too far in an emotional finale which would play better without all the noise. <center><i>""I'm sorry. That last hand... nearly killed me.""</i></center> <br> Most controversial during the film's production period was Daniel Craig as James Bond. He's a wooden, stiff, emotionless assemblage of muscles. In this single movie alone he spends more time with his shirt off than any other actor portraying the role combined! To be honest he looks like a slightly ham-fisted attempt at woodworking. Craig's head is a rough cube, sawed and sanded, with the blue eyes hammered in like nail heads. He looks right at home handling the action scenes and beating opponents to a pulp, but he occasionally falters while delivering dialogue. Also, when the writers offer him humour to deliver, he sounds forced. As the sixth actor to play James Bond in the official films, Craig doesn't have the ruggedness or cheek of Sean Connery, the charming dapperness of Roger Moore, nor the playful and debonair grace of Pierce Brosnan. But his portrayal is superior to the less popular Timothy Dalton and George Lazenby. <i>Casino Royale</i> is expected to be the first of three or four Bond adventures featuring Daniel Craig as the beloved spy. Eva Green is outstandingly beautiful and impossibly well-dressed as the Bond girl of the picture. Judi Dench immediately won the heart of Bond fans when she debuted as M in 1995's <i>GoldenEye</i>. To be honest, M seems pretty useless here. She begs Bond to stop his silly investigation before begging for his help. M is quite poorly written in the film. Jeffrey Wright features as 007's traditional CIA contact, Felix Leiter. A black Felix may appear somewhat peculiar to some, but Wright is just right for the part (excuse the pun) and is spot-on believable. Mads Mikkelsen is barely menacing, nor is he remarkable as the film's primary villain. Memorable villains are a necessity for Bond films, but Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre is tragically underwhelming. This is a fault of adhering to the original Fleming novel. Whatever makes the novel enthusiasts happy, I suppose. Overall, <i>Casino Royale</i> is a decent action-adventure film and a solid revitalisation of everyone's favourite British secret agent. The film stalls and is indeed too long at about 140 minutes (the longest in the franchise's history), and there's a sappy lacklustre section towards the film's conclusion, but at least there's sufficient time for character exploration and the action is predominantly amazing. <br> <center><i>""The name's Bond... James Bond.""</i></center>",negative
"I'm having a hard time finding something wrong with this movie. It's intense, intelligent, and all the while very intimate; Casino Royale never takes an easy way out. Daniel Craig and Judi Dench prove to be perfect for their roles, rendering me absolutely impatient to see the next in the series. It sort of lacks the grandeur to push itself into general perfection, but as far as action movies go, you really can't do any better than Casino Royale. Note: Upon first viewing, be prepared to shout 'Oh, snap!' or an equivalent phrase multiple times throughout the movie.",positive
Loved every second of it...,positive
better than expected,negative
"Awesome. First Bond movie I've ever seen, but I loved it.",positive
"My favorite Bond movie of all time...The same formula from Batman of showing how the hero began and it works! Craig was a gutsy, smart choice!",positive
"Thank GOD we're back to GOOD Bond movies with an even BETTER Bond! I liked Pierce, but THIS guy is like mixing Sean Connery's cold and dashing killing machine with Pierce's sly and cool Bond. Woot! And the plot wasn't too bad either, with great action scenes, basic gadgetry (leaves him to fend for himself more) and GREAT cars. All in all, I loved it! GO SEE IT!",positive
"Quality movie in its own right, rewritten the rules of Bond movies and in a good way. Awesome.",positive
two words. daniel craig. nobody else does dirty bond like him.,positive
wasn't expecting 2 like it but did and was very impressed,positive
"Une scÃ¨ne d'intro Ã  couper le souffle !!! Et vive Daniel Craig, il est sombre Ã  souhait.",positive
first james bond movie i've ever seen! it was alright.,negative
Bond has never been this good!!,positive
daniel craig completely revitalized the bond franchise. the grittiest bond since lazenby.,positive
Long movie... I only started to enjoy it halfway in. best part was how well it showed him changing.,positive
"I proclaim Daniel Craig my favourite Bond.....bold call i am sure but i like his brooding, flawed presence",positive
"I'm afraid that although this was a good film, it really was a Bond film. Why change the formula? If you don't like Bond, watch something else. James Bond hasn't become a icon for years for nothing. Still, it's a great film with some fantastic action. The grittiness is good, but again would have been better in a different film. There was no reason this had to be a Bond film other than riding the namesake. Well and the fact that it was based on the book, but that's a minor detail to Hollywood anyway! :p",negative
Pfft fucking amazing hands down.,positive
"Hated it when I saw it in the cinema but grown to like it with subsequent viewings. As a stand alone film its pretty good, but I dont like it as a Bond film.",negative
enfin un vrai james bond,positive
If Dr. No could be replaced as the best Bond film... If Sean Connery could be replaced as the best James Bond...,positive
really good movie best james bond ever,positive
Excellent reboot for a dying franchise,positive
I love the running scene at the beginning. Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond.,positive
"Best Bond ever! Craig is the king, looking forward to the next instalment. Bond is well and truly back!",positive
James Bond formula still works --- both old and new austin make an appearance,positive
"Great movie, action packed and great addition to the Bond franchise. Daniel Craig is the best 007 next to Connery. He brings a depth to the character that is more faithful to the original concept that Ian Flemming intended Bond to be.",positive
"If I reviewed this purely as an action movie, then I'd say it was pretty good, BUT, as a Bond movie; no good at all. In this film Bond is lower class and far from smooth. The various send ups throughout the movie of classic Bond cliches just make it worse and the ending where he's not only fallen in love, but had been duped by her to boot, was as far away from the true Bond as you can get.",negative
"Daniel Craig is fantastic. Eva Green is gorgeous. It's the kind of action movies anyone can love because it's equally as smart and well crafted. The dialogue was perfect. Bond music fit to the tea. Even the villian had a fucked up eye. Anything Jeffrey Wright is in, I'm there. I just wish he had a larger role. This film takes place before Bond has become his usual self. He is weakened by ego, passion, and love. Watch him learn his lesson, and survive through some of the craziest shit ever. If only I wasn't clumsy as fuck, i would want to be a spy.",positive
I think that this is probably my favorite of all the Bond films. It takes on the genre with an authentic patina but without the corny feel of its forerunners. This movie is serious about character development.,positive
Great Action Movie! But He is not James Bond. I was very disappointed with his portrayal of Bond.,positive
Probably my favorite Bond movie as I really enjoyed Daniel Craig as a more serious and tortured version of Bond.,positive
"This was the worst Bond movie I have ever seen, not because of the plot, but because of Daniel Craig. He did an okay acting job, but what happend to the tall, dark hair, and dark-eyed Bond? Daniel Craig is short, blond, and blue-eyed. He would have been better as a Bond villian.",negative
Great film...It's no Licence To Kill though!,positive
"I think I'm probably the only person who found this movie to be boring. If I wanted to watch a poker game I would have just turned on the TV....I have since seen this movie again, I liked it a lot better this time around. I was never bored the second time.",positive
"The movie that got me hooked on the franchise. Very much a hardcore Bond, like he should be. A great rebooting of the series with a nice combination of espiaonage, women, action, thrills, mystery, and poker: the elements we all know of James Bond. I think Daniel Craig did a great job. However, I didn't like how Q or Mrs. Moneypenny weren't in it, but I do understand that without them, the movie has a more serious tone, but they are key members in the franchise and should not have been cut. I also that it was odd that the key villain, was killed off, just like that, and James wasn't even the one to do it. However, the filmakers did a good job of delivering a rebooting of a successful franchise and a great origin story of one of the most iconic movie characters.",positive
Best James Bond flick ever! Daniel Craig is the best Bond...sorry Connery.,positive
"Supberb action, one of the best action Bond film to date.",positive
"The bond franchise gets the fresh lick of paint which it deserves and who better to play the double 0 Agent than Daniel Craig. With the gadgets and Money Penny taken out of the plot, a rather realistic and gritty story line to capture the mood of Novels this reinvention restores your faith in the Spy genre. With superb well executed Action Scenes and well developed Stunt work this is the best vision of Bond by far- those of you not seen it yet do so before the release of next entitled Quantum Of Solace, released in early November.",positive
Bond reimagined as it was always intended to be. Excellent.,positive
No bond feeling. Could have been nice if not part of bond frenchaise.,negative
"Wow, that was way better than I thought it could be. After Goldeneye, the writers of James Bond have been trying to find new and unusual ways to make the Bond series synonymous with complete shit. However, this movie, with a new Bond and new, more practical plot, impressed me enough to have faith in James Bond once again.",positive
"Deconstructing Bond. Very solid. Very good, with layers the ""original"" Bonds lack.",positive
A crackerjack reinterpretation of a classic antihero.,positive
"The first time I watched this was with suspect interest on an airplane flight to Florida. And I was disappointed. The smooth, charming, and ass-kicking Bond I knew had been replaced with a cold, glib, and somewhat hamfisted phony. Where was all the guns? Explosions? Impossible human athletics? Unrealistic plot developments? The Bond I knew had died. The second time I watched the film, I realized that the old Bond was gone for good, and gone for the good. What it lacks in action it makes up for with extensive character development, which is really what Bond REALLY needs after nearly 30 years of trite and predictable plots. The script was believable, and far more intriguing than most of the other films of the franchise. The villain wasn't some megalomaniacal psuedo-genius hellbent on ruling or destroying the world, but a cunning and surly arms dealer facing pressure and enemies on all sides. The only nit to pick is the over-explanation of poker terms. Come on - most people know about bluffs and tells, even those of us who don't even play poker. Overall, though, a film surprisingly different than most movies of the franchise, and surprisingly better.",positive
AWESOME MOVIE.And really fun to look at...,positive
very good 007 movie just needed a little more gadgetry but it was a more realistic take on the series,positive
Pourquoi il est blond au yeux bleu ... le james bond a toujours été brun au yeux brun !!!!!!,negative
"Talk about a thrilling ride for a movie. Unfortunately, it was a little bit of a disapointment compared to many of the original James Bond movies with Sean Connery. Still a very well done movie with tons of action and back stabbing!",negative
Bond is back and at his best!!!,positive
A big bond fan and this is very good,positive
Have now watched it again and have decided that I really like it! Not just because Daniel Craig is in it!!,positive
"For me, the best Bond film yet, because it's different.",positive
Up tell this point the Bond movies bored me to the point of near death. I hope the next one is as good.,positive
"best bond movie ever, craig fits in perfectly",positive
"J'aime beaucoup Daniel Craig en James Bond, mais l'histoire de ce volet reste definitivement en dessous des premiers avec Sean Connery.",negative
"I love the Bond franchise. Even the ultra-terrible ones (I'm looking at you, Dalton) have something that I fully and completely enjoy. This, however, had the whole package. It is one of the best 007 movies from all 40+ years that they've been making them.",positive
"The franchise is reborn. While less comedic than Sean Connery, Craig brings a certain mysterious something to the table that has been missing since the initial installments of the series. Most of the usual 007 contrivances updated for the Aughts are here and even though I usually despise the Bruckheimeresque let's blow it up mentality, this one pulls it off. Action packed baby.",negative
"""Casino Royale"" is the bomb. Although there really aren't that many bombs in the movie. Which is precisely why this James Bond IS the bomb. Hand-to-Hand Combat > Bombs = This Bond, James Bond, is the bomb.",positive
The best james bond character but story was different to the book.,positive
"I had my doubts about Daniel Craig. After seeing this one, I doubted no more!",positive
Best bond ever! No gadgets and giggly floozies with dumb names. Eagerly awaiting the next installment.,positive
Daniel Craig has provided the Bond series with renewed vigor in this well-made installment.,positive
"Craig is the best bond there ever will be...everything in this film was FLAWLESS. Martin Campbell perfected the pace of the action and plot, and all the main characters were very well developed. The film had me stuck from the opening credits when Bond receives his double-O status, right down to the very end when he uses his catch phrase. The only thing I regret is that Bond totaled the Aston Martin before he had a chance to use it:(",positive
"Awesome. Lots of people get beat up and some things blow up and Bond is, well, Bond, and Eva Green is in it, so.",positive
"I was pleasantly surprised by how well-done this movie was. My interest in James Bond had waned down in the years because although the slick spy is awesome to watch, sometimes the gadgets and the unbelievable villains make it hard to sit through them. But thank you Martin Campbell for giving the Bond series a needed shot of adrenaline and intensity. Many of the action scenes were downright intense and I felt my heart pacing throughout the whole film. The film was refreshing in its darker portrayal of bond and his adventures, twisting all over the place before coming to an end. However, as cool as Daniel Craig is, he still doesn't feel as right in the part of Bond as others.",positive
lovely film lovely scenes.... i liked it a lot...,positive
Best Bond EVER!!! Even compared to Goldfinger!,positive
Suprisingly decent...,positive
Not a bad Bond film if I do say so myself,positive
"A rougher, tougher Bond who actually stepped away from his job for a woman. Amazing, and...also very un-Bond-like. However, some of the usual elements, gadgets, and characters carry over from the previous films. Plus, Craig is one of the few Bonds who look good outside of the tux.",negative
Everything was great except the huge poker screwup. Table stakes game and a guy goes broke when he has everyone covered 10-1,negative
the best james bond film. this is a brand-new james bond. he fell and failed. plus daniel craig's doing a great job.,positive
"Vesper Lynd: ""Am I going to have a problem with you, Mr. Bond?"" James Bond:"" No, don't worry, you're not my type."" Vesper Lynd: ""Smart?"" James Bond: ""Single.""",positive
""" a great and NEW edition to the 007 films""",positive
"I love this film, Daniel Craig in my oppinion is the best bond since Connery, actually he beats Connery. I really enjoyed this film, and I can't wait to see the sequal.",positive
ce james bond est mieux que les autres selon moi... plus d'humour et d'action,positive
"I absolutely loved this film. It's the best of the Daniel Craig Bond films, with ""Skyfall"" right on it's heels. Basically, you could say they're 1A and 1B. Mads Mikkelsen is the perfect villain. How that guy isn't in more roles, is beyond me. He's outstanding in the NBC series ""Hannibal""'as well. Casino Royale is definitely the sleekest of all the Bond films and those opening chase scenes with all of the parkour, is jaw-dropping. I'm partial to poker, so it's almost a perfect film for me. From the cars, to the beautiful resorts in the Bahamas, to the luxurious Casinos, it's quite the flick. Open a bottle of Bollinger and enjoy the ride...",positive
"5 stars, if only for the Aston Martin....",positive
I like The new Bond but there was too much drama and boredom. Whenever there was action though it was cool.,negative
Plot was somewhat ponderous but the action scenes were quite convinving. Liked the collapsing building in Venice.,positive
rather in depth for a james bond movie. well done. enjoyable. hope to see a sequal.,positive
I was not thrilled about there being a new Bond but was pleasantly surprised!,positive
James Bond modern. kerreeenn,positive
finally a bond worth franchising,positive
A true revival of the Bond series.,positive
"From the beginning, you knew this was going to be a different James Bond. Much more hand to hand, cockier, and naive. Daniel Craig is my Bond.",positive
"On the more serious side of James Bond, which was both disappointing and a nice change. Some great action, particularly the opening scenes. Also the shortest car chase in Bond history, methinks. Craig was quite good, and I did like the story, and the poker.",negative
i always love james bond movie. ..,positive
"no freakin' hot women, no plot, no nothin'...they don't even put the technology in the right era...>(",negative
"I never was a big James Bond fan, but this is one great movie. Daniel Craig is fabulous and inhabits the role to the point of making me forget about Sean Connery. The gorgeous and talented Eva Green is a total bonus. Very well done. Hopefully the next one will be as good!",negative
"how bond should be. daniel craig is the best bond ever. great cast, cracking locations, dynamite action and no CGI in sight, can i get an amen! this is how movies should make you feel!",positive
I LOVE this movie!!!,positive
Bloody fantastic Bond...,positive
Really good but not sure I like Craig as Bond,positive
"One of the best Bond films ever. Daniel Craig is brilliant at the more humanized bond in this series and demonstrated a subtle ""coolness"" which I adored. Seeing the Aston flip was also great.",positive
"My favorite James Bond film. Daniel Craig is a bad ass and this movie is packed with action, while having a typical 007 story that never gets boring.",positive
"The old James Bonds were all about sexing women. This James bond looks at you, and you know he will kick your ass before you know what's happened.",positive
Daniel Craig totally ownz Brosnan ...,positive

was alright but not as good as the past Bond movies,negative
Normally hate Bond movies but this one was not bad.,negative
AWSOME MOVIE HES THE BEST BONF EVER,positive
"Den bedste bond-film jeg har set. Super fedt at man finder ud af hvorfor 007 er som han nu engang er i de andre film. Daniel Craig gÃ¸r det ganske udemÃ¦rket som Bond, og Mads Mikkelsen er ganske okay som skurk, hans irriterer mig dog stadig. Kan klart anbefales, selv til dem der ikke gÃ¥r op i James Bond!",positive
"Ok, I was so tired I fell asleep a couple times, not on purpose though. I thought it interesting how effects of deception was portrayed, and yet Bond still tries to rescue Vesper.",negative
THIS is Bond. It's a shame it wasn't always like this. All we need now is for the old films to be remade with Daniel Craig.,positive
Can't believe it took me this long to see it! OMG... Mr DC !!! Great film!,positive
Loved it! One of my favorite Bond Movies,positive
"Terrific movie. I think it's my favorite Bond film. Daniel Craig doesn't quite fit the bill physical wise, but his attitude was perfect.",positive
I DON'T THINK DANIEL CRAIG HAS ENOUGH OF BOND MATERIAL,negative

The first James Bond Movie I have ever sat through. It was great.,positive
"Daniel Craig is the best James Bond by far! Bond is mean just like he should be, none of that cheesy crap.",positive
"Hey, this was pretty alright. The action sequences were so fake but it was an enjoyable watch never the less. Daniel Craig does really well as a convincing Bond; no comment about the torture scene.",negative
"Excellent movie, probably one of the best JB movie. He doesn't seem as desperate for some ass like the other movies that JB was portrayed.",positive
"Not a huge Bond fan, but this movie was awesome. Great action fight scenes. Daniel Craig was an excellent fit in this ""re-branding"" of Bond.",positive
"La premiere Ã  dire que Daniel Craig n'avait pas l'etoffe d'un Bond, la premiere Ã  me l etre fermÃ© apres avoir vu le film. Dans mon top 3 de la saga",positive
This blond Bond is face ugly.,negative
"Brains, great action, and a Bond that's both more human and more badass.",positive
"This just in: Daniel Craig is cool! I approve. Solid movie, nothing amazing, but fun and easy to watch. Also note - my first Blu-Ray experience, so that gives it extra brownie points or whatever.",negative
Decent Bond flick. Great action sequences and the story is a good one. While the tech. and the post 9/11 setting make for a confusing Bond timeline (since this is supposed to be an early mission after gaining 00 status) the contempoary story telling and character development was a bonus to the already impressive span the Bond series has. The worst blemish would be the lack of charisma Daniel Craig has for the role. He really doesn't feel like Bond material to me.,negative
I thought Sean Connery was the sexiest Bond alive until Danny Boy.,positive
"A little faithfull to the novel... At last, a true bond movie without gadgets. There is som differences between the movie and the novel.",positive
"Movie is OK, but totally worthwhile due to Daniel Craig's overwhelming hotness.",positive
"I've watched this movie over and over and the only flaw that comes to mind is that this is not a Bond film in the traditional sense, but I have no problem with that at all! This is a 'good movie' I think, a balanced love story, action tale, espionage thriller with strong characters who act rationally, and some you can even care for and admire. Pierce Brosnan could not make this work. This is Bond in name only, but the story moves, the characters change, and the action is amazing.",positive
love me some Daniel Craig,positive
Wow! This movie is awesome. It looks like Sir Sean Connery has some competition.,positive
"Okay,I was shocked at how good it was. I grew up with Brosnan as the default Bond, and though he was eminently capable, he was a public school douchebag, who you consistently, starting from Goldeneye on, felt more wise to root against. Craig, you fear, but you support him. The comedy is all male aggression this time, this is gritty and dominant Quake to Brosnan's Unreal nerf engine. The pacing of the movie is so spectacular, until you get to the strange, arduous last 20 minutes where Bond jumps the shark. I can hardly blame Ian fleming for front-loading all of the action, surely Mads Mikkelsen deserved a better death.",negative
Daniel Craig IS James Bond!! Superb start to the reimaging of the franchise. Can't wait to see the next :),positive
Can't wait for more CraigBond,positive
I think Daniel Craig could kick all the other Bond's asses.,positive
has to be my favourite bond film so far. But why oh why did they trash the aston and not the mundano?,positive
"An interesting reboot to the series. I'm slightly miffed that they screwed with his cocktail, but I'm a little OCD, so......",positive
not to bad a bit slow thou,negative
I was totally against rebooting and wated Clive owen to play Bond. After seeing this i couldn't be more wrong.,positive
"My favourte Bond film,Daniel Craig is immense. And it has a great story and sets up so much for the future.",positive
"didn't think i was going to like it, since i was opposed to a blonde bond. and i initially didn't. but after watching it again, it really is a great ""bond begins"" movie.",positive
"It was pretty entertaining, though not very realistic. I loved the animated opening credits.",negative
"I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as other James Bond movies. I was a lot darker, and this James Bond is much less likable.",negative
my favorite james bond movie,positive
"I just don't like these kinds of films. Not that they are in any way awful, but to me, they're boring as heck.",negative
best james bond yet for me.,negative
Breath taking. non stop action. Holds to the bond legend. this movie does not drag. thumbs up.,positive
"I like James Bond movies,. Daniel Craig is a good Bond,. Can't wait for the nest Bond . Daniel stars in it to. He's sexy",positive
I think Craig did it justice.,negative
Any doubts I had with Daniel Craig taking the reins as the new James Bond were instantly thrown into the wind after seeing this film. This was the breath of life into the Bond series for a new generation of 007 fans. Casino Royale is action-packed and supported by great acting and a superior storyline...,positive
I LOVE BOND! I always liked Sean Connery the best until this movie...Daniel Craig is awesome!,positive
Excellent James Bond movie,positive
One of the top three Bond movies ever.,positive
See it for the foot chase.,positive
"not a huge fan of daniel craig but he fills the shoes of sean connery and pierce brosnan pretty well. no i didnt forget roger moore, he just sucked too.",positive
"The second viewing was better than the first, when I felt bombarded by action that I wasn't taking it all in. This film has one of, if not the best action sequence with the parkour chase. Amazing. Love Daniel Craig's Bond: he's fallible, yet skilled. A sexy beast.",positive
Best Bond movie I've ever seen.,positive
"Might actually be my favorite Bond film- completely love Craig as Bond. A very sexy, action-packed film.",positive
"One of the best Bond movies for a long time. For the first time in years James seems like more character than caricature. I felt this movie had some real drama to it and not just action. The twists and betrayals were predictable, but that's perhaps better than implausible. Sadly, we had although we have the masterful Judy we miss out on Geoffrey. Shame about the repeated and entirely unsubtle product placement.",negative
"Best Bond film ever. Tough gutsy fully developed and mature approach. Bond is written with real depth and the relationship with Vesper is complex and life changing. Daniel Craig is a reborn Bond, plays it as if he's originating it and is a bold choice. Eva Green also matches him with a thorough characterization and is much more interesting than in the book. Rare movie to improve on the book. Kudos to the producers for doing so much right in this one. Director Martin Campbell's masterpiece. Even the song and David Arnold's score are well placed. Keep it up!",positive
"better than the previous bond films, but that isnt saying much",negative
A real bond would never fall for such traps. Where's the cool guy who outsmarted and outwitted all the bad guys? What an awful bond movie.,negative
"If Daniel Craig had a more shapely ass, I'd prolly have cried:D",positive
The best 007 movie yet!,positive
"I have to give this James Bond movie 5 stars for several reasons: 1)It is one of the best Bond movies as far as plot, 2) Daniel Craig is one of the best Bonds since Sean Connery, 3) The action, humor, and storytelling is top notch.",positive
Super bon james Bond; une claque pour la gÃ©nÃ©ration Pierce brossman! inovation dans le genre et le personage sans pour autant boulverser le myth!,negative
"DC's refreshing interpretation of the character, along with a fantastic script (taking the thrilling-but-thin novel and increasing its scope) and the return of Martin Campbell (the best recent-era Bond director) make this an absolute corker. It's not just one of the best BOND films ever made, it's a straight-up classic FILM in its own right. Vesper overtakes OHMSS's Tracy to claim the prize as the best 'girl' of the series. She's a properly complex, nuanced character, and Eva Green does a spectacular job of bringing her to life. She has become one of my favourite actresses, largely due to her performance here. Jeffrey Wright manages to make Felix likeable in the little room he has to move. It's certainly the most interesting interpretation out of the many we've had. Mads Mikkelsen brings tons of charisma and menace, a punchable smugness, and even a bit of vulnerability to Le Chiffre. We despise him and fear him, but we also understand his frustration, and even fear FOR him (a bit) when Mr White (Jesper Christensen: great) shows up. The action scenes are all topnotch, the cinematography is stunning, as are the costumes (Vesper's purple dress...). Chris Cornell's theme song is brilliant, and meets my criteria for a good theme - it's of its time, not a yawnworthy '60s throwback; it sounds unmistakably like a Bond theme; but it also sounds unmistakably like a song by the artist producing it. Punchy rock befitting an action thriller. Love it. Being the Bond fan that I am, I watch the movies quite a bit, particularly the ones I like most. Some of them start to show cracks after repeated viewings, but so far this one holds up very well. I gave it five stars after first seeing it, and have never had reason to consider revising that score.",positive
My balls still hurt from seeing that. Holy crap. <_<,negative
Daniel Craig is smokin' hot! Bond is interesting again. Great story!,positive
"Well, I reckon Daniel Craig is the best James Bond So far. Eva Green's character is what every woman should be, classy, smart, beautiful, and yet gentle.",negative
"This was the best Bond movie ever, in my opinion. It wasn't like your usual Bond flick at all, since it was the 'first' of the series. Frankly I think it should have been done long ago. I've seen all of them, and this was the only one that never made me roll my eyes or feel like I was watching a clichÃ©. It brought so much depth into the character of James Bond, I actually felt for him. Which has never happened before.",positive
"Really good, great action. I'm not a great judge though, since I haven't seen any of the original Bond movies since I was a kid.",positive
Daniel Craig was really good,negative
"Bond is an ice man in this, a great bond",positive
Craig is superb as Bond!,positive
"Fantastico...il vero James Bond dei libri di Ian Fleming! Non vedo l'ora che esca il prossimo 007 ""Quantum of Solace"" il 7 Novembre 2008",positive
"Let me go on record as saying that I hate the James Bond franchise. It is pretentious and devoid of character development. Actually, most the entertainment comes from the bad guys. However, CR takes Bond in an entirely different direction. This Bond is new, conflicted and not all knowing, unlike his predecessors. Great film. I look forward to more from this generation of Bond, and in particular, Daniel Craig.",positive
"this movie was awesome. james bond lives the life of guns, cars, and women and nobody lives it better than him. the best bond movie in the series. daniel craig is a perfect choice as the new bond.",positive
Er godt tilfreds med Daniel Craig i rollen som Bond.,positive
"I would never expect to like a James Bond movie but I liked this one. Very, very good! Finally, a very human 007!",positive
"It felt like a James Bond movie gone in a different direction which in retrospect has been long over due. In being a huge James Bond fan, Pierce Brosnan had become my favorite Bond. I'm still warming up to Daniel Craig but he did a great job. Gone are many of the corny Bond comments and cookie cutter plot. Casino Royale was a breath of fresh air to the series.",positive
This is the best Bond film of them all! Daniel Craig is probably the best James Bond since Sean Connery.,positive
The Best James Bond movie EVER. I love Daniel Craig as Bond - very compelling...,positive
Not a big Bond fan but I loved this movie. Daniel Craig owns the role in my opinion.,positive
Daniel Craig is an amazing bond he is almost as good as Sean Connery..almost!!,positive
I like this film more each time I watch it. The best Bond film they have made in 20+ years! Craig makes a fantastic bond and the story and action are terrific.,positive
who doesn't want 2 c it,positive
Good stuff. I liked how they changed up the typical Bond formula. But there were still explosions and stuff.,positive
"class, really gritty",positive
"Y'a pas Ã  dire, Daniel Craig, il assure. MÃªme aprÃ¨s l'avoir vu et revu, j'aime toujours autant ce James Bond, qui renouvelle totalement le genre (et il Ã©tait temps !). Eva Green nous montre enfin une James Bond Girl qui sort des clichÃ©s habituels. Bref, il sera difficile de l'Ã©galer, chose que n'a d'ailleurs pas rÃ©ussi Ã  faire Quantum of Solace malheureusement. EspÃ©rons donc que le(s) prochain(s) sera(ont) Ã  la hauteur de celui ci.",positive
Favourite Bond film to date. Love Eva also.,positive
love the poker and the intro song mainly,positive
Not bad for a Bond movie.,negative
Don't know why it took me so long to watch this one. Action-packed thrill ride and one hot Bond! Two thumbs way up!,positive
"This is a GREAT reboot to the Bond series, breathing new life into the series. The film has so much great style about it, great acting and a storyline that really is witty and grand! Eva Green and Daniel Craig really are amazing in this film. Great Bond film!",positive
"New James...not as handsome as the one before, not as clever as the one before...but the car is new & better... New is good~Right?",negative
"By far, my favorite Bond movie. The ""birth"" of Bond is compelling, there's still twists and cliffs, and decent stunts. And yes, I'm a total sucker for the whole fated love element. I'm a girl afterall.",positive
"I've been thinking a lot about this movie lately, and I'm not sure why. I do think it's just about perfect as an action film and as a Bond film, regardless of detractors saying it's not a ""real"" Bond movie. Why, because it breaks just about every formula that the series has fallen into over the past few decades? It's odd to me that they'd suggest that sticking to a rigid formula and not giving the audience any surprises is a good thing. Not that the previous Bond films are bad (I've been a fan since my childhood), but after the series degenerated into self-parody with Die Another Day (on a side note, I'd like to give my sympathies to Pierce Brosnan, who was one of my favorite Bonds stuck in some of the worst movies of the series, save Goldeneye), I'd like to see the person who didn't think it was time for a change. Hell, half the fun of Casino Royale was not being able to anticipate where the plot went next. I was watching a Bond movie, and had no idea where the movie was going, and it was unbelievably refreshing. Even the false ending, which was a point of contention for some, delighted me because it was a clear sign of the filmmakers trying to give audiences a whole new Bond experience. Of course, most of the bile from detractors was aimed square at Daniel Craig, for what might be the most incredibly petty reasons ever. Oh no, he's BLONDE?!?!?! Call MGM, axe this fuckin' thing! Christ, he's not even that blonde to begin with. Not to mention he gives a fantastic performance, so any bickering about his appearance is rendered moot anyway, if those arguments held water to begin with (which they didn't). And on the acting note, even the Bond girl is terrific, here played by the lovely Eva Green. Like Roger Ebert pointed out in his belated review, this is one of the only Bond films in which we're actually allowed to care about the characters, which is in no small part due to the superb acting. The shower scene between Green and Craig is perhaps the most touching in the entire series, partly because it shows one of the few times in which Bond actually seems like a living, breathing human being with actual emotions. Of course, this scene (and the ending) are meant to highlight why Bond eventually loses his humanity, but it's still a high point of the series. Whatever. I've written too many words on a Bond movie already. For those four or five people who haven't seen it yet, Casino Royale is the best Bond movie in decades, in addition to being just one of the best films of 2006, and haters can bite my ass.",positive
I don't totally care for this one,negative
"TrÃ¨s trÃ¨s bon bond en avant avec ce Bond!!!(je sais elle Ã©tait facile). DÃ©ja je trouve que le choix de prendre Daniel Craig Ã©tait audacieux et c'est payant car en un film il s'impose dÃ©jÃ  comme l'un des meilleurs James Bond, tout en force, en charisme (il fallait au moins Ã§a pour dÃ©poussiÃ©rer la franchise",positive
i love james.. he cools in all the action movies..,negative
A great start to the new James Bond series,positive
"Thing is, a blonde Bond just doesn't work for me....",negative
"Horrifyingly awful, daniel craig sucks and there was almost nothing remotely good about it except... oh wait i cant think of anything. There is only one bond worse than this and that is Quantum of Solace. SO AWFUL, took bond and smashed it in the face.",negative
"Okay, a lot of action. Kind of bored me. But looking at Daniel was a highlight!",negative
best bond since goldeneye.,positive
"I was excited to see this because I've had friends trying to hype me up on Bond my whole life. Sure, for action movies they're pretty great, but action movies aren't really my thing most of the time. I like this film for all of the poker scenes and for the way they made the movie more gritty and realistic than any other Bond movie I've seen. No crazy over-the-top gadgets or stunts here... you get a parcore chase and lots of fights with guns and machetes and that's about it. Daniel Craig is merely ""meh"" as Bond. I started to warm to him a little by the end but I think Pierce did a better job.",negative
This movie is the James Bond I have been waiting for. Wonderful Action Packed,positive
"I prefer Pierce as Bond, I actually fell asleep during this one.",negative
Oooo I loved it. New Bond for this new world.,positive
"As an action movie, it's good, but not extraordinary- say 3 stars. But the major and critical flaw of this movie is Daniel Craig!!! He's as good in the James Bond role as Woody Allen in Terminator, or rather said, as Mr T would be if impersonating Lizzie McGuire! If Dear 007 was KGB, I'd give that movie 5 thumbs up :) But, as it happens, the distinguished gentleman created by Ian Flemming as an MI6 agent only has two faces: Sean Connery (who, despite his age, should make a better Bond NOWADAYS as Daniel Craig ever would or could!!!) and Pierce Brosnan, who was a bit better than Roger Moore, as he had a really British style. I'm afraid we'll have to wait for 4 or 5 more of 'James Bond was Russian' movies, before at least a suitable actor comes up (what about Clive Owen? Cillian Murphy? and so many others, good or bad, that just can't be worse than good actor Mr Craig, whose movies I usually like, but has no verisimilitude as 007!",negative
It's a good movie...,positive
Interesting to see Bond vulnerable and subsequently how he has become to be the way he is later in life.,negative
"I was always a big fan of James Bond, but this movie really dissapoint me! There was no Shakin-not-stirred drink, no unlimited romance (he ALWAYS stays with the woman, when she offers sex) and the song theme is rearly played in the movie - but still the action was there! I HATED THE MOVIE!!!",negative
One of my favourite Bond movies!!,positive
I don't know if it's *the* best Bond movie - but it's damn close.,positive
Love it soooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"La poursuite au dÃ©but du flim est peu crÃ©dible mais on a vu pire (""Meurs un autre jour""... ridicule). Autrement un bon James Bond.",negative
best bond flick ive ever had the good fortune of seeing...and randy has the entire collection. makes me wanna watch 'em all over again,positive
"Daniel Craig does a great job as Bond, and the whole feel of the film does a great balancing act of staying true to the aspects of the franchise that we love while updating it to keep it current. On top of that, James Bond doesn't have any bullshit flying cars or laserbeam eyes or fucking invisible rocket boots.",positive
"(Review revisited) Very good Bond movie. I had some doubts about shark-eyed Craig, but they were just groundless. Unlike any from Brosnan series, I'm curious about the new one (Quantum of Solace).",positive
is great!!!!! watched it this wknd.,positive
"A better Bond film than any over the last decade, however it has all been done before.",negative
DANIEL CRAIG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"Yay, not-sucky Bond movie.",negative
"First of all, it helps when I have a major crush on the Bond girl, which in the case of Eva Green, I do. So check. Also, Daniel Craig was awesome. They needed to bring in a guy who could bring the character into the present and they found him. Not the greatest story in the world (Seriously, could you not figure out she was playing him from the get go???) but entertaining nonetheless.",negative
The best Bond movie I've seen in many years.,negative
"James Bond has never satisfied my likin'. I suppose you either love him or hate him. I got tricked into watchin' this, people sayin' oh it's not like the others, it's a great stand alone movie, i trusted & believed & these people really did waste my time.",negative
better than expected,positive
I've never seen 007 as such a bad ass...awesome!!,positive
"Shame on you, James Bond writers.",negative
"A film about playing cards. You could watch late night poker on TV and be as entertained. Bring back James Bond films with Bond girls who have innuendos for names (e.g. Dr Goodhead), Nazi collonies on the moon, and meglomaniac villains.",negative
"Daniel Craig is the best bond since Sean Connery, and the film itself is the best since From Russia With Love.",positive
"I really like the way they curbed this Bond movie, although I've never really been that hyped about Bond. Daniel Craig is awesome! I like Mads Mikkelsen too, but best when he's not saying anything in english though :P",positive
"I have to admit that I wasn't looking forward to a new Bond, but Daniel Craig did a great job in this movie. He portrayed a darker, more serious 007 with a more definitive edge to his character. As always, a movie that had great action throughout. This is a movie worth owning!",positive
Finally - Bond is back,positive
The new Bond is hot hot hot :),positive
"I wanted to like it more, but I just didn't like Daniel Craig as James Bond. However, I did like the more cerebral story, the history of Bond, and the black and white sequence. However, no Q, no Money Penny (which, I guess is all right since they needed the mislead), and very few Bond-esque quips.",negative
"It wasn't the best bond movie, but Daniel Craig did a good job being Bond, and I liked the story in the movie a lot.",positive
"I Think one of the best Bond films made,hope the rest breath new life into the Bond Movie which it needed.",positive
Best bond yet. Makes bond out to be more human.,positive
"Awesome! Best in the series, IMHO. Eva Greene is hotness. Understated, underplayed, tense and not a wasted moment.",negative
"loved it! i was skeptical about the new actor, but i think he really brought out the James Bond character. great one liners, i love sarcasm so this was great for me. and full of action and bits of hysteria, so i just loved it!",positive
"excellent James Bond, j'avais portant trÃ¨s peur , trÃ¨s hÃ©ros classique ( trÃ¨s mÃ¢le, fait comme un dieu grec, courageux, brillant, protecteur, fragile.ouf!) les dÃ©buts de Ã¨ Bond ou comment il gagne son double 00 Craig est trÃ¨s convaincant malgrÃ© un physique , disons pas trÃ¨s avantageux, par rapport Ã  cette beautÃ© de Pierce. Un gros challenge !",positive
New beginning for the James Bond movies.,positive
Probably the best Bond movie i have seen yet,positive
BEST BOND EVER!! I have seen all the bonds flicks since I've been growing up and what Daniel Craig brings to the 007 universe is just amazing...,positive
"One of the very very best Bond movies of all time. Arguably best James Bond since Connery. Good story and a great movie, well worthy of the Bond name.",positive
"An excellent updating of James Bond's first adventure as agent 007. Eva Green is, by far, the most intelligent and elegant of the James Bond femme fatales.",positive
"I love the old James Bond flicks. The newer ones I have grown to like, accepting them more as good action flicks than James Bond. (Sean Connery and Roger Moore will ALWAYS be James Bond in my book) That being said, this movie fell short on all levels. Two hours that I would never get back.",negative
Un nouveau James Bond prend les responsabilitÃ©s de sa promotion en tant qu'agent 007. Sa premiÃ¨re mission? DÃ©jouer les plans machiavÃ©liques d'une bande de terroristes internationaux. Attention au bluff...,positive
This is what James Bond is supposed to be. He is an assassin. Not a spy. This isn't your father's 007.,positive
Daniel Craig is just a beautiful human specimen!,positive
"After the disappointment of Die Another Day, this pushed Bond films back to where they belong. Proper stunts and some gritty drama. I look forward to the next installment.",positive
"Not a James Bond fan, but I still liked it.",negative
"Bond, James Bond......",positive
"wow, 4 stars on flixster. daniel craig is just ... i can only remember judi dench. i hope there's no more daniel craig as 007.",negative
"I had heard this new Bond was supposed to be more ""real"" - and yes, I appreciate the more cynical tone. However, the movie as a whole is so incoherent! The Madagascar sequence is just awkward, almost Jackie Chan! But the 2nd half, with the casino and torture scenes, is so much better and more ""real"" (within a Bond frame of reference... :P)",negative
"BOND IS BACK!!!! THIS is hov it supposed to be, Daniel Craig delivers a brilliant performance in this one. He IS Bond, no doubt. He is a worthy opponent to the almighty Sean Connery and Roger Moore. I cannot wait until the next one is out. There is hovever 2 thing i like to point out that is missing in this movie. First off, the soundtrack, it is great but the title is not the title of movie, bommer!!!! Second, the intro. There is no female siluettes dancing and doing stuff like in all other Bond movies.",positive
"I love how you can really see Bond learning to become ""Bond"". At the start he even stacks it a few times in the chase. It adds a touch of realism.",positive
Where are the gadgets?,negative
"good story, not really enough action, but the little that there was was good",negative
"Best Bond film! Daniel Craig was great. No ridiculous gadgets, down to earth and Bond was oh-so-human!",positive
"Saw this when it first came out in the theaters and saw it again today on cable. It's still as good as it ever was -- James Bond back to the basics; all run and jump action with less emphasis on the high end toys and special effects, this is a James Bond you can believe. As good as the original Sean Connery if not better. Up there with Jason Bourne. Showtime On Demand.",positive
"Overall, a good new beginning for Bond. More realistic and gritty, but Mads Mikkelsen is utterly boring as big bad villain Le Chiffre. The end sequence is a bit longish as well, but not enough to not make it worth your while.",negative
it was so cool!. one of my favourite bond movies for sure. sean conery is till the better bond though.,negative
One of the best of the bond films,negative
he's better den pierce brosnan!!,negative
modern bond..i like it,positive
Quite good actually!,positive
"The best and grittiest of the Bonds, harking back to From Russia with Love, and On Her Majesty's..., and Licence to Kill. The film is very moving, and the most thrilling of the 21.",positive
Best Bond since Goldeneye.,negative
i am a HUGE 007 fan and this is the best of the series... ever...,positive
"Incredible! I'm not a big fan of Bond, but WOW, this movie really blew me away. Daniel Craig makes a brilliant Bond and I must say, he is by far the hottest Bond, too! Eva Green is a fantastic Bond girl. Simply awesome.",positive
Watched it last night on Sky Movies. Excellent reworking of the franchise.,positive
Fairly Good. I'm still not sure if I like the idea of a Blond James Bond. I'll wait to make my decision based on the next one.,positive
"This was an overall good film. It causes some chronology issues with past films, mostly with ""M"" Dame Judy Dench, but it was still fun to watch.",positive
"Very different from the original Bond movies. I prefer the others (this is my least favorite). I mean, c'mon...he had blond hair! What's that about?!",negative
Excelente pelicula de James Bond. Diferente. Craig se luce. La direccion es muy buena. La recomiendo,positive
Best James Bond Movie So Far,positive
"One of the best Bond films because it's so different and refreshing. The combat rarely seems uninteresting, as there's always something at risk. It steps away from the same tired formula and it's better for it.",positive
"As a Bond fan, i have to say that having seen Casino Royale, Daniel Craig's performance is so good, it puts him on a par with my favourite Bond of all time Sean Connery, everything about Casino Royale is great, from the casting,locations, to the production and direction, the story goes back to basics to coin an often used phrase as we see Craigs Bond begin his career with his first mission, whereas other Bonds come through fights and action scenes without hardly a hair out of place, Craigs Bond is shown with cuts all over, and shows him to be human, the script is first class, and I would say like Batman Begins, Bond creators have gone back to the drawing board, and have also come up with an excellent storyline, and film, which will suerly ranks with the classic Bonds, as i said Craig has proved himself to be a great Bond, despite early hesitations, but having seen him in other films, I knew he had it in him to be a Great Bond, and I'v been proved right, a good supporting cast including Eva Green,Judi Dench as M, Danish actor Mads Miklesen as the villian is also outstanding, Director Martin Campbell who has previous Bond experience once again delivers the goods.",positive
"For a change of pace and character, the new serious Bond approach is good. Sean and Pierce are better but damn this was a good movie.",positive
"Daniel Craig is hot, and so is the action in this movie. I am not a Bond fan, but can't wait to see the next one!",positive
best bond movie ever,positive
Best Bond film ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"Chouette renouvÃ¨lement de la sÃ©rie, Daniel Craig est convaincant et Eva Green a tomber",negative
La fin en queue de poisson...mais le reste est excellent!,positive
Great action and plot. Craig makes such a good bond.... james bond.,positive
"haha...""now everyone will know you died scratching my balls!!"" love it",positive
waaaaaaaaaaaay too long,negative
"A welcome addition to the Bond series with a new sense of realism instilled into it. The movie does an awesome job creating just the right atmosphere for the important scenes, and Craig does an effective job potraying the renown cold-blooded yet detachable agent. The amount of detail keeps the viewer on his toes constantly, all combined with the high-class action scenes no Bond film can run without...",positive
James Bond is great as usual. A different but refreshing take on the Bond role by Daniel Craig.,positive
Best Bond film in a while,positive
I'm not a fan of the J. Bond movies whom heroes where quite a stereotype (outside S. Connery but a bit too oldies now to my pov). Despite of some clichÃ©s (assumed) this movie was greatly entertaining.,positive
Un des meilleurs James Bond...!,positive
"140 minutes du Bond Nouvelle formule a la sauce Campbell. Avec son look de mechant, Craig n'a rien du gentleman. Ce nouveau Bond a ses fans. Tant mieux... mais c'Ã©tait mieux avant !",negative
Endelig en rigtig Ian Fleming James Bond,positive
So impressed. Daniel Craig is an amazing Bond.,positive
Bientot un James Bond gay ?,positive

not as good as the other james bonds. he wasnt sexy enough. lol.,negative
hell yeah he is the best bond yet.,positive
"I do have to give the latest Bond release the royale or should I say the royal treatment. It was popcorn entertainment at its apex. Daniel Craig plays all the right cards in ""Casino Royale"" as the new James Bond. This blonde Bond will bond with many Bond films aficionados which prefer a more rugged, menacing Bond. The film is based on the Ian Fleming novel that focuses on 007's early days. Jimmy boy's nemesis this time is Le Chiffre played by Mads Mikkelsen; Chiffre is a corrupt banker, who like most antagonists in Bond films or in all action films for that matter, do their malevolence stuff to collect a whole bunch of mula. Le Chiffre's obscure peculiarity is that he cries blood. Yes, he is Le Chief of the ""bloodshot eyes"" and contrary to popular belief not Mel Gibson. James and Le Chiffre duel it out in a cerebral casino card match and eventually in more hands-on type of matches. Eva Green plays Vesper Lend, a feminist accountant who lends her wisdom to James but initially not her body. Green is incandescent and has to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. ""Casino Royale"" stirs it up with plenty of classic Bond action sequences that are gripping and exhilarating. Director Martin Campbell's ""soup""er dexterity in constructing ""Casino Royale"" was commending. The only misfire in ""Casino Royale"" was its semi-droning screenplay. In summary, I hope you feel that my film review for ""Casino Royale"" was naught shaky and immensely stirring. **** Good",positive
Best James Bond for quite some time! I loved it.,positive
the only enjoyable part ios the chase... but the movie kept going and i kept snoring.,negative
Bond is back after an eternity of bad movies,positive
best bond flick yet..and bond..,positive
"sorry gaetano, but it was the worst 007 i've ever seen",negative
Best Bond since Connery and Moore,positive
Quite possibly the most exciting action movie in a very very long time.,positive
"Daniel Craig as the new Bond actor caused lots of commotion before the release, but he performed well. The movie itself contained some time anachronisms: while they casted this Bond as the newbie agent in the beginning of his carreer, M mentions she ""misses the Cold war"", etc.",positive
Only Bond movie I did not care for,negative
the best bond film so far!!!not only that but daniel craig looks alot like my fella.,positive
A FRESH..DIFFRENT KIND OF JAMES BOND,negative
Wow. Excellent Bond film. Craig sits just below Sean Connery as the best Bond ever.,positive
This is an action packed film,negative
"I was so floored by Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond that I saw this film twice in one week. The movie was so well done that even as a technologist (and therefore someone who appreciates gadgets), I was happy to see how viscerally Bond was played--it turns out that Bond doesn't _need_ a host of ridiculous gadgets to get the job done.",positive
"Wow. This one took me totally by surprise. I wasn't a very big fan of Bronson's Bond movies, but Daniel Craig really sells this. He's easily the best bond since Connery, and perhaps even better. The level of attention to detail in this movie is just amazing, and it achieves an atmosphere and sense of intelligence virtually unseen in the entire franchise. This is a very different Bond for a very different age, and I can't wait to see this franchise continue.",positive
"James Bond has to have dark hair, OK?",negative
i like danial greig most as james bond,positive
Me faciana el 007 a pelica tmbien!!!,positive
"When I went to see this movie for the first time I thought that Craig wouldn't be good at all, but he proved me wrong. This is probally the best Bond film since Live and Let Die. I look forward to this re-invented style Bond in the future. Quantum of Solace here we come.",positive
great movie i want to see another,negative
One of the best Bond films!,positive
"Craig is great as Bond. Eva Green is hot. There is tons of shooting, poker, car chases, and all other things manly. If you're a man and you don't like this movie, go put a new tampon in you pansy.",positive
The Best Movie of 06,positive
"Loved it, best Bond in a while",positive
Easily one of the best Bond movies made.,positive
"I like the gritty, hard nosed, & bloody Bond. They seemed to take a pageout of the Batman Begins playbook. This was like Bondman Begins, and it's begun very well!",positive
"When this one came out at the theater, I refused to go see it, I didn't think I would like Daniel Craig as Bond. However, I eventually rented it, and fell in love. Daniel Craig is perfect for the part.",positive
One of the best bond films. Daniel Craig is the best bond since Sean Connery.,positive
I love the new James Bond...,positive
Truly the best Bond movie I've seen since Golden Eye. A great start for new Bond Daniel Craig who gives a great performance. The story itself is cool with some weird turns throughout the plot but nothing too outrageous to turn you off to it. Aside from some odd moments in the movie there are great action sequences throughout. Definitley a solid Bond movie to say the least.,positive
"eh...not a very good bond flick. Less mindless then the last few have been, yet at the same time I really didn't feel like sitting watching them play cards for so long. Also the ""badguy"" was rather pitiful, and really had no evil scheme or anything (as the most often do in the classic bond movies). Having bond save the world from nuclear destruction, or from a rampaging space station is far more fun then having him win money...Daniel Craig makes a good bond, now he just needs a good bond story to be put in",negative
Awesome...dont like the old james bond movies tho,positive
[font=Tahoma]Hey:fresh: [/font] [font=Tahoma]James Bond Casino Royale was a very awsome movie!! (yes I know that wasnt proper english.) But anyways when I went to see this movie I thought that it wasnt going to be that good because of the new James Bond; man I was wrong!! This was a very excellent movie! I liked that it was a younger James Bond and that the action in it was very good and the near death experience had me at the edge of my seat in the theater!! I am very happy that they are coming out with a new James Bond movie and I cant wait to see that one either; I think that it will be better that Casino Royale!![/font] [font=Tahoma][/font] [font=Tahoma]-Caydubs2009:p [/font],positive
Love this film. Daniel Craig is brillant as the new Bond.,positive
"Daniel Craig had great pressure on his shoulders, and he lived up to it completely. From the fight scene at the beginning to the poison poker scene, well done to him.",positive
This movie was pretty good.,negative
The best James Bond by far.Daniel Craig pips Sean Connery as the best Bond.,positive
First twenty minutes are great...,negative
"CASINO ROYALE Casino Royale(Details here), is the latest in the highly successful Bond franchise. Boasting an all new Bond, Daniel Craig, and a new look at the character, it has generated itself a huge amount of interest. James Bond's first mission is portrayed in this film, where he must beat a rich accountant in a high stakes poker match at casino royale, as he is a massive financial backer of terrorism and knows useful information about many terrorists worldwide. The most noticeable element of this movie is the writing, it displays a great deal of skill, and gives us some more interesting elements of the Bond character. However the plot seems very disjointed towards the end, although the dialogue remains the centrepiece for the impressive writing. The action pieces in the film are very much over the top, which is a good thing to some extent, but towards the end of the initial chase scene, the action becomes a touch farcical, whilst a tongue in cheek sense of humour is welcomed, there is a limit of tolerance. In terms of acting, the supporting cast is quite admirable, however Daniel Craig fails to deliver a good performance, and is rather flat. His voice doesn't allow him to give the smoothness of speech that is necessary for the lines, and there are dramatic pauses where Craig fails to hold the screen as well as is needed. Direction of this film is notable, more than just the generic conventions, it displays good use of colour correction and kinetic camera work. There is no great attention to detail in each frame, but the atmosphere is generated in an appropriate way, as to overlook the lack of artistry. In terms of the 'Bond' franchise, Casino Royale is better written than most of them, and has better direction. The level of acting is better than most, however Craig's incarnation of Bond is inferior to at least two of his predecessors. As a whole movie, it does fair better than most of the others in the franchise. On the whole, Casino Royale is a welcome return for Bond, yet lacks the charisma of previous films. In terms on an action film, this movie certainly does well, although it never manages to become anything spectacular, just reasonably entertaining. Worth a watch, but don't hold your expectations too high.",negative
best bond since goldfinger,positive
another james bond and daniel craig has his own style that makes the viewers glued to watching Casino royale from beginning to end.,positive
I love it.. it was perfect!,positive
"Wow. This was a really good movie. I mean, my objectivity may have been tainted by the fact that it was the first movie I watched on Blu-ray, but I really thought this was great. It did exactly what it set out to do, and well. It was intelligent, classy, and thrilling. I can't believe how good this was.",positive
It Was Good. But I've Just Never Thought Of Bond As Really Ripped. Didn't Buy That Part.,negative
"Good movie, but I am still not a fan of the new bond they casted for the part.",negative
"This was definately a Bond film that, for the most part, I enjoyed. It really is the ""Batman Begins"" of the Bond series, as they reboot the series, without all the crazy gadgets, and showing Bond as what he is. A secret agent. I remember in the scene where M is berating him, she asks ""Where the bloody hell is he?"" or ""What is he doing?""; I was expecting him to be sleeping with some gorgeous woman he came across earlier, but to my utter shock and amazement, he was researching, doing actual agent work. Did I already mention that I liked that his gadgets were more realistic? Showing bond as a guy trying to learn to be suave with the ladies really gave depth to the character that I never knew existed, which is why Daniel Craig was ideal for the role. A few things bothered me. First, that occasionally, and ironically, despite that Craig is British, he'd say some things in a way that sounded distinctly like an American accent. Another major problem was that I didn't see much of a plot or it was lost on me all throughout the movie, and only after it being explained to me did I get whats going on. The card-game scenes didn't help in this, as they dragged, though THOSE scenes dragged in a way that was good and entertaining and kept me engaged. The third major problem I had with the movie was something that dragged that got EXTREMELY dull after a while, and that was the whole Bond/Lynd love sequence towards the end of the film. halfway through that sequence I was seriously like ""Ok, I get it, you're in love, you want to spend the rest of your life with her, and so on and so on... now get on with the plot already!"" That sequence shouldn't have been more than two or three scenes. Overall, those three problems aside, a worthy James Bond movie with its new, grittier, more realistic approach.",negative
"I can watch this Bond over and over again. I was very scepital of Craig at first, but he is defenitely a Bond. A great restart to a execellent series of films. I can't wait for the next to come out.",positive
i went in - expecting to be disappointed. and wasn't. not that that is saying all that much.,negative
"I like him as Bond, but the leading lady was not BOND girl material, she was gross... and he was weak.... eehhh",negative
"I give it a three for originality, but I don't like daniel craig",negative
Kudos ! This will become a classic !,positive
"Total action, total 007.",positive
"It's gritty, it's innovative, it's a great blend of action and dialogue. Daniel Craig silences doubters and shows he can handle a (British spelling>>)licence to kill. I won't say he's the best ever, as many others do with EVERY new bond, but he definitely brings a new style 007 to the silver screen. I ALSO won't be one of the many to say 'best Bond film ever', as many do with every single new film, but aside from being somewhat a reboot and a beginning, its very different. Summing up, any Bond fan should open up to a new beginning for 007.",negative
"I found this a good action / adventure / drama; I'm not a James Bond fan, so I don't have an opinion on whether or not Craig is a good Bond. I liked it!",positive
i just bought this movie for my mommy on mothers day,positive
"First Bond film I have ever seen :-) Excellent, but I have to admit - I did need a running commentary throughout :-) Excellent though, and would definitely watch it again",negative
"One of my favourite Bond films. Intelligent, keeps the tension and has a great cast. Not to forget it is beautifully filmed, which you can't always say about an action movie. Craig makes a fantastic Bond, taking the character from a slick ladies' man to a new, more serious level. Some action sequences suffer from lasting too long, but otherwise very well balanced. Also, the only Bond movie by far that has made me cry.",positive
"Great movie, very long though which is a bit of a drawback...I like the direction its taking...Bond back to his roots...working on his sophistication.",positive
"Enjoyable, but just barely.",negative
Gé-ni-al !!! Rien de plus à dire,positive
"Before this film, I had several James Bond films on my top 10 list, etc. This has taken over the #1 spot because of the way it shows us of how he came to be who he is...a jaded man because of the loves he has and the beating he takes (UGH!). Everything is there in this James Bond film, the girls, cars, gadgets, weapons, etc. I like it, and think I will go home and watch it.",positive
This was a true reinvention of Bond and it was sorely needed. A true return to form for the 007 franchise. Extremely refreshing in its storyline and new Bond actor.I hope Daniel Craig sticks around for a while. This one kicks ass.,positive
i love this movie!!!! the second best bond film ever dr.no being number 1,positive
That part where he almost died and all of a sudden she came and saved him was uber unbelievable they could've left that out,negative
The best Bond since Sean Connery,positive
Best James Bond film ever...can wait till next one...,positive
"Good 007 movie, but it needed more gadgets!",negative
Daniel Craig is the SHIT!!!!,positive
Whats up w/ the bond movies sucking lately?,negative
Not really Fond Of James Bond,negative
The best Bond Movie so far! Daniel Craig makes all of the other Bonds look like little girls. His rugged yet charming physique is perfect for the 007 character.,positive
"Perfection. Best Bond movie ever. Great plot, great acting, great locations, great action scenes, great women. Daniel Craig is perfect as Bond.",positive
"I agree that this is a big departure from what we've come to know as classic Bond, but do you really think that this isn't a good time to start over? I really liked Brosnan as Bond but the films were getting too silly and Die Another Day was way too stupid in too many places. With todays action fan wanting a hero you can really believe in it seems Daniel Craig was a very good choice for the new rough early Bond, and what better was to reinvent Bond than going back to the very beginning of his story. Casino Royale might not be Bond as we know it, but it is a great action film and does well in re-starting the series. Here's hoping that from this point on we get to see Bond from the very beginning to more of the Bond we know and love in the films to follow.",positive
Favorite Bond film by far. Get Bond back to who he is - a heartless coldblooded bastard,positive
10 out of 10 for those speedios!!!!,positive
"Juste le meilleur James bond ! vivement la suite, ""quantum of Solace"" !",positive
"Very well done, and Daniel Craig isn't too shabby on the eyes. :)",positive
"And just like that, the blight that was Pierce Brosnan (bar GoldenEye) is gone!",positive
Tot op heden de beste en meest verfrissende Bond,positive
"Good Relaunch for the Bond franchise, which was starting to suck big time.",negative
This was a true reinvention of Bond and it was sorely needed. I hope Daniel Craig sticks around for a while. This one kicked my ass.,positive
"Parkour stunts, the girl and the Austin were nice. Didn't like the new James too much though.",positive
Best bond flick since Goldeneye.,positive
"Wow, long live the new James Bond. Great action sequences, and it was cool seeing James at the beginning, before the suave seen it all done it all polish was applied.",positive
"Not the best looking Bond, but yet the best story-line/action/pace so far. I vote Judd Law to be the next Bond.",positive
Best bond. Go Craig!,positive
Bond stripped and brought back to his routes harder and badder then ever.,positive
"Have to admit i enjoyed it after belatingly watching, much more elemental and tight Bond flick, eliminating the kitsch and gimmicks Bonds has accumilated over the years. Only criticisms would stand from my Craig indifference and petty things but good stuff.",positive
much different than all the other james bond...definitely not the same as the original... doesn't seem like he fits the original James Bond personality. Good action though I guess.,negative
"Daniel Craig makes all Bond's before him look like they're running in slow motion. I was like a lot of people, upset with the choice not to renew Pierce Brosnan's contract and then stunned with the selection... I learned that I don't know jack about casting after seeing Casino Royale because the Bond producers WERE DEAD ON RIGHT to make the change. BRAVO!!! And I can't wait for the next one!",positive
No matter how many times I watch this it never fails to be completely made of awesome.,positive
This is the first Bond film that I've wanted to see in quite a long time. Well worth the wait and hope this Bond sticks around for awhile.,negative
"Very good, I like the Bond franchise. This one is one of the best, Craig outdid himself here. Great plot, villians weren't outragous and the gadgetry wasn't out of line. Hopefully this trend will continue.",negative
A refreshing revamp of this often tired franchise. Possibly the best Bond in decades...,positive
Not normaly a big james bond fan but this film realy kept me waiting for the end with a good story line amazing effects this film will guarntee you will be sitting on the edge of your seat,negative
"Better than Brosnan's one's, stunning cinematography",negative
"Maybe I'd like it more, but I hate James Bond, end of story.",negative
"An impecable re-imagining of James Bond, it's gritty, dirty, brutal and Daniel Craig pulls it all off flawlessly.",positive
Ok...but I loved the original.,negative
Not bad in his first outing as 007,positive
Greatest Bond film eva!! a lot betta than i thort it was gunna be:D,positive
Daniel Craig sucked big time...,negative
the best bond movie in my opinion..,positive
Awesome! Love it! Daniel Craig Phwoar! Have seen it hundreds of times now! Can't wait for Quantom of Solace!,positive
"Great, but Eva Green is ugly.",positive
"Like many, I had my doubts of Daniel Craig as Bond, but he did an incredible job. I like the bad*ss version that he richly pulls off.",negative
well...looks like monsieur bond got caught in the game himself. guess he's human after all. learnt a valuable lesson tho innit,negative
Didn't think he'd be a good Bond - but he plays it tough and it works - more realistic and less tongue in cheek ...,positive
"Cool plot, wellwritten, good actors, fab stunts and nice body, Daniel !!!",positive
"buena pela,no descepciona para nada a la saga de james bond",negative
"Bond is reinvented in this magnificent movie. Gone is the corny one-liners, Q branch and the gadgets. Daniel Craig is superb as 007. Many great action sequences.",positive
very nice action movie,positive
one of the very best James Bonds,positive
"A different kind of a Bond movie. A very good Bond movie, one of the best. It had all the necessary elements: the car,the witty remarks, the women, the gadgets... And some of these elements were turned into very clever parody. I was very impressed by this movie. The romance sequence, however, could've been shortened quite a bit; now it took some of the edge off the film and gave it too much length.",positive
I never liked James Bond's movie until I saw this one. Love Daniel Craig and his character. Great actions and pretty women. This Bond is just my man!,negative
"Enjoyed this movie much more than I thought I would, as I wasn't much of a fan of the James Bond franchise. However, the risk undertaking in ""reinventing"" the film series paid off in a big way. Craig is a complex Bond - the days of the wise-cracking, pompous Bond are numbered. Eva Green is beautiful and chews up every scene she's involved in. Comes recommended.",negative
"By far my favorite Bond film. Craig is really how I've pictured Bond all along. The story is amazing- I like how they've breathed new life into a franchise dieing from absurdity. It's the one up. It gets a lot of franchises. Each movie has to ""one up"" the last with gadgets, silly villains, or space station lairs. Just give me some good old hand-to-hand and a witty brute of an anti-hero (which is what Bond was in the beginning before we turned him into a smarmy pansy). Low on the tec, and high on the action.",positive
gay actor gay movie with 1 scene of action homosexual sequal has the same gay crak head in it trequal has the same gay crak head in it gay,negative
Best Bond flick so far,positive
Daniel Craig kicks ass,positive
Excellent action movie - although a lot of posing and disjoint in places. Quite cheesy too! A guilty pleasure though all the same.,positive
Good piece of work. Love the scenes where they are running and jumping and making all this freaking stuff on the high :),positive
great film best bond since sean connery,positive
"Great action flick, almost felt like 3 movies in one. Still not as good as Goldeneye, but i dont know if any Bond movie will be that good.",positive
the best bond movie.,positive
"The best Bond film in years! While it was a little hard to follow, it's filled with excitement, good stunts, and plenty of twists.",negative
"The best Bond movie since GoldenEye. Daniel Craig plays 007 with a new intensity, though Sean Connery still takes the cake as the Ultimate Bond.",positive
there was no roulette like in the previews. i was disappointed.,negative
"How can anyone not like/enjoy Casino Royale! With Daniel Craig being the Best Bond since Sean Connery, and an amazing cast, it was bound to have became the greatest 007 film of all time. I am very proud of everyone who worked on Casino Royale and made it the succsess it was, and am so glad it got the place in history it deserved.",positive
"""Wow this movie is the best #1.on my list and I think its the best James Bond movie ever. There was a lot of action and it had a great story line I loved it very much Daniel Craig is the best James Bond he did a great job.",positive
Best Bond ever...so far. Great action sequences though the card game does slow things down a bit.,positive
"Gritty, raw and a true prequel although the modernization tampers with eh ""prequality"" similar to the loss of prequel effect of Christian Bale's Batmans'. But, great. We have never seen Bond like this before. And it works. Still. Just give Mr. Bronsnan a facelift, or some cosmetics, and I will be even happier.",positive
Daniel Craig is a pleausre to watch- and the completely different approach to Bond film making is also refreshing,positive
"im a very big james bond fan. it was an awsome movie, but not my fav. james bond movie.",positive
The best Bond since Sean Connery.,positive
"Still should have been Baccarat instead of Texas Hold 'Em. This movie went on just slightly too long, and had one of the worst rationalizations for betrayal, and susceptibility to betrayal I've ever seen. Regardless, the best Bond movie in over a decade, and one of the top 3 of all time. Properly shows the violence that would surround the life of a man like Bond.",positive
Loved it .. can not believe I found a Bond that I like as well as Sean Connery! Looking forward to the next movie!,positive
Craig plays perhaps the most believable Bond character yet. Very well made and a refreshing change from the tired format of the last couple of Brosnan films.,positive
"I'm a huge James Bond fan and can say without hesitation that I've seen all the movies multiple times. I was hesitant about Daniel Craig, feeling that Pierce Brosnan was just about to take the character in some interesting directions. What I got was Craig doing that and more! The darkness of the character is a welcome change from some of the ""intermediate"" Bond characters and a fine return to the darker images of early Sean Connery and very late Pierce Brosnan. Bond is an assassin, a hired killer with little conscious, and we get to see that in this rendition, along with lots of raw, grainy, visceral action as opposed to antiseptic gadgets and one liners. Well done!",positive
"Not a huge James Bond fan, nor Daniel Craig -- but this movie hooked me! He is hot in this movie and the story line was great!",positive
I approve of Daniel Craig in the role... i'll share a vodka martini with him any time!,positive
"All people who dont like this film should be banned from the UK. There should be a section on James Bond in the UK citizenship test anyway. Come on, do your eally want to share a country with people who don't like James Bond?",positive
Even better the second time around. Can't wait for the next one.,positive
Great reinvention of 007.,positive
really really REALLY good bond flick. i loved it,positive
We all love dear James. :P,positive
I loved this movie and I normally hate bond movies! But the torture scene keeps me from buying it!,positive

Great continuation of the bond series.,negative
"First hour was great, second hour dragged. Overall pretty good",negative
Love all Bond movies!,positive
Better than Goldfinger! A bold statement... but it's true. The best Bond movie so far!,positive
I hate James Bond flicks,negative
"the story was ok, but it was worth watching cos of daniel craig yum yum!",positive
"The Best James Bond film to date. With large scale action, an epic story and great characters it's impossible to go wrong with this one. Daniel Criag is perfect as James Bond.",positive
The only Bond movie I've ever liked...,positive
daniel craig! yummy!,positive
the new bond is awesome,positive
"I have never liked a Bond film, until this one. Eva Green is the real person who completes this film",positive
"A good Bond film, but not my favourite. Decent script and good cast.",negative
"Probably one the best Bond movies to come to mind, Daniel Craig plays the role to perfection. A Bond that is not yet truly Bond, no gadgets, no Q, and not as suave as he thinks he is, Craig is a Bond who is discovering what it takes to be a double 0, the loss of relationships and the loss of trust. High stakes from beginning to end, Casino Royale does a great job of revamping the already stale series yet the new direction promises some classic Bond moments as well as some new twists I'm sure.",positive
"Un bon James, nerveux, brutal et qui ne vous laisse pas respirer. Pourquoi juste 4 ? Je regrette un peu le manque de sophistication de ce James lÃ  ainsi que les gadgets Ã  gogo, mais bon, ce n'est que le dÃ©but...",positive
Doesn't do much wrong.,negative
"the opening scene is hot!! the rest I don't really remember, or care to at least",negative
"Superb! - had my doubts about DC being Bond - but wow - he pulls it off SO well. It's dark, gritty and shows a side of Bond which we have not seen before. Roll on Quantum of Solice!",positive
i love james bond and the guy in it is hot too lol,negative
not the best bond but passable lol,negative
2 stars for Daniel Craig as Bond. Half a star for the plot.,negative
One of the better Bond films. Daniel Craig does a great job!,positive
"Bond is human after all. This is Bonds first mission as a 00-agent. Its fun, very intense, and soon becomes the man we all remember him as.",positive
"Daniel Craig lacks Sean Connery's easy charm, but he makes the other Bonds look like stick figures. This is the best of the Bond films. And o.m.g., Eva Green, Santa Madonna! My favorite scene is when she and Bond first meet: she sits down across from him, looks him square in the eye, and says, ""I'm the money.""",positive
Better than i thought. Daniel Craig is one of the best James Bonds in the franchises history!,positive
"ending is weak, but it's so much better than the recent crap that i don't really care. daniel craig is amazing!",positive
you just cant beat the golden oldies!,negative
Now tgis is more like it!! Bond as it should be. re-invented for today. Didnt think Daniel Craig would be this good.,positive
"very well made. i was skeptical, but i actually enjoyed it a lot",positive
This was much better than I thought it was going to be.,negative
"This is really what a James Bond should be, and it's quite a shame that it took them over forty years to get the formula right. Bond number six (I'm not counting David Niven in the spoof that shares this films title), Daniel Craig is introduced to us in what must rank as one of the greatest introductions to any action movie I have ever seen. We have a pre-credits monochrome flashback; in which Craig cold-bloodedly kills a corrupt MI6 official and his contact, followed by the innovative title sequence over which we have Chris Cornell's excellent theme song (which pisses over Madonna's god-awful Die Another Day warbling), and then what can only be described as the best on-foot chase sequence ever put to film. Yes, Casio Royale grabs your attention in the first few moments and simply refuses to let go. Where Pierce Brosin's movies seemed contrieved and unrealistic, Casino Royale is fast-moving, inventive and contemporary. Daniel Craig is actually very convincing as a cold and dangerous individual, and the villians are not the camp and ridiculous megalomaniacs of old. These people are not the kind of criminals who will boast about their ludicrous plans for world conquest whilst holding Bond at gunpoint. The pacing of the movie is spot on. Bond's mission to infiltrate the operations of a major terrorist fund-raiser takes him to a high stakes poker game in Montenegro and a number of tense confrontations with a network of powerful enemies. Borrowing elements from The Bourne Identity and 24, Casino Royale manages to be more exciting and action packed than it's influences and not just the best Bond movie for years. It's the best Bond movie, full stop.",positive
Daniel Craig. Shirtless. 'Nuff said.,positive
Gets away from the fill-in-the-blanks Bond script to make a real spy movie that's over-the-top and down-and-dirty.,positive
Bond at it's absolute best.. Craig gives us the suave super spy we've been missing since the days of Connery. A gritty and realistic return to the big screen for 007. Flashy gadgets and invisible cars have been replaced by cunning brutality. This movie will stand the test of time.,positive
No this is closer to the Bond I want I just wish it were ever grittier and more real.,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond by far he is gritty real and sooo sexy,positive
i actually liked this movie. even though it seems that most people didn't.,positive
"I loved this movie, i've watched it like three or four times in less than two days",positive
"The first 2/3 of it are great, the last 1/3 sucks.",negative
excellent can't wait for sequel,positive
"Much better than the last few Bond movies. Good action and Daniel Craig does a good job. The story didn't always flow that well, though.",negative
"Lets face it, he's no George Lazenby.",negative
Ok ok... tenia tiempo sin ver una buena pelicula de accion...,positive
Big fan of hardcore Bond. Bigger fan of Moonraker. LASERS.,positive
gritty bond not the polished b/s you normally get,positive
Seemed a little less like a bond film and more like a Mission Impossible film - it was a good movie and I recommend it.,negative
OH Yeah! THE best BOND ever!!!!Daniel Craig is no pretty boy Bond...he's hot & kicks major arse!,positive
NOt bad for a Bond flick. Got a little distracted by Daniel Craig's jug ears....,negative
Best Bond film as far as I'm concerned,positive
The chase scenes at the beginning were awesome...reminded me of some HK action movies. But the energy sort of dissipated towards the last hour of the movie. Not a bad movie...will watch it again.,negative
"All in all, a really good movie. I don't know if I'm sold on Daniel Craig as Bond yet though.",positive
"I'm not normally into James Bond but Daniel Craig certainly has something to make me watch. I loved it, from the free running to the love story. Fab. :-)",negative
"The best Bond movie ever made! True to the story n characters all the way til the end. As spy movies should be! Director, Composer, actors all made an outstanding performance!",positive
"The opening free running scene is fantastic - really got me hooked. I'm not a huge fan of the Bond movies, but this one pulled me in.",positive
"La peor película Bond de todas, todo parece irreal, no creible, y los efectos especiales son una chapuza. Este actor no vale para Bond, parece ruso y no da la talla.",negative
The best bond without doubt. Dark and real. Loved it,negative
"One of the best Bond films yet. It's gritty, and that's what we need; plus, Daniel Craig looks like he could actually do the things 007 does on screen. Not that I need to mention it but, anyone else want to vote Eva Green the hottest Bond Girl EVER?",positive
One movie critic hailed this bond to be the best bond movie ever. Aparently he/she hasn't seen other bond movies.,negative
Daniel Craig is pretty boring.,negative
"At first I wanted to be all, ""No way, they can't do this to Bond!"" But then I saw the film and was blown away.",positive
i love james bond. Gotta love the action and romance!,positive
"I never rated this until now, but this movie was awesome. Better than Brosnan's Bond movies and some sweet action, not just a bunch of gadgets and gizmos!",positive
"I'm not a bond fan, but this was alright",negative
Me gusto full. Me gustan las pelis de James Bond por los gadgets y todo eso.,positive
"This movie was just plain awesome. I havent seen many bond movies, but this one was just amazing",positive
Sweet Movie. Daniel Craig is Great.,positive
Loved it! Gives a great perspective of how life and death play out...I love the shower scene because it's such a humbling scene...And M plays an amazing role! I love her movies! I can't wait for more...,positive
Well that was different.,negative
Daniel Craig is so hot and there's plenty of action.,positive
Wow what a sexy film! Jesus that intro is awesome! WHAT!? chris cornell? wow... a bit long winded but wow! a must see for non and bond fans! this brings it home all the way,positive
"""Mr. White? We need to talk.""",negative
"The best Bond movie so far. I love the gritter, darker James Bond take.",positive
"I'm not a huge fan of Bond films, I've only ever seen three of the old ones. But, this one was awesome! The plot and characters alike, make this a 'must see!'",positive
"Boring, Dats wat I can say.",negative
This was my favorite move of 2006 - and I am not even a Bond fan!,positive
"I am now a Bond fan, Mr Craig is wonderful in the role.",positive
just falls apart when he wakes up after being tortured... up till then it's the best Bond movie ever...,negative
"Trois B; James bond est BLOND, Daniel Craig est BEAU, ce film c'est de la BOMBE.",positive
"Since Goldeneye, Bond has gone through a downward spiral ending with Die Another Day which could almost be as bad as the horrifically made On Her Majesty's Secret Service. However, it is a case of take out the old and bring in the new with Daniel Craig really shining in the role as the illustrious spy. There is significant differences in this film compared with the older Bond movies in that the story is sharper, dialogue is wittier and the suave of 007 is back in action. Eva Green plays an attractive and non-Bond girl-esque type of sidekick. The villain is perhaps a bit too villainous as in all scarred and out with a vengence type. What amazes me most was the action sequences. The chase intro and several other high octane scenes really had me going. A thrill ride and proving that the Bond franchise has not died.",positive
im not a bo fan never seen any ofthe but wheni watche this with a few friends and i left my mind open to this movie and i loved it!!,positive
Absolute Genius! Finally a James Bond we can be thrilled by/about and not the laughable caricature this icon had become in the last few movies.,positive
craig is an awesome bond,positive
Great rebirth of the series!,positive
"Maybe it was the beer, or maybe I'm just stupid, but I just couldn't keep the characters and story straight. I loved the opening parkour scene, but the last 20 minutes felt ancillary and tiresome.",negative
"Good enjoyable film, fairly different to the book, but good none the less. And Eva Green looks hot! :)",negative
Excellent. Really captures the Ian Fleming character.,positive
"The structure differs from other Bond movies, which was refreshing. But it offers nothing more.",negative
"While this Bond lacks some of the humour, Casino Royal is a decent film with a little more romantic depth than expected.",negative
Fun. Daniel Craig is a great Bond.,positive
oh i do love M and Craig is gorgeous of course,negative
"despite the monotony of the james bond series, this film was actually captivating t o a certain degree",negative
"Excellent, already more of a fan of 007 than any of the Brosnan films.",positive
A very promising reboot for bond,positive
Really good Bond movie!!,positive
"Loved this latest Bond film, wasn't sure about a blonde Bond, but Daniel Craig proved us all wrong. Such agression & excellent fight scenes. Thumbs up.",positive
Definitely a different bond movie than I expected and the multiple climaxes(I know what you're thinking!) in the movie definitely gave it a twist!,positive
this is a more vulnerable james bond than we've ever seen in previous bond movies.....there's a more human side to him......it's an ok movie - slightly too long for my liking.,negative
"Favorite of the Bond movies, I hate Pearce Brosnen.",negative
Daniel Craig is the ultimate Bond,positive
the best bond movie ever did think he could pull off bond but it was awesome,negative
Really smart redefinition of the Bond story. Watching Craig's character ride the edge to breaking point holds attention - plus you've got Mads Mikkelsen as a fantastic foil.,negative
"The best James Bond movie ever, and probably one of the best movies of the last 10 years. Excellent.",positive
Texas Hold'em - bring it on James.,positive
"Daniel Craig is a total bad-A and he brings a new toughness to the Bond series, which I was very happy to see. The early chase scene in this movie is pure awesome, and I love the tension in the room during the high-stakes poker game. You will quickly learn to love the rougher, yet still smooth James Bond. The only thing that keeps this movie from being scored even higher for me were a few parts where I did not feel like I knew 100% what was going on, or what the characterrs were talking about. This seems to be pretty standard in Bond movies though, and Casino Royale is easily the best one I have seen, out of probably 10 or so.",positive
"Daniel Craig is a great Bond. The movie itself, however, is way too over hyped. I feel that I would have enjoyed it more had I not had much too high expectations to begin with. Still, it is better than most.",negative
"An awesome Bond film that brings the series out of its current lull. Well done film with Daniel Craig securing the role of Bond for the next few years, in my opinion.",positive
A fantastic revitalisation of the Bond series after it began to stagnate under Pierce Brosnan,positive
"daniel craig makes this film, its aqn added bonus that he got in to some trunks",positive
"Le meilleur James Bond depuis bien longtemps, enfin! Daniel Craig est bien plus charismatique que Pierce Brosnan. Mais Ã§a ne vaut quand mÃªme pas les premiers James Bond.",negative
"Nothing special, actually a boring movie with one great part - when Solange steals him money, it was so funny for me! Then, there is a lot of action and a lot of love. James is as always incredible, he nearly dies two times!",negative
all I have to say is there is free-style walking in this!,positive
"Ovo je dosadna reklama za sony-ericsson mobilne telefone.2,5 sata zivota otislo u nepovrat...",negative
"awesome origin story, love how he has to earn the double o status. still, he is no Sean Connery.",positive
"The best Bond since Connery, HANDS DOWN.",positive
"Yes, yes. A nude James Bond, you have to like it!",positive
"the ""that's why I think I love you"" bit was, well, stupid. However, the rest of the film was A+.",negative
Loved this movie! Daniel is a great Bond..... I think he is truer to the books than the other Bonds. Can't wait for the next Daniel Craig Bond flick.,positive
One of the best Bond films with real content. James Bond is played with aplomb by a great actor. JB in love? What a refreshing idea.,negative
i love the theme music,positive
"This movie got a lot of buzz and when I finally saw it, I didn't understand why. Daniel Craig isn't bad at trying to be Bond, but it doesn't work.",negative
Bond is back and he is bad ass!,positive
"Action-packed, but lacks the wit of early Bond movies.",negative
The only Bond film I've ever seen and it was good.,positive
As a James Bond Film This sucked.,negative
"My very first James Bond movie!?! Not as bad as I was afraid of, but no need to see any other one",negative
"Daniel Craig makes a good Bond, but I was just not a fan of the movie.",negative
APLA TELEIOS!!!!!!!!!,positive
confusing... had me and a friend getting ready to leave 3 times when it dumped in all the fake endings... END ONCE YOU SILLY FILM,negative
"cant wait for the next Bond movie. Daniel Craig is a bit of a different Bond. More of a loose cannon. He seems like more of a ""bad guy"" Bond but still playing for the good guys. All in all it was a pretty good movie. There is a bit of humor in it and as always a few ""unreal"" or ""unbelievable"" bits but what movie doesnt?",negative
"It was hard for me to get into the mindframe that this was the 'beginning' of Bond's career, and I'm easy to convince in general. I missed all the gadgets... But all in all it was a good action movie, hadn't seen one of those in a while.",negative
Gets 5 for being the best Bond flick in quite some time. Kan nie glo ek het so lank gevat om dit te kyk nie...,positive
Too drawnout for 007,negative
"The best Bond in a very long time. He's rough, he's tough, and he's got subtle in-jokes about his future self. A ""crackling"" good film. I also was surprised how much I enjoyed the title song by Chris Cornell, and then disapppointed to discover it isn't on the soundtrack album.",positive
hAWT!!!! omg!! omg!!! i can haz?,positive
This is THE best 007 movie ever! the scene on the roof at the start is amazing! Daniel Craig is THE best 007 ever!,positive
"excellent movie, gosh he has a nice bod!",positive
A welcome departure from the series's past to pull bond out of another rut.,positive
"Its Daniel Craig's acting and Martin Campbell's direction which saves the day, although I still personally dont qualify Craig as a potential contender for James Bond mainly because of his height but he is certainly a better actor then Pierce Brosnan....",negative
"Finally, after a decade of silliness, somebody decides to take the character of James Bond seriously again. Brilliant from start to finish. The true essence of James Bond was never the gadgets or the cars or the women, well maybe the women, but it was the character himself. Instead of treating James as a wisecracking action star, the writers finally decided to treat him like a man. Bravo.",positive
"Best Bond film I've seen in a while. Some of the action sequences feel a bit gratuitous, but it's good fun.",positive
"deffinatly the best bond movie i ever seen, im not saying that brosman wasnt good but the serie needed a change, and thats a very good one and who cares if hes blond?",positive
"Brosnan is the real Bond. That being said, very smooth.",positive
I really like this new james bond,negative
I am sorry I ever doubted the Blond Bond.,positive
excellent movie...Daniel Craig is simply .....fabulicious!!!!,positive
renewed my faith in 007,negative
Great Action. Great Movie. Can't wait for the next one.,positive
Not bad. Unfairly criticised I think.,negative
Inte ofta det killar i pungen nÃ¤r man ser pÃ¥ film men fighten i byggnadstÃ¤llningen i bÃ¶rjan av filmen...woaw...,positive
Second viewing confirms this as the best Bond film of the lot and Craig as the best Bond. The ridiculously-titled Quantum of Solace can't come soon enough.,positive
Some say this isn't classic Bond. I don't care. This movie was great.,positive
Best Bond - Daniel Craig gives Sean Connery a run for his money - more real more action and more powerful than the other movies - and I wont even mention the scene where he walks out the waves!,positive
Confusing.... Kaitlin thought so also.,negative
"If you can suspend your disbelief as a guy with a pistol fends off multiple guys with machine guns (multiple times), you'll like this film. If not, pass on it.",positive
Daniel Craig...mmmm need i say more!!,positive
"brilliant. after a few watches, seems a little long by the time you get to venice. but so perfected, and well-made we shan't complain. could write a book on all the things that this film done right. how can anyone make a poker game SO entertaining?? deducted half a star on account of the fact that - in all fairness - Bourne wipes the floor in comparison. to anything. ever.",positive
"Enjoyable, but somehow this doesn';t feel like the James Bond we have come to know. Daniel Craig feels like another MI6 agent whom just happens to have the same name. Also, what happened to R and Moneypenny? Good story though.",negative
I'd rather watch OSS 117. Richard Sammel was the best part of this (overrated) movie.,negative
Awesome movie! The action was good.,positive
I loved it! Great chase scene early in the movie....so intense. I'm looking forward to the next one. I want to watch it again to see what I missed the first time around.,positive
i liked him as bond didnt think i would. very good action scene opening was great.a little to much on the card playing though,negative
Quite good. Craig stays true to the Bond persona while the movie delivers amazing action sequences set amidst an interesting plot that's full of the regular 007 villains and romances,positive
awsome......couldn't get much better,positive
i love the beach scene,positive
"This might be my favorite Bond movie. Honestly, the only one I liked was Goldfinger, most of them bore me. This was so well done and action packed it could be a great relaunch to the series. It reminded me more of the Bourne movies and a Ludlum novel I just read (The Janson Directive).",positive
"[color=black]Probably one of the best Bond films yet, but thats not really saying much as 90% of them are terrible (any Bond film with Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan in it).[/color] [color=#000000]The film decides to take a modern approach and leaves the cold era and goes into a new threat, terrorism. [/color] [color=#000000]Its interesting to see after all these years, that a film finally bothers itself to tell Bond's history instead of doing the usual bloody routine that includes, a super bad guy, a silly plot and some sexy women (a good thing really). [/color] [color=#000000]Bond still a bit rough around the edges as M says to him 'he's a blunt instrument' but he certainly turns out to be the sharpest tool at the end of the film. [/color] [color=#000000]Daniel Craig's perfromance is cold and unsympathetic, he doesn't give a corny joke like Roger Moore did and does his own stunts. Bond bleeds, sweats and cries out in pain, the film shows that Bond is still human and is failable.[/color] [color=#000000]The film however suffers from a terrible villian, the film is too busy focusing on the new hero that it forgot about making a decent villian. The villian is Le Chriffe, he has no special powers except playing poker and torturing people (in the er sensitive parts), to show he's a bad man he weeps blood out of his eye. [/color] [color=#000000]The film strays away from the action scenes and continues focusing on Bond's character, but they are some notable action scenes such as the parkour sequence earlier on the film which was filmed in Madagasgar. [/color] [color=#000000]Most Bond films have that urgent feel in it suggesting the world in is in threat if the baddies suceed but in Casino Royale lacks that feel of urgency, it doesn't really feel like a great loss if Bond lost to Le Chriffe in a poker game. The whole world rest in the balance of a poker game, yeah right. [/color]",positive
Really good action film with a great twist at the end and memorable one liners. Am looking forward to the next one.,negative
"Great Bond movie, worth a look.",positive
"Daniel Craig makes an impressive debut as the new 007. I was pleased that the script seemed to draw inspiration from the earlier Sean Connery films rather than the some-times slap-stick Roger Moore films. Gone are the ridiculous stunts and cheap laughs, and back is the intrigue and witty dialogue. My main complaints with the film center around the fact that the traditional ""Bond"" elements are a bit too understated and the cool gadgets were lacking. I also thought that the game of wits at the poker table had unexplored potential. I also didn't like the fact that they played up the love story angle -- Bond never gets that attached to a woman. Overall, I'm looking forward to seeing Daniel Craig in the next Bond film and was pleased that at least this Bond film didn't make a mockery of the franchise. Well done.",negative
"Probably the best of the series, and Craig is arguably the best to play the role of Bond. A grittier, much more realistic plot than the earlier films. The gimmick, of course, is the series' relaunch, allowing us to see a young Bond who's just earned his license to kill and is capable of making mistakes. It works well here, and should continue somewhat into ""Quantum of Solace,"" but Bond definitely undergoes a serious pile of character development here, and that should be reflected in future films. Bond the character is at his most interesting here, with much of the film dedicated to showing us how and why he turns into the superspy we all know he'll become. An orphaned bundle of cocksure damaged goods who learns some very painful lessons about trust, it's now easy to see how he becomes the philandering killing machine (though the tendencies were all well in place to start with). Easily the most emotionally resonant Bond film as well. The standout action sequence is the beginning chase between Daniel Craig and parkour founder Sebastien Foucan, which rivals Tony Jaa's level of athleticism. Watch for this, the hotness of Eva Green, and the heartwrenching car wreck (it's a beautiful machine, and it's painful to watch it crash). For dedicated fans of the series, compare Craig's performance to that of the underrated Timothy Dalton, who easily performed the coldest, most brutal Bond until now. Recommended without qualification. See it, or if you have already, see it again.",positive
Best Bond flick in a long time!,positive
Best Bond Movie at least since Connery.,positive
intelligent movie...awesome logical progression,positive
"let's be frank. daniel craig is not a handsome sexy bond. but it is refreshing, just like the movie itself. still the cool,confident spy, yet he has weakness, he has feelings, his feelings changes as the movie proceeds, just like his audience. then at the very end, he dress just like the other bonds, and delivery the famous line: the bond is complete. i look forward to see the next movie.",positive
Best Bond ever!!!!!!!,positive
"I was disappointed. Daniel Craig is not going to be near my favorite bond - he's like #4, only out-ranking Timothy Dalton. and that was close. I just felt like they didn't capture the things I lied most about 007 movies... had a higher expectation...",negative
I like Brosnan better as a Bond,negative
The best Bond in recent years. Great action and well packaged entertainer. Eva Green is HOT!!!,positive
Jason Bourne would get his ass kicked by James Bond. The end.,positive
"se bond riendose de james bond. es una buena pelicula, pero la he visto muchas veces en los buses",negative
"One of, if not, my favorite Bond movies and Bonds.",positive
Fantastic action flick. Good storyline. I thought the ending was a bit stretched out too long...,negative
"One of the best James Bond's movie ever made, IMHO.",positive
"I'll give it 3 stars (which is good). I thought parts of the airport scene was a bit ridiculous. Here's a guy who's driving recklessly at an airport which should be getting highest security these days and it seems there's only 3 police/security cars after him? Anyway, I give kudos for trying a different approach to Bond, and Daniel Craig did an admirable job. Looking forward to the next one. I think I could have gone for fewer product placements, though.",negative
"This is about the only James Bond movie I actually sat through, followed the whole storyline, and enjoyed. I don't know but it just felt more realistic and human to me compared against the whole franchise. It leaned much more toward reality than fantasy (i.e., fancy gadgets, complicated techonlogy, ridiculous name-sounding villians, and bedding multipule women at one time). I think the best part had to be the card game.",positive
Mucha accion y sentimientos intensos. Quizas la mejor de Bond.,positive
The only James Bond movie that I've ever not been bored watching. And the only attractive James Bond.,positive
ok so i thought he would suck at first but he is acdcutally a very good bond Brosnan is best but this guy is good too.,positive
Great changed the bond franchise,positive
omg top film! i thought this film could not b as gd as the others but it was as gd if not better! i wanted to applaud at the end! well done Daniel! lookin 4ward 2 ur 2nd film.,positive
"One of, if not the best bond film eva!!",positive
Best Bond film since Goldeneye.,positive

Best Bond movie ever!,positive
Damn that man is sexy.,positive
I dont like Daniel Craig as Bond,negative
"Not a bad movie, but it just doesn't feel at all like a bond film.",negative
Best Bond yet. I thought Daniel Craig was a perfect choice (despite the critics!,positive
"Cool movie, Daniel Craig performance was awesome!",positive
"Good action, Bond kicks ass. The new guy pulls of the kind of attitude I'd expect from someone in Bond's line of work. Two issues - First - the torture scene I could've done without... I mean, it added to Bond's kickassitude and snarkiness, but really... most guys will agree that skin flaying or some such would be preferred. Second - The end. I would've been much happier had the movie ended 20 or so minutes earlier. I didn't need all of that sappy stuff at the end, and felt that it dragged the movie down from it's peak. It's kind of like AI that way.",positive
"This is an obscenely good action movie. Great actors, great locale, great special effects, great stunts, hot Bond girls; it had it all. Daniel Craig is an awesome James Bond. I look forward to seeing more from this era of the series.",positive
"Daniel Craig IS BOND!He's a badass that dosen't rely on shitty gadgets like that faggot pierce Brosnan.I love the fact that he pretty much killed like 10 guys with his bare hands.That's what a man does.A man doesn't use a gay wristwatch-laser or an Aston Martin with machine guns, he beats a bitch down with his bare hands.And another thing, James Bond is'nt supposed to be some gangly shrimp, he's supposed to be cut to the max and ready to punch anyone in the face at anytime.The whole love lost thing with Vesper Lynd was genius.Now we know why Bond never falls in love....because when he lost the woman he loved he turned into a loveless killing machine...AWESOME! Quantum of Solace is gonna be a must-watch for me!",positive
"One of my favourite Bond films... and the newest. There you go, I suppose.",positive
good revival of bond genre,negative
"A well done reset/continuation of the series, the only confusing part being M played by Dame Judi Dench - if this is first mission, why have her as M? But that's a tiny thing people can overlook.",positive
the best Bond ever!!!!,positive
"Total departure from the normal ""Boxing Day"" James Bond type films, this is much more grown up, and if you are a bloke there's a scene that will have you near to tears! Enjoy.",positive
worst torture scene ever,positive
"If you have fun with movies in the"" Bond"" category , this is it! I enjoyed every minute of it. Some will say that reveals my personality, (cracy) but some people will have the Bond experience - like me! ENJOY - LIKE COKE! Oskar",positive
Blonde Bonds are more fun. To watch.,positive
"""Welcome back, James Bond!"" is what many fans will say after seeing this absolutely enthralling movie masterpiece that deserves a top seat in the legendary catalog of great spy thrillers. Well, I couldn't agree more.",positive
it was so cool!wow!!,positive
Maybe the best Bond film ever...,positive
"After watching Goldfiner, I didn't think it was possible for a bond film to get any better. I was wrong.",positive

The best Bond. True to the book. Cold. Ruthless. Killer.,positive
"Finally a real James Bond movie, no superficial full of bullshit that weâve being seeing, over the past 30 years now, except the ones of Timothy Dalton! A Big applauds for the Eon productions Team, and what a comeback for director Martin Campbell.",positive
in fact it was my first james bond film :P c'Ã©tait pas mal!,negative
I'm glad they rebooted Bond this way. I prefer it to any of the Bourne movies.,negative
"This was a great movie. I like how they were able to personify Bond both as someone who was the best at what he does and a human being who can experience grief or pain. I loved it! Plus, Craig is just a sight for sore eyes :]",positive
"It lacked action, it lacked the usual duo of Bond girls, it lacked all the high tech gadgetry that Pierce Brosnan made famous from Goldeneye to Die Another Day, all that, and Casino Royale is still one of the best Bond films i've ever seen. Second only to either Goldeney or Tomorrow Never Dies, as both are tied for my favorite Bond movie.",positive
The best 007 movie I've seen.,positive
"if they can make 4 more bond films like this, it just might make up for, oh, one brosnan addition.",positive
"Some people might not agree that he has the personality of a 007 in this movie, very reckless and brutal but I think this is what the new age 007 should be like. NO MORE PLEASANTRIES",positive
This movie is okay for a one time only viewing.,negative
Bond is back! Thank you for holding back on the scifi stuff which ruined the one before this one. Would have gotten 4 stars had it not been for Mads Mikkelsen.,negative
"Loved it! This was kind of the Batman Begins of Bond films - much darker and more serious than prior Bond films (though it's closer in tone to the very early Connery movies than anything else IMO). A bit overlong and not entirely well-paced (like so many movies nowadays), but still highly recommended. I look forward to more Craig/Bond outings.",positive
not the best Bond movie but Eva Green is smokin' hot!,negative
"IMO this is quite possibly the best Bond movie to date. It stays true to the original aspects of the character and solid story, cast and director to boot. Extremely entertaining. Although it doesn't follow the novel exactly it does pick up many aspects and transports them into modern times. Breathtaking effects and a climatic finish make this one of the best movies of the year.",positive
"D'habitude je hais les James Bond (dsl Dood) mais celui-la ,a vrai dire il passe... pour une fois que James est blond, qu'il se fait mal, a des problemes avec un ego surdimensionne et eprouve des sentiments... en +, un generique de debut tres graphique !! Visuellement, ca claque !",negative
"Daniel Craig didn't exactly win me over as James Bond. He was human to the point that I almost never had faith in him. The plot wasn't too enthralling either, too few characters. The villain was at least villainous looking, though he was kind of a bad villain. I wanted to sing ""now I wanna be your dog"" during the poker scenes. I forgot this was a Bond movie throughout the entire thing, until the end when he gave his name.",negative
i love the conversation between bond n lynd~,positive
Blonde Bond? not in my America.,negative
Superb. Re-invents and revitalizes the Bond saga.,positive
"Ok, I'll get my beef out of the way first. Daniel Craig didn't strike me as James Bond. I'm sorry, thats just how I felt. Not a bad actor or anything, just different. With that said, I thought the movie kicked butt. It had the adrenaline pumping, quick paced action of a Jason Bourne movie, but with a more refined, smooth feel appropriate for its protagonist. Not to say that this movie is elegant, no way. Bond has a hard edge to him this time around, he's a guy that doesn't have to depend on gadgets or girls to get him out of a scrape (well, most of the time), he fights hard, runs harder, and is perseverant to the extreme. If it didn't have 007 in the title, this would have felt a lot like a totally new series, but the awesome thing is that it balances with near perfection the realism of the fights and tense, expository scenes with the bombast of Bond. The villain isn't a crazy billionaire intent on world domination, he's merely and underworld banker searching to regain a poor investment. The Bondiose touch? He cries blood when his is agitated. A couple of gadgets even make their appearance, though they are not the focus of this outing, likewise Q is nowhere to be seen. But the tale of Bond's transition to a 00 agent and his first mission is really easy to watch. Craig isn't as smoot as Connery nor quite as Dashing as Pierce Brosnan, but thats what one would expect before Bond became the tuxedoed ladykiller of the movie history. Enjoy this movie immensely, you must, just don't come in expecting ""Goldfinger.""",positive
I'm not a big J.B. fan but this is the best movie I've seen in the series.,positive
"Aaron and I watched this on DVD a few weeks ago. I am not really a fan of James Bond movies, but everyone I know who had seen this told me I'd love it...so, when Aaron asked if I wanted to watch it with him (otherwise, he watches the movies I'm not interested in during the day while I'm at work), I told him I did. According to IMDb, the movie is about: ""In his first mission, James Bond must stop Le Chiffre, a banker to the world's terrorist organizations, from winning a high-stakes poker tournament at Casino Royale in Montenegro."" This was Daniel Craig's first turn as James Bond...and I was skeptical that a blue eyed blond could pull it off. I shouldn't have worried. He did very well. Not only did he do well, he made the character his own. Unlike many of the other actors who have played James Bond, Mr. Craig didn't bother with the debonair pretenses. He played the character as a rough and tumble dude...with skills (AKA: skillz). There were some gadgets, but they didn't overwhelm (or take over) the film like some previous Bond flicks. There was a more in depth love story than I ever recall there being. There was action, but it wasn't an over the top violence-fest. A good portion of the movie was centered around a poker table...something I'm familiar with. It was enjoyable to watch him reading people. I definitely liked this one. I wouldn't say I loved it, though. Certainly worth the rental fee. Check it out! (Reviewed 5/2/07)",negative
"New bond, new style. Much like what Batman Begins did for its series - Casino does to the 007 series. Reinvented in a good way. More realistic than previous installments and with a lot more heart.",positive
Bedste Bond-film. SÃ¥dan.,positive
"Better then Connery (In this era, don't kill me) xP",positive
Now we're talking. Bond is back to being a thug with a thin veneer of civility over him.,positive
"Really good movie, but i don't like Daniel Craig as James Bond. He dosn't really got the ""bond style"" in him. Besides that we'r missing some persons and details in this one. But besides that, this movie got it all, cars, chicks, drinks, money, shootign, and ofc a bad guy ;)",positive
"This is a genuine Bond film, its a real contender with the best Connery offerings.",positive

Daniel Craig........!!!!!,positive
Who doesn't like a bond movie! But Daniel Craig make an excellent bond. (It does help that he's hot!) One of my favorites.,positive
One of the best bond films so far!,negative

It was pretty much what I expected it to be. I liked the characters, who were acted well for the most part. And the end, unless it was just setting up for a sequel, was actually pretty good in an unconventional way.[/color][/size][/font]",negative
A wonderful series reboot.,negative
"Lots of hype, delivers the most of it. Well, they are gonna screw the next, I'm sure.",positive
Damn fine Bond movie,positive
"Fantasic prequel to the movies. Craig is a great actor, who makes the role real without being cocky. My favorite bond so far. I actually felt sorry for Bond. Great cast and plot.",positive
"Meget bra actionfilm, og det skal sies at det skal litt til for Ã¥ imponere meg pÃ¥ den fronten. Mads Mikkelsen er sÃ¥nn superskurkete skurk, og Mr. Craig er herrlig glÃ¦tt!",positive
i think daniel craig is one of the best bonds to date,positive
Not a Bond fan but this made me change my mind. Good action film that kicks Bourne's ass!!!,positive
very v good best james bond film yet,positive
not bad.. only watched it cos it was the free blu ray with the ps3 :),negative
"I think everyone loves this film except me. I think the reason is because I feel cheated by it really. See the reason being is that Tarantino actually came up with making this movie, the studio was yeah we like it etc etc and then they can him and make this film which really is a poor mans Bourne! A good new direction but can you imagine what Tarantino would of done? It would of been the Star Wars of Spy Films!",negative
"I will say that I was one of the skeptics about Daniel Craig playing Bond, but I was surprised at how good of a job he did. I don't know if it was him, or the direction that the movie was taken, but it's so good to see a Bond that's not by any means perfect. He makes mistakes and quite a few of them. There's also a pretty good play on what you expect from Bond movies. I'm not one to usually quote movies in my reviews, but I have to for this one. Bond: Vodka-martini. Bartender: Shaken or stirred? Bond: Do I look like I give a damn? Best line in the entire movie. There's a whole lot less action in it, and there's more suspense spent on the card game, which once again a whole new direction for a Bond movie. I look forward to seeing where the new Bond takes us.",positive
"What an excellent movie!! Loved loved loved it. Although I got lost at some point and I just can't take this ""women- are-the-great-deciever"" bits. It was nevetheless Highly entertaining. Fast paced and engaging!",positive
"It doesnt feel long or as epic as most Bond films, but it is definately better then the last one.",positive
Best Bond movie in years,positive
"nice, but D looked like the bad guy from the first time.",positive
"I don't think this film gets as much credit as it deserves. Daniel Craig is very good in his first 'Bond' role, and Dame Judi Dench is as fantastic as ever. There are some brilliant stunt scenes in the first 20 minutes to half an hour and it does have an interesting plot to it. I didn't think I would enjoy this film as much as I did but I was surprised.",positive
"Una de las mejores, lejos Craig devuta como casi al mismo nivel que Sean Connry",positive
"It was alright... kind of predictable, but it was still really good. Daniel Craig is the best Bond so far, in my opinion. He played the role perfectly.",negative
"I Love it. I like a Bond who seems like he could take a hit to the jaw. Brosnan just seemed like you could punch him out in one go. Craig is like Sean Connery's true successor. I also dug how many times I thought the movie was over, only to be surprised by another epic firefight.",positive
"is my favourite bond film, and now daniel craig is my favourite bond too.",positive
"Daniel Craig is my favourite Bond - he's the only one who isn't totally suave and slimy, which always put me off the rest of the Bond films!",positive
a bond as good as connery's bond,positive
"Lets face it, most pre-Casino Royale Bond's were disposable, lightweight spy-romps. Daniel Craig as Bond and director Martin Campbell steal some energy from the Bourne franchise with this great reinvention of Flemings secret agent.",positive
a nice improvement.. this certainly brings james bond into the 21st century,positive
"The best parts were in the casino and at the poker tables. That's where all the tension was. Not much in terms of action. Just a foot chase in Madagascar, and a fuel tank fight at Miami International. The ending was overstretched, and finished with a mildly climactic falling building in Venice. The soundtrack was really good. It matched the new bold and wild character of Bond.",negative
"was pretty good, not a huge fan of agent 007's new personification.",positive
"Far too serious for a Bond movie. They've been silly from the get-go, why start taking it seriously now?",negative
"Not normailly a fan of 007 but this really took me, I was hooked from the previews and sincde seeing it I'm looking forward to the next. Daniel Craig is a less poncy Bond in a role that shows 007s earlier and darker self.",positive
"By far the best Bond, the script is so Dark and Daniel Craig imbodied such a new (and needed after the amazing Bourne series) angle that Casino Royale can't even be compared to the other movies in the franicise. Its first in the series to not focus on the ""coolest-new-gadget"" but an in-depth storyline.",positive
Bond is back!Better that ever.,positive
"Did not find it as ironic as people told me. Too much actions and poor dialogues, even if some of them are funny.... prefer the old ones...",negative
"After 20 parts of James Bond that was a little bit different. Maybe because of relationship with woman? But damn...ending was sad. Poor James, poor.",negative
"Not a big fan of 007, but this was good. Different direction from other movies.",positive
"In my opinion the BEST James Bond and Bond Flick. It broke away from the impossible stunts and gadgets, though still loving the old ones and for that reason, I think this is the best bond for this time. I absolutely loved the plot, phenominal! some scenes i could'nt predict what was going to happen.",positive
"Kinda predictable. Probably didn't like it that much due to the fact that everyone told me it was great. Basically just like any other Bond movie, ah well...",negative
"Excellent movie!, To me the Bond movie yet. I is a complete package: romance, action, suspense.... all in one. Definitely, it is a must see.",positive
BEST! JAMES! BOND! MOVIE! EVER!,positive
"Really disappointing. If they had guts they would have made this an R-rated movie and cast Clive Owen as Bond. Craig does okay, but he's not exactly suave. His humanized side never should have been shown. What were they thinking?",negative
ingen overraskelser.. Enkelt og greitt,positive
Daniel Craig is a good James Bond. For the most part this movie kept my attention. Except that it dragged a little in the end.,positive
"I am a long time Bond fan and this is one of, if not THE best ever. Zero camp-factor, and he gets the crap beaten out of him many many times. Rugged, tragic, realistic Bond.",positive
I still don't know if Daniel Craig is the right choice for the new face of BOND,negative
What can i say - Bond is back better and badder,positive
"Daniel Craig looks quite promising as bond...very well done. I like the simplicity and crude nature of bond in this movie (driving a ford and the martini ""do i look like i give a damn""), but i guess this is all in the process of making bond a refined killing machine. nevertheless very well done movie excellent action sequences with the parkour. in short a must see movie.",positive
"And finally, the real James Bond comes to screen, the cold and brutal secret agent as visualised by Ian fleming, but lacking the polished charm. Barring goldeneye, i always found pierce brosnan's bond to be a softie type, daniel craig looks like an animal in comparison to brosnan but that could be the whole point. Thanks to martin campbell and daneil craig, the franchise that was sinking deeper into ouright ridiculousness has been give the much needed shot in the arm...",positive
Best Bond film by far!!!!,positive
"It's nice to see a Bond who can make mistakes (because he's still NEW!). Daniel Craig takes a little getting used to, but I think with some time and another movie, viewers will get used to his style. The film pulls us in, and even though it's well over two hours, it goes by fast. Enjoyable!",positive
"The Bond idea has always intrigued me, but I find the films so boring, but I gave this a shot because I heard good things and it seemed like it might make the Bond thing interesting for once. Everything I despise about Bond films was absent. No ridiculous villains, no perfect hero, and no easy ways out. Everything has an effect; in the olds days Bond could blow up a building and hear nothing from his superiors. Now the rules are different. Daniel Craig gets beat up in every way possible and he is like Indiana Jones in that he wins with his wits and physical skills. He also has deep flaws and he is without a doubt a brutal man, as any agent who does what Bond does would be. Also we finally get espionage scenes in Africa. I've been waiting for that for a long time. In conclusion this is one of the best action films ever made and Craig is by far the best Bond. Yes, I find Connery a bore, but Moore and Brosnan were worse. It is worth noting that, outside of one film with Dalton, this is the only real attempt to make the Bond of the books into a celluloid character.",positive
"Whenever Bond gets too silly, it's always refreshing to change the style of the films and the Bond himself. Examples include the retarded Moonraker, the hilariously bad On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the immensely dull Living Daylights and he preposterous Die Another Day. Now it's Daniel Craig's time to put on the bow tie, and surprisingly he does a darn good job with it. Casino Royal boasts a fantastic opening sequence, a cool vilain, a strong story and relentless action. It's not perfect but it's a great start for the new Bond. The product-placement is unforgivable though.",positive
Bond with a bod and no chest hair ... welcome to the 21st century,positive
"Although I fell asleep the second time I saw it, it is worth seeing just for the heads up poker action betw. Bond & Le Chiffre.",negative
one of the best bond films ever!!!,positive
one of the best bond films ever!!!,positive
Debo confesar que me encanta Daniel Craig.... suma puntos a la peli,positive
The best of all the 007 movies ever and Daniel Craig is the sexiest James Bond so far. He plays his role perfectly then any other. He is what James Bond SHOULD be.,positive
James Bond is not good anymore. This was just stupid.,negative
DanielCraig is gorgeous!,positive
Not a fan of a Bond who can't order a Martini,negative
It was a great movie with a great plot but the ending sucked,positive
"Great action movie, Daniel is fab.",negative
"Say what you will, but Daniel Craig is the best Bond we've had in years. The opening alone is a stunner!",negative
Is this what Bond has become? Overblown and unbelievable action sequences combine with a dull script. The acting of Daniel Craig and Judi Dench is the only thing that raises this above one star. I was particularly disturbed by the way the film seemed to eroticise violence; torture and cruelty seem to be the new pornography.,negative
definitely one of the better bond movies.,negative
By far THE greatest James Bond movie of all time! . .,positive
"interesting new spin on Bond. i liked it, despite the stupid freerunning scene in the beginning.",positive
"he's not sean connery, haha but he'll do",positive
"I thought Daniel Craig was going to be horrible and try to act like Pierce Brosnin, but he doesnt, he creates a different type of bond which is definatly more interesting.",positive
Daniel Craig - Grrrrrrr!!,positive
"Gah, so much poker and so few cars!",negative
"There were so many things I loved about this movie. The concept of the title alone is crazy. To take the name of the 1967 spoof film and actually make it apart of the Bond family of films is nuts. The actual movie was a look into the rookie 00 agent's career and really did a good job reintroducing Bond to new generation audiences as well as the old fans. They pretty much gave the origin of everything all the way down to the famous drink (with the exception of Q). Action, suspense, drama, gadgets, guns, women,....perfect.",positive
best james bond ever,positive
I loved this movie. There was a lot of twists to the movie. I don't think that I would watch it again though. All of the fun is out of it. It was a good action movie.,positive
"Craig's Bond is the most believable one since Connery's. Eva Green is also quite good. Enjoyable because its all about Bond again, and not how big the explosions are.",positive
"for once, we finally get a bond movie which doesn't really heavily on gadgets and over the top CGI and solely focused on the plot and character. I can see how 007 got his start and kinda explains the myth and aura of 007",positive
loved this film never really been bothered bout bond but my god i am now,positive
"Finally, a new and original Bond film! I haft to say that the past few films were getting a little unrealistic and mediocre. Don't get me wrong, Pierce was great, the writting and over-kill of CGI were to blame....like a certain invisible car etc Casino Royal on the other hand was fantastic! Daniel Craig plays the new Bond with zest and style, with a much better revitalised and gritty script. The fact they didn't try to over complicate things with new gadgets, drawn-out fight scenes or excuses to simply blow stuff up for the sake of it was a nice change. Credit also has to go to the likes of sinister Giancario Giannini, the authoritive Judi Dench and the smoking hotness that is Eva Green for providing us with great acting and screen presence. I enjoyed this film after being hooked during the first five minutes...the action was neatly spaced between the suspense of the card game, the chases were just long enough not to be drawn out and the torture scene certainly gave a few guys, and even some of the girlies, a few winces and sharp breaths..... XD Can't wait for ""Quantum of Solice""",positive
"The first and only Bond movie I've seen as an adult and I was really surprised. I'd watch more of them, and will soon as long as Daniel Craig is in them.",positive
james bond looked so hot in this movie...i luved it,positive
It was a good action movie but it...didn't strike me as a Bond movie somehow...,positive
"Daniel Craig is so hot in this, Amazing",positive
"Bond re-invented. Best Bond movie in a VERY long time. Daniel Craig made me nervous, but he really owns the role. Can't wait till the next one!",positive
This effectively re-spawned my interest in the franchise!! I need to check out the other Bond's not including Brosnan as Ive seen those.,positive
":fresh: 3.5/4 A GREAT REMAKE OF THE CLASSIC BOND [url=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/casino_royale/""][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/movie/coverv/29/952329.jpg[/img][/url]",positive
"For the first time since the sixties, Bond stars in a spy film. To do this, he had to return to his pre-icon roots. You see, and icon is expected to behave differently than a man (indestructible and impervious to setting and opposed forces), and the Bond in Casino Royale is superficially harder, less sophisticated, and ultimately more human than the character that starred in the previous Bond roles (exceptions include Connery and Dalton). This Bond is a dangerous novice; he is vulnerable to betrayal, new at killing, and not quite completely sure of himself. Because of this characterization, Bond remains dynamic, and steals the show. That is not to say that this movie doesn't deliver. Between the beautiful women, the explosive action sequences that would leave Moore or Brosnan winded, and a car crash that made the Guinness Book of World Records, this is a movie that improves what was sufficient once by delivering what is needed for a new audience. And what is delivered is a story driven by character, not by archetype.",positive
Better than I expected,positive
"an amazing relaunch of bond, edgy, and bold, highly recommended",positive
"this is the ONLY bond movie i watch and liikee ... finally james bond is a normal person who can get hurt, fall in love ( with one woman !!!) and have fun. I totally enjoyed it sooo much ... even the action part ( leaving aside the first fight )",positive
Best Bond since Sean!!,negative
"Is this possibly one (if not the best) Bond ever, funny, witty, nice bond girls, nice cars, totally amazed by this movie, as a bond nut I was totally convinced after the first 5mins.",positive
"Meh, this won't let me give 4.5 stars... Anyway, the best since Goldeneye, just let down slightly by the off-beat pacing (essentially necessary for the new set-up) and fact there's no decent car chase!",positive
the only great about this movie were the special effects. i did not really understand the plot or the storyline; they didn't grab or hold my attention.,negative
why oh why is poker nu zo cool.. degoutant,negative
THE BEST BOND YET A GOOD PLOT LOOKING FOWARD TO THE NEXT ONE.,positive
A breath of fresh air to the Bond legacy with Craig reviving the suave cult icon. A little drawn out at times but overall an entertaining film.,negative
It's not Sean Connery.,positive
so good. does justice to bond!,positive
"for the first time in the james bond franchise, he looks, sounds, acts and uses in a very believable manner.",positive
"This movie made James Bond a bad ass, and I'm alright with that. It was funny to see Daniel Craig completely cop a feel on Eva Green in the CPR scene.",positive
This movie is one of my favorite movies it has great action sceens and i like the chases,positive
The guy was too old though.,positive
"absolutely loved this one! it gave great insight into the character and how he became WHO he was. daniel craig was said to be too blond and too short to play james bond, but he grabbed the role by the throat and ran away with it. i wasn't a bond fan until this movie, and craig was the perfect choice.",positive
awesome movie the begginning chase scene is very well done,positive
The man is hot... plain and simple...,positive
Chris Cornell - You know my name! Very good song!,negative
pas trop mal beaucoup d'action et puis on l'a vu en blu ray alors ca joue aussi :),negative
The best modern James Bond film to date!,negative
quite boring indeed.........,negative
"Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan are great, but I have to admit: Daniel Craig, in my opinion, plays the best Bond to date. The movie is pretty accurate in terms of following the book, while the movie itself is intense - it keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is definitely a masterpiece.",positive
Like the new Bond guy...but the movie could have used a few more hot chicks,positive
"AWESOME!!! I loved this movie,Daniel Craig is the best Bond so far.",positive
"Nothing beats the classic Bond of Connery and Moore. However, Craig and Casino Royale are good. I was getting annoyed at the end with Bond and Vesper being all in love and stuff, since that is NOT how James Bond rolls. Luckily, they reestablished my faith in Bond. They had me worried, though. Cheeky monkeys!",positive
Un peu tire un longueur a certains passages mais le passage du relais a D.Craig est reussi tout comme une plus grande noirceur dans le personnage,positive
"A very good action film, but not that great of a Bond film. Very entertaining though.",positive
"Very good Bond film, much more realistic and still captures the feeling of Bond.",positive
"Sorry, but no. It took me the entire film to even *halfway* buy DC as Bond and I still can't commit to the idea. The only thing that really made this ""Bond"" for me was the continuity of M. The movie, itself, was formulaic and I barely hung in there for the first half.",negative
"Was very good, i thought DC did a great job as Bond, it was still a bit strange not seeing Pierce as Bond or Dalton but he did a good job, some of the action was crazy like usual and the torture scene was really disgusting, good ending and Madam M was quite humorous in her talkin down to Bond:) I would recommend the movie to everyone and i think Daniel Craig(DC)can do it again:D",positive
Bloody Bond is back with the character more as a true assassin rather than a debonaire stud on the town.,negative
Clearly one of the best 007 movies of all time! The opening scenes of Casino Royale were amazing! A definite must-see action packed James Bond flick!,positive
people certainly were not lying when they said that daniel craig does a great job as the new bond. he holds up &gives you everything that you want bond to be. recent bonds have really begun to push the limits of what's real &what's fantasy but this one get's the series back on track.,positive
"Bad ass. As much as I love the previous Bond movies and as different as this one is, it's still pretty damn sweet. It's kind of Batman Begins in that way.",positive
(Craig) is the Ugliest Bond to this date.,negative
The Best Bond film ever. Daniel Craig does a perfect job in the movie. The action scenes are awesome and the score is great. Two thumbs way up,positive
great film...the only thing i didnt like was the torture...that made me wince haha. i'm looking forward to the sequel(s) as well.,positive
Worst Bond movie ever.,negative
"Daniel Craig is badass, but he's no Connery. Still badass though.",positive
"The opening credits were awesome, and the first acrobatic foot chase was fantastic. Other than those, hated it. Daniel Craig looks like a chimpanzee, he's not Bond to me (sorry tanya). And the script needed some serious cutting. I was bored, and kept having to turn down the swelling music.",negative
"The best movie in the series due to the realism, uh...well, realatively more realism than any other Bond. Bruises, blood, and general even-handed ass kicking on top of the somewhat plausible human stunts (vs. techno gadgets) and deeper characters all made for a more engaging movie. The only thing keeping this from getting all stars is the lack of chemistry with Vesper and the length of the movie.",positive
"Preferred the original, not as good as the other James Bonds",negative
My favourite of all the James Bond movies..,positive
The sexiest BOND ever!!! YES!!! GO BLONDIE!!!!,positive
Kinda long but it'll have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.,positive
This is the way Flemming ment Bond to be!,positive
"This was a really fun, action-packed movie that brought the Bond film franchise to my attention. It really went back to Fleming's source material, but it avoided two major pitfalls of doing that: A) it updated the plot for contemporary audiences, and B) it made Daniel Craig's Bond a lot more interesting and human character that one can sympathize with. Even as a general purist when it comes to novel adaptations, I have to say that Fleming's novel lacked a good deal of character development that Campbell's adaptation brought about, yet there was more than enough action in the film to definitely keep it Bond. Daniel Craig was completely amazing, and the physical stunts in the movie were absolutely crazy. Great movie, solid story, tight pacing, and I'm looking forward to Craig's return to Bond.",positive
Best bond movie and 1 of the best action movies.,positive
Pretty decent first outing for Daniel Craig as the new 007- brings a lot of realism in to Bond something that has been over lacking during the Peirce Brosmen series.. It was spoilt though in the first beach scene- wher they tried to make Bond hunkish in a beach noy kindda way lol,negative
"Daniel Craig is a good choice as Bond. Why all the violence against African men, though?",negative
"Not ""Classic"" Bond, a modern remake in the same vein. Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond; much closer to Fleming's character than the cinematic versions we're used to.",positive
"best bond ever, working class bond",positive
The James bond film everyone has been waiting for.great film,positive
Possibly the best Bond yet.,positive
"nobody does it better, than sean! still damn good show, mr. craig...look forward to taking your job in bond 24!",positive
i thought this movie did an excellent job of recreating the james bond series,positive
"being a huge pierce brosnan fan myself, i was reluctant to give daniel craig a chance. Once i watched it though, i give craig props that rival if not surpass brosnan's. the only thing i didn't like it that i don't think anyone really cares to see the emotional side of 007. his little love story is a lot like mine... but with mad action. never trust bitches... they will always fuck you.",positive
"Great re-boot, re-imagining of icon. Love the romance angle.",negative
I haven't been much of a Bond guy...maybe that's why I thought it was fine.,positive
"even though his gadgets consisted of vials of medicine and a defibrillator, the movie was pretty awesome.",positive
The name is Blonde....James Blonde. And he has REALLY itchy balls.,positive
"Pretty good movie. I liked the new Bond, the action and the story. I didn't like the lack of Bond girls, no Q and no new Bond gadgets.",negative
"as a bond film, 2 1/2, if it wasnt a bond film, easily 41/2",negative
the only bond movie i've ever liked. and i really liked it.,positive
"Casino Crappy. I can't believe people not only sat through this, but enjoyed it! I had to break it into three viewings to get through it! Craig was great, but the story was a stain on the Bond legacy. What a bore.",negative
"Saw it at the cinema. Funny at times but kept it very serious. People have said the book is better, i still found this entertaining. Am looking forward to the sequal.",positive
"An excellent re-boot of what was a classic but aging franchise. The more subtle, realistic script revitalises Bond, as does Daniel Craig's performance as the famous secret agent. This is how action/thrillers are done.",positive
i saw it like a millon times.. love it,positive
"Enjoyable action film from Bond of the 21st century. Daniel Craig shows a deeper side to probably the most famous movie character in history. There is not the level of tongue in cheek action as previous Bond's have displayed, but there are some ridiculous poker hands. The story is darker and more serious than most 007 movies but this makes for an exciting watch.",negative
"Un trÃ¨zs bon James bond, vive aston martin",positive
"A decent movie, but successfully kills everything that Bond is.",negative
"This was a great action movie. I have never really got into any bond movies before. I had seen bits of different movies but they never really caught my attention and seemed a bit dated (even ones with Brosnan). There was a lot of buzz about this re-invention of Bond and it is such a defining character in movie history I thought I would rent it. I had also been watching the Bourne trilogy and was interested in how they would compare. I'm glad I did, first of all this is completely different in style and story to Bourne so I will stop comparing them. It had all the classic Bond stereotypes - guns, girls, gadgets and a baddie with a scar. I think the bad guy was a bit of a let down, he kept using an asthma inhaler but that was never used against him so it made him look a bit weak, although he was good in the torture scene. Another bad point was that it kept flicking on to new scenes that would only last a couple of minutes and seemed like a pointless distraction. Every time you thought the credits were about to roll up it started with a different ending. I think I would have preferred it to end in before Venice. I don't think I would bother watching the new one out this year but I'm glad I saw this. My wife found it a bit dull but that's girls for you ;-)",negative
Nunca pasa de moda el 007,negative
This movie is rad. I want to be James Bond.,positive

I was very disappointed by this. Daniel is the new improved bond but story line was redundant. You expect more from Bond,negative
"i really really like it, Bond is a real action hero, love it",positive
I'm glad they remade from the originals even though Sean Connery was pretty funny,negative
"So fucking good, it justs gets better and better every time I see it, Daniel Craig I salute you sir :D",positive
Is it the best Bond film ever?,positive
"Hell yes, what a beginning middle and end. What a cliffhanger. The special effects were nice, the girls were nice, and the plot was badass",positive
Wow!! Daniel Craig does Bond justice. One of my new all time favorite Bond movies!,positive
"Here's the deal. I love Daniel Craig as 007. I like the edge that he brings to the role. I haven't enjoyed a Bond movie since Connery. I love that we see how he gets jaded - that he didn't start out that way. The chase scene at the beginning of the movie is fantastic. LOVED it! This is an adult movie - not meaning that it's bad, but that it was written for adults. Loved it! Judi Dench is fantastic as always as the infallible M.",positive
The first Bond movie I've ever seen---GREAT,negative
But I am a Bond fan...,positive
"not so good for a bond movie, maybe i just don't like daniel craig that much. =)",negative
"Took me long enough to finally see it. Not bad, but not my favourite Bond movie.",positive
begrudgingly watched it for the sake of friendship ... 3 hrs I've never get back,negative
Daniel Craig makes an awesome James Bond. This film has plenty of action and really stands out on its own.,negative
"I am not a huge ""007 man,"" but I have seen a fare share of Bond movies and I have to say Martin Campbell's Casino Royale is by far my favorite. When I say that to most people I get looked at as if I said Batman Forever was my favorite Batman movie (it's not!). Once the viewer can leave their expectations behind, they can really enjoy and appreciate the visually amazing opening credits, the wonderfully choreographed & edited actions scenes, the breathtaking cinematography, and the charismatic Daniel Craig. I really love this film. The upcoming Bond film, Quantum of Solace, is not going to be directed by Martin Campbell but I expect good things from the returning Bond, Daniel Craig, and new Bond director Marc Forster, director of Stranger Than Fiction.",positive
Great way to start another Bond saga,negative
This movie seemed incredibly LONG.,negative
mega good actiony stuff but its weird wen dat woman dies at da end...,positive
Daniel Craig brings the badass back to Bond that has been sorely lacking in recent Bond films.,positive
"People who are used to and love the ""new school"" James Bond may not love this. There is no fancy and exotic gadgets, there is no crazy sci-fi elements... none. James Bond is back to his root of being a Spy who is ""Licensed to Kill"" with no (maybe few) gadgets - and that's exactly why I love this film. To be honest, I love James Bond back when he has much less gadgets (i.e. the Sean Connery era), just like in Ian Fleming's novels. That's what a true James Bond should be. And this film, kinda like what Batman Begins did, completely changed the tone of the entire series and work well as a reboot. This 007 film is much more darker and grittier than the Pierce Brosnan's era 007 - they just feel a bit too cartoon-ish to me. While most people criticized Daniel Craig for his looks (""He looks like a freaking monkey!!"" ""He is blonde!!"" ""He is blue eyes!!""... btw Roger Moore does not has black hair too - but he was also a great 007) - he is one of the best James Bond ever. Maybe not as good as Connery (personally I think Craig's Bond is much more realistic than Connery's), but definitely one of the best. His acting is much better than what I expect. The only thing I have to complain about is the ending - I HATE cliffhangers in movies. Just hope that he would be in more Bond films though... and btw, the part where Bond's testicles repeatedly getting bashed is probably the funniest part of the film... lol (rather than using a lash, they should use a carpet beater that is used in the original Casino Royale novel... lol)",positive
a good cut off at the end. oh and pretty awesome!!,positive
"Great Bond film, Craig surpasses everyone but Sean as Bond.",positive
I have trouble thinking of this as a Bond movie because it's so different from all the others. Still very good though somewhat uneven in places and could be half an hour shorter.,positive
"This movie owns so much, that I cant even put it into words. I have not seen every james bond movie, but I will go ahead and say its the best one, craig is the best bond and eva green is the best bond girl.",positive
that`s better the dark side of bond he da man,positive
Best Bond movie ever. Period. Nuff said. End of story.,positive
"Daneil Craig... IS James bond! Sorry Sean you have lost the title, well only just.",positive
"One of the best 007 movies in a long time--it doesn't rely on a whole bunch of special effects like the last few movies have, and instead relies more on a solid story and good action throughout. It got a little slow near the end, but overall a great movie.",positive
"James Bond as he was always meant to be: dark, cynical, trapped in a world where no one can be trusted.",positive
"Been A fan since I was kid and growing up in the Dalton Era wasn't great and Brosnan brought new love to the series but when I saw Casino Royale for the first time I couldn't even speak.....even after the movie, I've never been so mesmorized with a movie like I was watching Casino Royale. Loved every minute and who couldn't love the ending AMAZING!",positive
"blockbuster rented: sucks... where is the spying, where is the action? i miss the old bond",negative
Bond re-vamp and action movie re-vamp for post 911 and how action movies should be made.,positive
IT WAS AMAZING AND WONDERFUL AND THE FIGHTING SCENES WERE AMAZINGLY GREAT ALL TOGETHER I LOVED IT AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS GREAT,positive
A HUGE relief from the relative lack of good Bond movies.,positive
"I've yet to see a Bond film I like for more than fifteen minutes. This one has the most gripping fifteen since The Living Daylights, and Craig does well in the little the role demands, but you can't help thinking he's wasting his talents on moody-looking routine thrillers like this.",negative
Really great! I wast expecting to enjoy it but I did.,positive
"Daniel Craig beats Connery, Brosnan, and the others as the best Bond.",positive
"less actions, n more dramatic performances. something new for this kind of movie. don't know why, i just fall in love with Craig. haha :p Ms. Green is soo beautiful. overall, i enjoyed it so much.",negative
"Casino Royale is the best thing that's happened to James Bond in years. Despite having the coolest gadgets, cars and women, Bond has become out-to-date and even cheesy. There's no way James Bond can match today's superspies like Jason Bourne. So what to do? Do like what Marvel did with its Ultimates comics... Reboot and start anew. Take us back to the beginning and show us a new James Bond. And that exactly is the strength of this movie. You may have doubts as to whether Daniel Craig is the right choice to play James Bond, but as the movie progresses it becomes clear that he's the right man for the job. Inexperienced, brash and relatively new to being a 007. He takes a beating and gives out some too, unlike the previous Bond movies where James Bond can survive all sorts of attacks with his dinner jacket is still intact. Although this movie spends a lot of time at the gambling table, the hard hitting action scenes stands out. Add in a nice theme song by Chris Connell and you got a great spy movie. James Bond is back, guys and girls.",positive
"Ah, Daniel. Parasta on kuitenkin kateva kannettava defibrillaattori...",positive
"I wellcome reboot of Bond frnachise, with new more appropriate style and a new, more modern Bond.",positive
"Enfin un 007 realiste. J'ai toujours cru qu'il devrait etre un peu psychopathe ou detache emotionellement pour bien faire son travail qui consiste a tuer les cibles, utiliser les femmes pour obtenir de l'info et d'autres activites qui necessitent de faire taire sa conscience. Ce qui fait de lui un bon agent ne sont pas des qualites que l'on veut retrouver chez nos frequentations",positive
"It has it's flaws, but is certainly better than the Pierce Brosnan output. A far throw from Connery & Moore though. Only time will tell whether Daniel Craig's a good Bond or not...",negative
"I just saw it it was awesome good action and you get to really understand Mr bonds personalty and past. Ending was cool but sad, but like i said it explains allot about his lifestyle.",positive
Bond is back!! :)) This time with great action :) My fav Bond is Daniel Craig and it is a great action movie,positive
A total reboot and the best Bond of the series.,positive
Worst Bond movie ever.,negative
This is the only movie I've ever walked out on. I am a big James Bond fan and this was Bond in name only. Both my husband and myself hated this movie.,negative
"This was probably the best Bond film I've seen. Absolutely loved it. A completely different, more realistic style than all the previous films in the series... but once again, DAMN GOOD. Connery has competition atop the list of best 007's.",positive
"que hombre mas guapo, fuerte, etc.. haaaa accion...",positive
"Wasn't into it the first time I saw it, but enjoyed it the second.",negative
great! daniel craig is da bomb!,positive
"I remember being disappointed when I heard Daniel Craig would be the new Bond. I couldn't have been more wrong. This Bond is typically smooth, but refreshingly gritty. I also really like the more fully developed love story and the strong female lead. A very welcome change for this female Bond fan! But don't be fooled by talk of love, this Bond is as action-packed and entirely entertaining from start to fantastic finish.",positive
very nice looking Bond!,negative
Je suis un fan de James Bond,positive
"definitely the best opening action scene in a movie, ever. pretty well done, the end was a little stupid in my opinion but the rest of it was really good.",positive
c bien mais pas pas plus que ca,negative
"For a Bond movie, it's pretty damn good! Surprising script quality, vivid and entangling action scenes, wonderful movie all together.",positive
daniel craig plays a pretty good james bond!,positive
"Good story, but not Bond. They get credit for portraying a panic attack well.",negative
"The best of the lot. So far, anyway...",positive
Daniel Craig performance of Bond is very good and i especially like the love scenes with Eva Green (Lucky woman). Oh and Daniel Craig in the water and Tuxedo = SEXY!,positive
Watched it for the third time. Can see a whole lot more dialog and plot now - gettong better with age.,positive
"Brilliant Bond movie. Daniel Craig plays a very good Bond, in my opinion, better than Pierce Brosnan. Unlike relying on his gadgets like Brosnan does, Daniel Craig adds more fist fighting and action to the Bond franchise and makes it more exciting. This movie also does well to add more humour. Overall a nice revamp of the series.",positive
"not a fan of 007, but this one was pretty good",negative
"After watching this movie for the tenth time, I've concluded that it's my new favorite Bond movie. Incidentally, my favorite Bond movie before this one was directed by the same guy, so it's all good. Bigger action, believable characters (at least compared to other Bond flicks), and yet it still manages to keep that Bond flair/badassery. Daniel Craig is James Bond. So is Sean and Pierce (sometimes Roger), but Daniel is perfect. The name's Bond... James Bond. Alknfaoeifnapweof. <3",positive
"Best James Bond ever. Daniel craig owns!! The poker scenes did get a bit boreing, but everything eles was fantastic I'm excited for Quantum of Solice.",positive
Daniel Craig brings Bond back to the Connery era. Brilliant!,positive
"Daniel Craig plays Bond very well in this film, looking forward to quantum of solice",positive
"Very Good, best Bond since 1st one",positive
"so lame, give me old school baby any day",negative
"His name is Bond...James Bond. For over 40 years, he has used his License to Thrill. He returns with a new man as the timeless character. Daniel Craig brings new feeling to Bond. For 45 years it's been an annoying formula. Shaken, not stirred: Bond gets mission, Bond meets girl, Bond sleeps with girl, Bond meets villain, Bond fights villain, Bond wins fight, Bond sleeps with girl again. This formula has been used in the last 18 films before Casino Royale. Craig makes you believe he is a human and not a super hero. He leaves us shaken AND stirred. And he falls in love with Vesper Lynd (Eva Green). This is great change for the series.",positive
loved it hes the man and the gash where hot,positive
1 Of The Best James Bond Films They Have Made.,positive
I love the direction that this latest Bond film franchise has taken. It is more a suspense spy caper film then a superhero with high tech gadgets film. There is a toughness and vulnerability to this new 007 that seems to work well. One of the better James Bond films to date.,negative
Daniel Craig makes one helluva James Bond! Amazing plotline and fantastic effects!,positive
Daniel Craig is the bond.,positive
"Ok, it wasn't the last ""new"" movies I saw, but it looked mighty fine in HD last weekend. So it counts.",positive
"Fleming's Bond is back after an era of exagerated villains and nonstop gadgets. Not that Craig doesn't have the suave personality that charcterised his 007 predecessors. He certainly does. The producers and writers have opted for a more realistic plot to drive the James Bond character (as realistic as a Bond adventure can get of course) along with a cinematic portrayal of 007 himself that is ripped right off the pages of the original novels. Craig, Eva Green and the supporting cast are all top notch and the stunt work is done the way it should be in a Bond film: real people, real stunts. Here's to a rejuvenated 007 franchise!",positive
De l'action sans arret.,negative
"PelÃ­cula liviana, pero mejor que las anteriores. Echo de menos el sentido de la ironÃ­a de Roger Moore. Este Craig se parece mas a los duros que dominan hoy.",negative
Une jolie tentative de raffraichir la chose. Moi j'adhère.,negative
"Non sarÃ  Sean Connery, ma proprio per questo ci piace...",positive
Borrrrriiiiiiinnnnnnng. *Yawns*.,negative
Really refreshing after the last few Bonds. Daniel Craig proved all of the sceptics wrong - he definitely nailed his role,positive
"It felt more like Mission Impossible than a James Bond movie in several parts. It wasn't too bad, though. I'd definitely watch it again ;)",negative
i love this film and daniel craig !!!,positive
"one of the baest Bond movies i 've ever seen, great plot and soo much action!",positive
"Good acting and Daniel Craig is probaly the cooles Bond since Sean Connery. Eva Green is very very good also. The action sequences are a bit too superheroic though even for a Bond, his almost unlimited powers - jumps around like he was some kind of acrobatic superhero baboon and he runs as like a superhero above every normsl human capacity also - make those parts a bit overworked at times. But overall one of the best Bond movies.",negative
Nail biter.. Loved it!,positive
""" The best James Bond film, since Dr. No """,positive
"Gritty and enticing, this reboot breathes new life into the Bond franchise with a young and inexperienced Bond who seems to get into trouble more often than not.",positive
"Daniel Craig is definitely a better 007 than Pierce Brosnan. Overall a pretty good movie with some pretty impressive action scenes, but a little too much poker.",positive
The best Bond film yet. Daniel Craig completely reinvents the character in a way that is both unique and refreshing.,positive
"Not as funny as the original. What? I'm not the first person to make that joke? Damn you internet! You take a perfectly good one-liner that works great on a small group of ill-informed friends, and turn it into yesterday's mass-media ho-hum. *sulk*",positive
"If you have not seen a Bond movie before, make this one your first one! Daniel Craig brings Bond into the 21st Century with a lot more edge and appeal! His interpretation of the ""cultural icon"" seats him at the same table as Sean Connery, they both make the character very appealing!",positive
Over-rated! Clap clap clap clap clap!,negative
"reinvented the bond franchise, a bond film i actually enjoyed.",positive
Good but when will it end? when will it end?,negative
Best Bond movie created!,positive
"I am so into Daniel Craig as James Bond. I went into this movie expecting to leave amused, bewildered, and tired (like I usually do with Bond movies) and wound up amazed and moved. A real turned corner in this series of films.",positive
Daniel Craig removed all doubt that he may not have been anything but perfect for this role. Bond is back one of the best since Goldeneye!,positive
Excellent!! Daniel Craig re-defined the role of 007. This is one of the best Bond movies ever made and Craig gives Lazenby and Connery a run for their money. I am a proud Bond fan once more!,positive
"the best james bond movie ever, in my opinion",positive
Way awesome action movie.,positive
"Bond, man. It's Bond.",positive
"This was the best Jimbo I've ever seen... I have it on my PDA, so I can watch it on the go. Waiting for the next Jimbo on cinema.",positive
"I hated this the first time I watched it. In fact I recall using lines like ""Its not bond, its not right"" but after watching it again I feel its taking a step in the right direction. Craig is suprisingly convincing and theyve cut out the dire dialog from the last couple. Looking forward to the next one.",positive
"This was probably the best Bond movie I've seen, and I'm a huge Connery fan. It was the leasy corny/campish, and definitely the edgiest. Daniel Craig gave this legendary character the toughness and rawness that it needed. There are always going to be holes in a Bond story, but there were the least amount in Casino Royale. Well done!",negative
"1) I have never seen any other James Bond film, so (un?)fortunately, I am unable to judge Daniel Craig against previous Bonds. I am also unable to compare this film to previous films for how well the character was portrayed, and since I didn't grow up with this mythology surrounding James Bond, I don't feel any strong connections to the character which would lead me to grant this movie leniency. 2) I watched this movie with RiffTrax, which can sometimes be disastrous when watching a movie that you've never seen before because it shows you all of the films flaws and weaknesses. Those admissions out of the way, <i>Casino Royale</i> is about half great. Knowing what little I do about James Bond, I know that his movies have to have action in them. This movie indeed has action -- and some pretty impressive action at that. The filmmakers were obviously trying to make this movie kind of realistic (James Bond bleeds!) and usually that comes through... although he does tend to be able to leap off of buildings and land without injury. There is an extended portion of the movie that involves a high-stakes poker game. I don't know anything about poker. Maybe if I did, I would have found that more interesting. Of course, then again, maybe the movie could have made it more interesting for me. Close-ups on eyes does not a thriller make. Still, a lot of the movie is pretty enjoyable, even if the movie feels like it's ending two or three times before it actually does. And I don't really understand what happened at the end, but I'm willing to accept that it's a lead-in to yet another sequel and not question it too much. All in all: it's pretty okay.",negative
"I thought Sean Connery was the best Bond ever, until Daniel Craig put on the tux. He's given Bond an edge of nastiness...",positive
Very near the origine of Bond Stories. Realistic !,positive
You have a great Job!!,positive
"The most realistic Bond movie ever. I'm a big fan of the Bond flicks and I've grown accustomed to the campish style, but I liked this a whole lot more. It still had the Bond style, but it was grittier and more down to Earth. Bond was also more of a flawed, human character and wasn't always in control. I'm not usually a fan of revamps, but this one works. A fresh, modern take on an old concept. Just what the franchise needed.",positive
Good movie. Liked Daniel Craig's premiere as Bond. Just thought it dragged on for way too long at the end.,negative
"it was ok, Sean Connery is still James Bond",negative
"A new direction in the Bond series, Daniel Craig makes 007 more classy, suave and most of all a perfect gentleman. Craig is the Bond that Fleming envisioned.",positive
The best Bond movie post Sean Connery.,positive
Daniel Craig is hot!,positive
no 1.. bond is brilliant.,positive
probably my favorite Bond flick,negative
Nice addition to the Bond series,positive
"Surprisingly entertaining and really good action. Some might not agree with me *stares viciously at Adam*, but I think this was a great Bond movie.",negative
The best Bond movie. Ever.,positive
"Daniel Craig is honestly the best Bond since Sean Connery. He makes the film just perfect, and plays Bond with just the right amount of style. I think the best part is that there are no fancy gadgets- the most high tech instrument is a defibrillator. Pure action, and the poker scenes make good breaks.",positive
it a classy film if u not seen it see it,positive
An interesting take on the Bond character. A bit more gritty and realistic than recent Bond flicks. Also a bit dragggy in places...,negative
Definitely worth watching,negative
"An excellent Bond movie.But not worthy of the saga of course...Yet it brings the human side of Bond,eliminating the whole-gadget wilderness",negative
my name is bond james bond,positive
Easily the best bond yet. Bring on Bond 22,positive
Film James Bond paling keren yang gue tonton...,positive
I still think it's a bit cheap but it's beginning to grow on me so I'm actually starting to like it. After 5 views. Which is a lot. Looks stunning in HD.,negative
What a lovely man to watch!! lol great story line nice view loved it cheep and cheerful just like me!!!!,positive
I hate to say it but this is the best james bond movie ever. Even if I miss the gadets.,positive
"I've got to say this is THE best Bond movie in history. Daniel Craig is Bond. He has everything the previous Bonds never had. The soundtrack is gripping, the actors are awesome, and the locations where they shot the film is absolutely stunning and beautiful. I love the car crash scene. I highly recommend this movie to everybody. This is one of the movies you have to watch at least once. I can't wait till the new James Bond movie comes out! I'm extremely excited about Quantum of Solace. Marc Forester is an excellent director and is one of my favorites, and I'm sure he'll do a great job with it, just like he did with Finding Neverland, The Kite Runner, and Stranger than Fiction!",positive
"I really did, surprisingly, enjoy this movie. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery, I am certain about that. He also has burning blue eyes and a pretty good torso (oh, sorry to be so sexist, can't help it). It also had a different ""feel"" about it compared to its vapid, gimmicky recent predecessors. Even the fight scenes and chases were more interesting and real. Really very good - moody and edgy, Bond sweats and bleeds quite a bit and shows vulnerability. Well, he is early Bond. I'm looking forward to the next one (the title of which sounds like a Radiohead song)...",positive
By far the most entertaining Bond movie ever.,positive
"Gosh... you'd think long drawn-out scenes of people playing poker would have made the ""deleted scenes"" list, but no, they just add to this disappointing flick.",negative
A grittier bond film and pretty good I thought,negative
"Another one I fell asleep through....in a movie theatre, that's what happens when 3 guys get to pick the movie and 1 girl isn't going to change their mind...",negative
"Finally, the franchise wised up and returned to the series' roots, when Connery's Bond was a rough-and-tumble thug-in-a-tux. Gadgets have been scaled back considerably and the heroine given a brain, and the casting of Craig brings gravitas and acting skill to the role. There are still ""oh come on"" moments that stretch the limits of taste and credibility, and the card scene in the movie's midsection could have lost 10 minutes, but this was a welcome reboot to a legacy that had grown tired and irrelevant.",positive
"A very good film, just not sure if it's a very good Bond film.",negative
"A great revival to the 46 year old franchise finds a new actor making Bond completely his own and the film actually acts as a small character study of Bond. The old school Bond is born again, but Daniel Craig is probably an even more mature behaving Bond than Connery. With an intriguing and well written screenplay from beginning to end.",positive
great actions scenes but really really lllooonnnnggggg.,negative
"A good action flick, but it doesn't seem super Bond-like.",positive
"You have to be impressed with Daniel Craig as James Bond. The story is very well developed, and I love the suspense here.",positive
"This movie is awesome, it is a great return to the bond style without all the silly gimmicks that they had turned into.",positive
One of the best Bond films ever.,positive
"Daniel Craig is a great Bond; about time they got it right. This movie restarts the whole story, and fortunately removes many of the problems with the old bond movies (Reasons why it was so easy to make all the Austin Powers movies). It now feels more like a suave Jason Bourne, which is good and bad. Casino Royale starts off amazing. Great action that is impressive. Then the movie goes into some sort of limbo where the story seems unrefined and the action timid. It could have used more gadgets and action but overall it's a good start and I'm looking forward to the other Bond films they make.",positive
"Just watched this for the second time, and for me, this is the best Bond movie ever made. And I used to be a die-hard Sean Connery purist! Daniel Craig puts more emphasis on Bond's ruthlessness, and less on his debonair ways. The stunts are incredible to watch and Craig is pure eye-candy. Can't wait for the next one.",positive
"Bond is back and better than ever! Craig is the perfect Bond for the 21st Century, he adds a realistic human quality to the character.",positive
"Much much better than 'Die Another Day', anything would have been really, but Craig is really good (needs to find a funny side though).",positive
james bond flicks rock - this is a great debut for a new bond character,positive
"I didn't want to like it- but I'm shocked, it actually worked! I was intensely sceptical about Craig as Bond, and the mere notion of a Bond movie where he bleeds, and sweats and gets his clothes in a mess is outrageous. And yet it works! I'm not sure it is really a Bond-movie, at least not in the traditional sense (cuz that requires cheeze), but it certainly is a spy movie and a good one at that. In fact, best one I've seen for quite a while...Totally surprised!",negative
Awesome! Awesome! Fucking Awesome! This 007 film is worth seeing even if you have an issue with a blonde bond or the modernizing of the film. Get over it. The series has officially restarted and it's going to be amazing!,positive
My favorite bond by far. Daniel Craig is close if not the best of the Bonds.Storyline was good too.Can't wait to see Quantum of Solace.,positive
Long live the Bond series!,positive
Not the typical James Bond but I liked it. Daniel Craig is up there with Sean Connery in likability for me and I appreciate the different Bond that we see here. I wish for more gadgets though...,negative
I was the only person to know Montenegro was a country. It was okay.,negative
"This beats the days of invisible cars and cheesy one liners. Great performance by Daniel Craig, surprising the doubters. Completely re-invents the James Bond Franchise. Bring on The Quantum of Solace.",positive
best 007 movie period,positive
"Daniel Craig is some serious competition for Sean Connery's ""best James Bond actor"" title.",positive
Perfect movie for a rainy day or anyother time really!,positive
"About time Bond got real. The 007 franchise had worn so thin that 'Bourne' was the new Bond. This film delivers on every level, from the opening 'hits' in moody, black & white footage through to the roller coaster action scenes that give the film pace. Craig is very, very believable in the role, with a controlled violence underpinning his portrayal. Chris Cornell's title track is one of the best Bond themes ever. All in all, a great revamp for the next decade.",positive
never liked bond til now!,positive
"Con el perdon de ""Goldfinger"", esta es la mejor pelicula sobre el agente 007 que se ha hecho hasta la fecha. Daniel Craig encarna a la perfeccion la rudeza y la sofisticacion de los libros de Ian Fleming como si las versiones de Connery, Lazenby, Moore, Dalton y Brosnan jamas hubieran existido. Esta maravillosa pelicula hizo lo mismo que ""Batman Begins"": un espectacular y muy bien pensado volver a empezar. Llamela ""James Bond Deconstructed"".",positive
daniel is good in the movie..he really surprised me as i was among the critics who thought daniel craig doesnt fit in the bond role and thought jason statham was the ideal person for the bond role...the film being the 2nd book of author really sucks...no stuff at all....but daniel really steals the show..ahh his gait was awesome,negative
"Very very good, just a bit too long",positive
"The first Bond movie I've liked the later years, especially the 90's movies was boring.",positive
"This is not part of the Bond franchise. This is instead the start of a darker and more faithful portrayal of the orginial books. This is not a bad thing for the movie; after unbelivable-even-for-Bond last outing in Die Another Day, the franchise was not only in danger of being totally discredited, but also a heartbeat away from the final nail in the coffin. A great start for Daniel Craig as Bond, portraying the character (set before all the other films) effectively as the sometimes naive but incredibly innovative agent. The story itself is intriguing for the first 75% of the film, but does get a little lost in itself afterwards. Special praise for the action set-pieces. There is definitely new life in these now, especially a cat and mouse chase through a construction site at the beginning of the film. Again, not an outright classic, but a great cast and some very tense scenes saves the movie, and shows much optimism for the next outing of the Martini-swigging Secret Agent.",negative
i really really liked this. finally a bond with some grit. daniel craig made pierce brosnan look like a nancy.,positive
Such a kick ass movie. I only started watching James Bond movies with this one and im glad it was this. If you want an AMAZING action movie this is the one.,positive
"Was good overall, but I still dont like the idea that Daniel Craig is a blonde... James Bond is supposed to have Jet Black hair... I also find it funny how this is a prequil to all Bond movies, but uses modern technology and cars.",negative
i dribbled all the way through this film!,positive
"very intense, but really well done.",positive
"I haven't seen any of the other Bonds, but I would have to say that Daniel Craig was pretty awesome! An unbelievable chase scene at the beginning and a dramatic denouement to finish. Seeing it again a few years later, just made it even better. And Bond's girl was alluring as usually. Definitely recommend to both Bond and non-Bond lovers.",positive
"Faktisk en veldig bra Bond-film! Mye usannsynlig, men slik skal vel James Bond vÃ¦re. :)",positive
"Starting what Timothy Dalton started, taking the character back closer to the orignal novels.",positive
I Love the New Bond.. and the idea of telling his story from the beginning. absolutely brilliant,positive
Best Bond movie EVER!!,positive
Best bond by a long way!!,positive
"This is in the upper eschelon of Bond movies, though it did not ""feel like a Bond movie, and that loses it major points. Other gripes: Daniel Craig mumbles, not enough gadgets, Judi Dench as M in an origin story, ladies not terribly sexy, and the cold feeling I got from the ending. But it was really good.",positive
Best bond movie ever.,positive
"A vulnerable bond, a man who falls in love, who is tricked, the second best bond film.",positive
"daniel craig is a way better james bond then the other guy, great movie even though i dont understand poker",positive
Touching paper during a staring contest is not a sport. Fuck poker.,negative
"Great Bond, albeit a bit Bourne. Rubbish villain.",negative
"it was pretty good...i had my doubts about a blonde bond, but it was undue worry",positive

"To my surprise, this is pretty good. Much better than the previous Bond films. More heart, more realistic actions scenes where Bond is actually a person with blood and tears. Best part, female counter parts with the same wit and weight, not just some poster girl.",negative
Bored me and i didn't know what the fuss was about. Why did he save the girl and break the CAR!,negative
this NEW Bond is the Best,positive
Real 2000 James Bonds,positive
he is d perfect bond & no doubt out of d all bond series dis 1 is d best.,positive
"A great addition to bond that surpassed all my expectations for the movie. However, the twists were not well enough engineered, could have been a little more traditional bond",positive
I really never thought that I'd see James Bond get whacked in the nuts by something that looks like a penis.,positive
"One of the best last 007. Craig fits in the character, although this is allegedly a ""new agent just promoted 007 and named James Bond"". The opening sequence with the chasing on the buildings' skeletons it's breathless. But globally the movie is not just a luna park of special effects.... it's rather a old-style spy stories benefiting of CGI without being a mere slave of it. THE SEQUENCE OF THE POKER IN MONTENEGRO IS AMAZING. Super final in Venice! A must for the passionates.",positive
"Craig does a great job, but I'd prefer older Bond movies.",negative
007 will always be a classic. I didnt think this James bond would suit the movie until the beach scene... when suddenly you realised why he was perfect for the job. I mean he was voted to have the best beach bod of the year for this film.,positive
"Bond, James Bond is back, and dude, he is grittier and cockier than ever! a fantastic re-imagining of 007 is just what the doctor ordered! Daniel Craig proved to me that he not only makes a great Bond, but also, he IS Bond! the action is fantastic, the script is well-written, the story....a bit confusing, to be honest....but the movie altogether, is a great Bond flick! I cannot wait for the (oh man i hate this title) The Quantum of Solace.....ehhhh......",positive
"I was pleasantly surprised by this most recent Bond endeavor. I didn't have great hopes for it. While it was probably about 20 minutes too long, it had a lot going for it and I was very impressed by Daniel Craig's take on Bond.",positive
"Could not have loved it more. The poker scenes could be trimmed, but the rest is PERFECT!",positive
All I have to say is everybody knows you scratched...,positive
Daniel Craig brought back the james bond i know and love,negative
"I cant believe it took me this long to see this,I was blown away by this movie,The opening 15 mins was one of the best I have ever seen.It kept me at the edge of my seat.I never really liked Bond movies.But this was a great action movie,About half way through it didnt even feel like a Bond movie.It kept you in it the whole time.I didnt even realize how long it was.If you got some time to kill this is a movie for you.It was very well done and the action was amazing.After watching this now I have to see the new one.And Daniel Craig plays 007 pretty darn well I must say.",positive
"I've been a Bond fan all my life, since I've been a little boy and have always been a fan of the franchise... Goldfinger, Live And Let Die and even OHMSS were classics for me as kid... but when I saw Timothy Dalton play Bond, I could not picture anyone else coming close to what Fleming described... Don't get me wrong, Connery is amazing, but Dalton was dark and Brosnan came close especially in Goldeneye.... then along comes Craig.... Ok.... The script has some ridiculous lines in it, especially the ""Take That lyrics"" recited at the end between Craig and the gorgeous Eva Green. And not to mention the hideous product placement... "" Is that a Rolex?.... No, Omega!"". Add to that the Dell laptop (or was it Sony?), the Ford Mondeo, and Richard Branson. But all in all, its the closest a Bond film has been to Flemings visions in years and this coming from a guy who's two favourites are Licence To Kill and Goldeneye (both non Fleming). The set pieces are incredible, and the story is actually believable unlike Moonraker and Die Another Day. Plus, if Solange wants to jump on me in that silk dress, she can anytime... followed swiftly by Eva Green. hehe.",positive
Graig off to a great start thanks to a good script and the recent trend of darker worlds for our heroes. Good to see Italy and France well represented in this long overdue serious addition to the classic franchise.,positive
"Not the bestest movie ever, but Daniel Craig won me over. And the opening sequence? Awesome. I could watch it over and over and over.",positive
the best Bond movie to date. I loved the brutality and honesty - not to mention that gorgeous bod!!! I never thought that I'd admit that he's even better than Pierce...,positive
"I'm not a huge fan of the Bond films. I never really enjoyed the old ones all that much, even the movies with Sean Connery. And the newer episodes of Bond's missions with Pierce Brosnon as Bond were even worse. But after hearing so many good things about Casino Royale and how Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery or better, I just had to go see it. At the time I was sixteen and had to beg my mother to let me go, as she wasn't too fond of Bond films. But she let me go. Two and a half hours later, and Casino Royale was the best Bond movie I'd seen. It's going on two years since I'd seen it in the theaters, along with watching the DVD a couple times, but I saw it at the library and I remembered what great fun this movie was and just had to pick it up. And I was reminded of just what an excellent movie it is. I think that really separates Casino Royale from its predecessors is that it manages to slip away from many of the cliches and instead attempts to make Bond a real government agent instead of some gadget centered superhero like Batman. There are practically none of the old gadget gimmicks that used to be a near central part of the movies. Instead, Bond is forced to rely on physical strength, his training, and his ability to think through the situation and make split-second decisions. This also results in us being more impressed by him than had he performed more of his tasks with some special tool that takes care of the problem immediately. And the one doing all this is Daniel Craig. It's true. He really is the best Bond ever. Firstly, he LOOKS the part better than anyone that has filled those shoes before. I'm not gay, but when I saw Craig in the famous Bond tux I couldn't help but saying, ""Oh yeah."" Put a silenced pistol in his hand and you've got the best looking Double O agent in the history of MI6. But he's more than just eye candy (again, NOT gay here...that's for the ladies). Craig does an amazing job of becoming his character. And it's not just about the use of his voice and accents, either, which is purely excellent. It's the way he holds himself up; the way he walks; the way he runs; the way he moves in a gun battle. It all adds up to exactly what my mental picture is of what he should be. Craig IS Bond. The rest of the acting is top-notch, nearly on par with Craig's performance. Probably the best cast of a Bond movie. Eva Green shows much more depth than is typical for a Bond girl, which is helped by the script writers almost completely removing the Bond girl cliche. Mads Mikkelson is rather creepy as the villain, another character who has more complexity that would normally be associated with his role. And the same can be said for just about everyone that appears on screen. There are some stereotypical moments and characters, but these are never enough to bog down the more realistic feel. Of course, Casino Royale wouldn't be a Bond film without action. This is another aspect that has Casino Royale reaching far past its predecessors. The masterfully choreographed and filmed Parkour scene will take your breath away the first time you see it, and still impress you every time after that. Bond's intervention of the terrorist attack on the airliner is equally impressive. All of the fight scenes are very well done and leave nothing to be desired. And the action is never 'too much', balancing itself perfectly with the storyline. As probably a quarter of the film takes place in a Casino while Bond tries to win a high-stakes Poker game, there's plenty of poker in the movie. As someone that knows practically nothing about Poker, there was a significant chance that I would be totally lost during these scenes. But the filmmakers did an excellent job of keeping things simple enough to keep those of us that know nothing right along with those Poker experts that be watching as well. Along with the focus of the game, they are also able to keep the tension high as you wait expectantly for the final results. All together, Casino Royale isn't just the best Bond movie. It's an excellent film that can appeal not to just fans, but to those that have never previously been interested in Bond. Now, I just have to wait for the sequel.",positive
"While interesting... I thought it was poor form to make Daniel Craigs first bond one in which he is supposed to play poorly. He did it well, but it wasn't effective at showing his real skill.",negative
Excellent movie! The best Bond movie of them all!!!,positive
I have to give this at least 4 stars for the opening foot chase alone. Amazing,positive
"Seriously not true Bond, just an action film to me",negative
bond...klister bond you may call me tape,negative
"Honestly, I never really understood the hallebalhoo about Daniel Craig not being a good James Bond. After watching Layer Cake, I thought there would be no one better suited for the role. Casino Royale is probably the best Bond movie, not only because it a good action/spy movie, but also because it saved the franchise from the limping caricature that it had become. Only the very best part of the previous series was retained (Dame Judi Dench as M, with more of an edge to her), everything else was scrapped. Bond is portrayed as how Ian Thomas imagined him, an emotionally crippled, ruthless killer. Casino Royal tells us why. Craig is so good in this roll its scary, he even moves the way a military man would: back straight, clipped turns, no energy wasted on excessive movement. In all its a bleak fantastic look into why Bond is James Bond.",negative
ok action movie. but i still think James Bond should be less buff and more the Brittish Gentelman!,negative
"me gusto, es un bond bastante mas humano que los anteriores; no obstante, la pelicula me parecio algo larga y repetitiva en ciertos casos. tal vez unos 30m menos hubieran estado muy bien.",negative
"The first Bond film for Daniel Craig, and a great start. He is tough, emotionless, and the action scenes in this film are extraordinary. This is a wonderful new reinvention of Bond.",positive
"Now that's better, Daniel Craig is a Better James Bond!",positive
Finally Bond Killing people and not looking so bloody cheerful about it!,positive
"Yummmmmmmy yummmmy!! I love this 007 movie, its endless action..at first I was a bit apprehensive of Daniel Craig of playing Bond, since I was so used to Brosnan in Bond films..but well he didn't disappoint, though I find it sort of distracting how he muffles his dialogue sometimes, which makes me not understand everything he sais...The bond girl in this movie, I forgot her name, manages to play her role PERFECTLY, she really mixes all that sensualness and mystery and well somehow tortured thing goin on and plays it in a way that makes me understand her place...the twists this movie has well its marvelous - you wouldn't predict most of the scenes...I wonder how the next Bond film will top this, that for sure is to watch out for...",positive
very sexy james bond flick. love the new rugged bond!,positive
This one did a great job re-establishing J.B. as a tough guy!,positive
"Loved the chase at the start, but got a little confusing at the end. Will watch again",negative
Very good james bond movie.,positive
I only liked it because Daniel Craig is hot!!,negative
The best James Bond Actor EVER!!!!,positive
The best Bond film in my eyes and the best Bond as well. He is still as charming and suave as ever yet he also adds a rebellious touch whihc makes him alot more interesting in my eyes. Great story and lots of betrayal and love the torture scene. So Bond is a Masochist? LOL!,positive
"Nice opening chase scene, better character development than most bond movies. Some parts are quite brutal.",positive
"What you expect from a bond film. All on the screen, script sucks.",negative
Missed the 5th star because there's 20 minutes of crappy love scene.,positive
This is the only bond film I've watched the whole way through and I'm glad becuase it sucked and was way longer than it needed to be. I struggled to stay awake.,negative
"took me a while to catch up on this and im sure bond purists will disagree but i thought it was good,excellent action scenes and i thought daniel craig did very well,liked to see bond being a bit of a bastard!",negative
[color=white]Casino Royale was an amazing movie and by far my favorite. It's too early to tell but Daniel Craig may be the best Bond yet. Eva Green deserves credit as well. She was a cool bond girl and made me want to be Bond even more. The new realistic fighting seens are a welcome getaway from the fake coreography in previous bond films. This movie is to the point and worth your time and money. I can not wait for the new upcoming bond Quantum of Solace.[/color],positive
fakk me - a bond movie that isnt cheesier than a block of edam wedged between two slices of chedder,positive
"James Bond movie except with a decent storyline, return to form.",positive
Daniel Craig does a phenoniminal job playing Bond. Great Action.,positive
I was pleasantly suprised.,negative
James Bond actually looks like he can fight in this one...,positive
"Daniel Craig still looks old for James Bond, I don't think 007 started his career at 40!! It still was a great and long movie!!",negative
I've held off on watching this because I've never been interested in the Bond films. I'm glad I finally broke down. This was one of the best action movies I've ever seen. The action was complimented by the romantic/drama storyline - both were seamless. I hope there's more to come.,positive
"Daniel Craig is good as James Bond, time will tell how he develops and maintains the crown! I'm not sure how visually, it matches up to some of the other films in the series. Again time will tell!",negative
I like where bond is going!,positive
"Good twist to the original style of the bond movies. It definitely is no longer like the previous Bond movies, but is very good.",positive
"It was a long shot, but Martin Campbell, the script writers, and Daniel Craig have succeeded in reviving the Bond series with the best film since the Sean Connery days. Slick, fairly realistic, and a throughly engaging story. The importance of Daniel Craig as Bond is key. His smoldering persona fits the new characterization of 007 perfectly. One hopes future installments are this gritty, exciting, and mentally stimulating.",positive
I'm a huge Bond fan and excited to see a awesome Bond take the place of a rather disapointing Pierce Brosnan.,positive
"This movie offered a depth of character and story that some of the bond movies didn't get into. For me , this made it an excellent movie.",positive
"one of the best ""bond"" films since the days of Connery.",positive
"of all the james bond movies out there, this is definitely the best. allthough daniel craig kinda looks like some fucking russian ogre sometimes.",positive
"Easily one of the best bond films. Dark, gritty, realisitc (everything the rubbish Die Another Day wasn't) and capped of by brillant performances by Daniel Craig and Eva Green, the only bond girl to have a brian. Only real problem is the last 25 minutes drag the film out too long.",positive
"I rented and watched this movie with the expectation of seeing a fun, unbelievable, good time. What I got was a fun, realistic, non-bond movie. If this is the artistic direction new bond films will be taking great, it just wasn't what I was prepared for.",positive
"They tried once before to make Bond gritty, and what they got was Timothy Dalton in The Living Daylights. The world just wasn't ready for it yet. But they are now, and Daniel Craig blows away all the previous Bonds. I find him even superior to Connery, who may have been the original, but was still rather 2-dimensional.",positive
"Director Martin Campbell has earnt his 'Double O' credentials with this clever reworking of a world-weary paradigm. Following the cinematic success of that other indestructable J.B, Jason Bourne, it was clear that cringe inducing sexual innuendo and 'Job's for the Boys' banter with Q no longer cut the mustard with fans of the franchise. Here, there are no gadgets, no images of a post-coital Bond chalking up his latest sexual conquest. Much like the underrated 'Living Daylights,' Bond goes back to basics in what amounts to a character driven prequel that successfully humanizes Craig's 007. Let's hope the imminent 'Quantum of Solace' can build on this success.",negative
Daniel Craig was excellent as James Bond. This is a great film.,positive
"As a poker enthusiast, Bond's idotic poker playing almost ruined this movie for me.",negative
"The classic sleek, dashing and handsome Bond is replaced by a thick-set thug with patchy blond hair whose features have been pummeled into Rugby-forward cubism. The classic tongue-in-cheek, free-for-all anything-goes Bond style is ditched for a more brutal, in-your-face Bourne-again intensity. And yet... I've said before that the amazing longevity of the Bond films is due to the maintenance of a delicate, double-edged sword balancing act - between sticking close enough to the formula to provide comfortable familiarity, and yet straying just enough from the formula to provide enough originality to keep things fresh. This 2007 007 certainly does the latter, it's the biggest-straying and least cliched Bond film ever, ditching cheesy humour and sci-fi gadgets and sleazy one-liners and an almost-superhuman Bond for a tense spy story where Bond is beaten and bloodied and...falls in love!! Although the stunts aren't as outrageous as usual, thanks to Martin Campbell (the series' best director) the vibrant action is just as exciting, especially the roof-hopping and airport chases. The final Venetian 20 minutes is needlessly long and the rise and fall of Bond's emotional ability is needlessly emphasised. But as an ""introductory"" story, this hits the spot, generally, paving the way for a tougher, bloodier Bond for the tougher, bloodier new millennium. Compared to non-Bond films, its navel-gazing is limited, although compared to other Bonds it sacrifices a little irreverent fun and delight for tension and minor introspection. Let's hope the series gets a little more shallower and funnier in the future. So Royale isn't classic Bond, but it's a brilliant movie. As for Craig...well, physiognomically inappropriate for 007 he surely is, and he lacks the suavity and self-mocking style of Brosnan and Moore, and yet, in the arena of raw rugged machismo, he equals - maybe even betters - Connery. And as skeptical as I was about him before the film, by the time he delivered the final (and awesomely, cleverly timed) line of the picture, I couldn't have agreed with him more. ""The name's Bond...James Bond.""",positive
"That'll do Craig, that'll do.",positive
This James Bond is crap.,negative
Probably the greatest movie ever made in my life time ( at least untill the next one),positive
Craig as007 rocks! I think it's the best 007,positive
"What can I say? It's Bond, updated and renewed. I can't say I'm a big fan of the new Bond (I'm a Moore man), but he still does a good job, and will probably do pretty well as Bond in the next few movies. This entry marks an interesting change for the series, with much less emphasis on the gadgets and snappy one-liners (barely even five in this one), and more on the characters. Bond is fleshed out a bit, but I was woefully dissapointed with the villian. It was a bit difficult to see how he was really the bad guy and out to get bond, and he kept getting beat up by other bad guys. Very un-criminal-mastermind-like. I did add 1/2 a star, though, for the opening sequence with the Parkour. That was a really excellent run through, I gotta give them props for it.",negative
"great start, lots of action, good storyline",positive
"A great film, but not the best Bond",positive
Daniel Craig is an amazing actor and this movie was super intense... I highly recomend it!,positive
"As someone who has always hated Bond movies, i didnt expectt to enjoy this, yet i thought that it was utterly brilliant. They blatantly and unashamedly imitate aspects of the Bourne film trilogy to inject some much needed realism, but that's not a bad thing! Plus Daniel Craig is brilliant.",positive
"Oh Man, by far the best 007 that I have ever seen. Can't wait untill the continuation of this movie in 08. Also Daniel Craig is a best at James Bond 007!!",positive
"Me gusto la actualizaciÃ³n de Bond, se nota la influencia de la saga Bourne, la acciÃ³n cuerpo a cuerpo y la frialdad del personaje principal (Craig encaja perfectamente). Se hecha de menos los clasicos gadgets Bond, pero se agradece el Aston Martin!",negative
STOP MAKING BOND FILMS,negative
"Absolutely cracking take on the Bond franchise. I was sceptical to begin with, but was totally won over by the end. The ending was a little unclear, though.",positive
loved the opening and the very ending but why does james bond's first 007 mission take place in 2006?? no logic in that and too much feelings involved. this is not james bond film. who wants to see bond pining for some sour looking tart?,negative
i like this movie cause of all the action,positive
Best Bond yet! Daniel Craig is a motherf'n badass in this role! I'm excited to see Quantum of Solace.,positive
"Can't agree with the critics that Daniel Craig is the best bond ever, this movie did not gave me the 007-feeling. A few cool action scenes but that's it.",negative
The best Bond movie I've ever seen by far!,positive
It was nice to see some other other than Pierce for a change. Nice performance by Eva Green.,positive
Daniel was one of the best Bonds..,negative
Mads Mikkelsen rules! *kicks Daniel Craig*,positive
"finally, a bond movie with brains and heart. i liked that bond is much more human, and i liked the chemistry between daniel craig and eva green.",negative
"Not bad for an action movie, but it is not the cup of tea for 007's fan. It is totally different to traditional 007 movie, it is selling the action rather than beauty girl, haha.",negative
"Sexy. I don't usually bother with these kinds of movies and I've never seen a Bond film before, but this was different and wonderfully so. The story, characters, and dialogue were intriguing, so the action actually meant something to me.",positive
"The first few minutes to the movie and ""amazing"" came out of my mouth. The whole show was as real as possible and very entertaining.",positive
Flawless- Daniel Craig IS James Bond.Its a credit to him that he's able to effortlessly combine Connerys machismo with his own sensibilities as an actor. In other words you don't cast according to stereotype which is why Craig works and other candidates like Clive Owen wouldn't have. It also helps that its got grade A support in the acting stakes and the best script the series has had since the 60's. Martin Campbell does his best work since his TV mini series Edge of Darkness. The Bond producers do their old man Cubby proud by truly making the best Bond picture since it's hey day. Brilliant. Roll on Quantum of Solace !.,positive
the new Bond is amazing,positive
i really like this new Bond,positive
"Some hilarious dialogue ""I like to wake you James, when you smile I feel like I am reborn..."" Usual Bond catalogue of romantic entanglements ending in death. Lots of great mumbling too - ""mmdmmcmmmgmmmbmml investment.."" being a prime example. Craig the best Bond since Connery though + the best Bond in years. Awesome free-running sequence at the start.",negative
"At first, I wasn't too sure of Daniel Craig playing the next Bond but by the end of the film he won me over. Not the best Bond film of all time but an extremely entertaining one and Eva Green was phenomenal as well. Superb acting and a solid plot with some very well thought out twists and turns. I was shocked at one point in the movie when I thought something was going to happen but I was a fool for even thinking that was a true possibility. Btw, Montenegro is absolutely gorgeous!",positive
Finally...The best Bond ever made!!,positive
My name is Bond... James Bond,positive
"I quite like Daniel Craig, his Bond looks a bit distant and rough and I like that, too. But the falling in love part just... I don't find it convincing. By the way, the opening action scene is great.",negative
Daniel Craig is a fox.,positive
"Completely changes the whole Bond thing - which is good, cos the Pierce Brosnan films were getting shit. I like the brutality and adrenaline, but it is a bit long. Got me interested in poker, though...",positive
"I have very little knowledge of traditional Bond films, but I like me an action movie with a brain, and this one fit the bill. The chase scene at the beginning is worth the rental alone, and Daniel Craig makes the infamous womanizer a person as well as an icon.",positive
"A travesty. And a stupidly violent one too. Mads Mikkelsen, what WERE you thinking?!",negative
"Well, I've seen this movie many times now. Let's just say that if I had to pick a Bond movie this would be it. And the reason is so simple and clear to me: no other Bond movie managed to explore 007's soul and being as much as this one ""Casino Royale"" -- we see both the tough and fragile side of him in here. We see him getting extremely mad, then his reaction at the first killing experience, we see him in love, when broken, when mad, etc. Such a rich range of completely different emotions, I could easily watch this movie for another ten times. I still remember the moment back in 2004 when it was announced that Daniel Craig would have taken over the role of Bond after Pierce Brosnan. I remember I wasn't ok with that decision, I just couldn't see Craig playing Bond. But I was so wrong. He's just the perfect 007, he fits the part perfectly both physically and personally. The way he portraits his character makes me laugh of a genuine laugh: this is the first time a Bond movie makes me feel something more than just 'wow, that action scene is so cool!'. That's it for me. I love how we see many different sides of these characters, not only Bond. ""Casino Royale"" is a complex movie, built on many different layers. Martin Campbell did the most amazing job in bringing to life this new Bond character, while Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Paul Haggis did a great job in telling his story. I'd say go for it. Fantastic action scenes. Lovely locations. Plus poker game. And mostly, character development. Such a deep movie, you'd never expect this from a Bond movie. I also loved the song that was playing in the opening credits. Just beautiful. Absolutely recommended.",positive
"with a little more humor, this would have been a pretty amazing installment. still a great revival of the franchise.",negative
"Best Bond film yet, can't wait for Quantum of Solace in November",positive
fantastic - only let down by the ending.,positive
Craig is not the best to me but quiet good.,positive
Paras bondi sitten herra Conneryn aikaisten,positive
"I attempted to watch this on the premise everyone said it was good. Can only rate the first 20 minutes, couldn't bare any more. Bond is supposed to be sophisticated, suarve but deadly. He's not meant to be a homicidal, body building, creapy ugly man. Oh well, another couple of Mr Craig and we might get a good Bond",negative
"Terrific Bond Picture, re-invents the series for a new generation and introduces Daniel Craig quite successfully! Solid action sequences (with a nod to the opening one) and superb direction by Martin Campbell (Goldeneye) are highlights!",positive
"avis aux amateurs...ceci n'est pas un james bond, c'est bien mieux!!! Un film a revoir pour qu'enfin le mystere se dissipe sur le lourd passe emotionnel et la construction de bond par bond....enorme..",positive
Very good Bond film - best for some years. Craig is excellent and there is a bit of a story in there between all the action scenes - which are still too long and too numerous.,negative
One of the greatest footchases in cinematic history.,negative
"Since when has James Bond been anything but a wise-cracking playboy? In love? Come on now... George Lazenby had a stunted Bond career because of that. Daniel Craig does seem to bring a bit of ""coldness"" to the role that really hasn't been ever seen in Bond.",negative
"Worst. ""Bond"". Ever.",negative
best among the bond movies,positive
definitely one of the better bond films. best since goldfinger in my opinion,negative
Daniel Craig is BADASS!,positive
"This is the only 007 movie I have ever liked. and OH MY GOD, it's a great one to like!",positive
I absolutely loved this edition of the James Bond series. Daniel Craig plays it well. Most humorous Bond line in the series comes during his torture scene.,positive
"Almost half of this movie is James Bond playing poker and it was really, really boring",negative
It's a good action film but as a Bond it lacks something,negative
My kind of movie! Can't wait for the next one!!,positive
"It's nice to see a GREAT Bond movie in our day. Brosnan was great, but he didn't have a perfect movie (though Goldeneye comes pretty damn close). But this lucky bastard Daniel Craig hits the ground running.",positive

"I wasn't a Bond fan before I saw this movie. Now, thanks to Daniel Craig, I'm hooked.",positive
I did not want to like this movie...my expectations were low...I am now a Daniel Craig...007 fan. It must be his brooding demeanor...I am attracted to the darker side,negative
"4th try, finally watched this to the end. bond was so smooth and charming, this is what sold me on the movie. love a man who knows how to steal a kiss from you without you realizing he has taken anything.",positive
"Upurb movie, from the opening scene i knew i was in for a treat, a movie you can watch more than once and still be glued to the screen!",positive
"J'ai choisi Casino Royale, mais j'aurais pu mettre les 22 films de James Bond ! Daniel Craig est awesome !",positive
"Offers something for everyone--romance, adventure, wit, intrigue, violence, and of course Daniel Craig is the sexiest Bond ever.",positive
"With my huge love to 007 I didn;t liked it at all, very poor casting in my opinion, Brosnan 100 times better, too brutal, too simple. I won;t say too incredible cuz all of those films are like that but it could be better.",negative
"POKeR & ASToN MaRTiN, BoNd, JaMeS BoNd",positive
"Mind blowing. Bond proves he is in fact THE MAN in the torture scene. If you've seen it, you know. If you haven't, you should.",positive
good although not the best bond character,positive
This is the new Bond. Love it!,positive
Var lidt skuffet. Syntes ikke at den lever op til de andre 007 film.,negative
"I really liked this this movie; Daniel Craig brought a fresh new look to bond with attitude. Martin Campbell was great, especially with the action sequences. I am really looking forward to the next upcoming bond film ""Quantum of Solace"".",positive
"a couple problems like, why is judi dench m, why couldn't daniel dye his hair black, why is young bond so old. but the action was the best in any bond movie and really gives insite on bonds coldbloodedness in the rest of the movies.",positive
"I thought it was impossible to recast Bond after Pierce, but Daniel Craig you are the only man I know that could do it.",positive
I loved this movie. Daniel Craig did an excellent job as the new face for James Bond. Action sequence was amazing.,positive
unconventional - in length and quality - both good and bad,negative
I love the new Bond. I've always thought that James Bond should be more rugged and Daniel Craig is perfect for the role.,positive
"Very diff view of the Bond franchaise, got to love it!!!",positive
Ohhhhhh - is it possible to have an orgasm from the opening motion graphics??!! I did! Better than all the Bonds put together!,positive
Best Bond film in years,positive
After the fiasco that nearly killed Bond (Pierce Brosnan) a new man has arisen to take us on the fresh adventures of 007. The proof will be in his second seating of the proverbial pudding I wager. If anyone can keep Bond alive...he can. The name's Craig.. Danial Craig. I just had to.,positive
one of the best bonds ever,positive
"Love the new blonde Bond...never thought anyone could be a better Bond than Pierce Brosnan, but I was wrong.",positive
Didnt think he'd pull it off but he's good,positive
Best Bond Movie ever especially on Blu Ray.,positive
"Very good movie. I think that Craig is undoubtedly good choice as a new Bond. This part of Bond saga is very fancy, stylish and even aesthetic. Looking forward to see new films.",positive
"Really, this is the only Bond movie that I can stand to watch. Daniel Craig is very yummy...:)",negative
Very good! I was not a fan of the ending but still as a whole it was good!,positive
New blood for an aging franchise,negative
"VEry, very good film!",positive
It was ok in any way.,negative
"I really enjoyed this Bond movie, my favourite so far, without all the stupid gadjets, a more realistic Film.",positive
The Best 007 movie. Thank you for going back to the beginning and capturing the essence of the spy thriller. A wonderful departure from the worn out 007 franchise cliche riddled movies. Fresh and original in a overdone genre.,positive
Cool but I didn't get to finish it..,positive
Best Bond since Goldfinger,positive
"Holy smokes. This movie was awesome. I'll watch it again and review it, but... wow. After watching every Bond in order leading up to this one, all I can say is that this is the best movie from the Bond collection. Just awesome in its differentness from the rest of them - it's serious and faithful to the book of the same name. Definitely an A.",positive
Great addition to the bond franchise,positive
this film was great....action from A to Z...although the ending was very cheap....didn't expect it to happen but you know its all good =P,positive
5 stars for Daniel Craig in his trunks - yum yum!! Only James Bond film I have ever watched!!,positive
Best Bond movie to date,positive
one of the best bond movies,positive
Daniel Craig is hot!!!!!,negative
at least it was good and bloody,negative
the best bond since Sean Connery,negative
"Surprisingly quite good (despite being not really about anything)... I didn't fully follow the plot, but I got the feeling that if I had paid more attention it would hang together",negative
Daniel Craig Is The Best Bond To Date. They Made The Absolute Right Choice Going With Him. I Hope He Plays The Part For A Long While. Loved the Movie And Glad There Was Not A Lot Of B.S. Scenes. Very Happy That They Introduced Free Form Running In The Opening Scene.,positive
Not bad as a standalone movie but not really up there with the best of Bond...,negative
a return to hard edged realistic Bond,positive
A new direction of the James Bond's universe. i'm waiting fot the next,negative
"Maybe it does go on a little too much, but the action is great and Bond is finally back and better than some of us can remember. And the killer opening is not be forgotten either.",positive
"It's been an incredibly long time since we were given a James Bond film that was not only a good Bond movie, but just a good MOVIE. Of those, this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. yes, I just put Daniel Craig above the almighty Sean. Deal with it. We get to see him hurt, see him *bleed* and have it actually matter, because he's not a caricature here. He's still human behind that barely controlled. almost-sociopath exterior. While there are several points when the actual poker game gets going that it drags slightly, the script is excellent, and keeps the tension rather high, the action very appropriately shockingly fast and brutal, and the romance rather believable. Really, in pretty much every area, Casino Royale manages to get things right and keep them there. Great script (for the most part) very strong directing and camera work, and stand out performances from all the leads...it's going to be very hard to out-do this next time. It's one hell of a new watermark.",positive
"I had high hopes for Daniel Craig, he really could be a good Bond but didn't quite deliver if you ask me. Nice anyway to see a a Bond-movie that was a bit different for a change.",negative
Pierce Brosnan will always be James Bond to me.,negative
"No me gustan las peliculas de James Bond. De hecho, me irritan. El tono pedante que les dio Pierce Brossnan las convirtio en intolerantes, para mi. Por eso, se recibe con gran gusto esta entrega, que renueva la historia con Daniel Craig, sin mucha accion, pero recomendable.",negative
'Bond' how it should be!,positive
decent enough film daniel craig is better then that pick brosnan,negative
Bringing Bond back to his roots. I liked it.,positive
The best Bond film yet made,positive
Daniel Craig is the shit.,positive
"There are things you remember about the actors who have played Bond, James Bond. Like with Sean Connery it's his charming voice. Well, with Daniel Craig it's definitely the body;)",positive
better than the other james bonds,positive
"good stuff, for once he was not the usual superhuman that he is in the other Bond movies",positive
daniel craig looks so cute in it,positive
"Martin Campbell (Goldeneye) brings Bond back with a vengeance....well - choreographed action...classic staples of the franchise (Bond girl...villian hell bent on destroying James/the world...grand locations & most importantly a Bond who becomes rather stirred up, not shaken ;)",negative
"Now that's how you do it! Pierce was a fantastic bond lumbered with increasingly tenuous films. Daniel is a fantastic Bond gifted with a great debut film. Raw, punchy, refreshing, and yet containing 95% of the elements of a 'classic' Bond movie, this is like the Doctor Who relaunch - aware of its own past, but looking forward. Bring on the the Quantum of Solace!",positive
If you love Bond...you'll love this movie. Modern age for a classic character!,positive
"Good Bond flick.. Daniel Craig is a great working mans Bond, and Le Chiffre is a great villain. Goes on too long, but the card games part and seeing how Bond becomes the cold, unfeeling Bond we're used to makes it worth it.",negative
"Easily the best James Bond movie. Just the right amount of serious, still plenty of laughs and action, and Eva Green is a total knockout.",positive
One of my favorite bond movies,positive
"I don't think it should have had the honour of being called a Bond movie, but it was a fun ride.",negative
"Where was Q? No Q, 1 star lost.",positive
Best new Bond Movie!! He kicks ass but finally gets his ass kicked too!!! And a blond tough Bond? Who would've thought almost strange looking Daniel Craig was such a hottie?,positive
i thought i wouldn't like it...but he is the best bond ever...i mean he is developing the character,positive
"Allthough IÂ´m a Connery-fan and somewhat a gadget-geek, this is really refreshing.. up-to-date, and the chase-scene at the beginnig is superb",negative
My favorite Bond movie. Daniel Craig is a great actor. i had never heard of him until this movie but since then I have been a fan of his and want to see more of his movies. I liked that this movie wasn't as light as the others. it was the first successful dark Bond film. I think the fact that it didn't have gadgets was the reason it worked as a darker film. It is hard to take a movie seriously when a man has pants that shoot lasers.,positive
A Nice action moviw.,negative
Will gladly watch this time and time again. Quality film.,positive
"It is quite a departure from any of the previous Bond movies. Gone are the smarmy Bond personalities, the dry wit, and the shaken martinis. Daniel Craig has done what all the other Bonds before him didn't do, he has made James Bond his own character and not attempted to imitate Sean Connery's Bond. Don't get me wrong, I like Sean Connery's Bond, it is after all the original. This movie reminds me of another movie franchise that has gotten a re-imagining, Batman. This franchise was WAY over due for a fresh perspective. I can only imagine that was the intent since this movie starts out with Bond getting his 00 status.",positive
"A well made, quality picture. The best Bond film...ever.",positive
"i enjoyed this movie, it was quite heavy and dark but i think i liked the acting and the action was great",positive
"This movie was good, but not my favorite",positive
"i like daniel as bond, but don't expect a classic from this one",negative
"I thought nobody would have an impact on the Bond Films as Sean Connery had, but Daniel Craig was just the best Bond I seen in years. This Action gem only fault as a Bond Film was that it ran 20 minutes too long. But Solid story, this one is a movie with balls!",positive
It'd be better if this movie is shorter..lol,negative
"Best Bond movie yet... I'm a huge Connery fan, but anyone who doesn't rate this can kiss my black ass.",positive
seen better bond movies,positive
"poor craig, i heard that his two foreteeth broke on the shooting.",positive
Daniel Craig... YUMMY!!!,negative
"Nos gusto mucho, es la mejor de James Bond",positive
bond as he should be .. forget the gadgets,negative
"More violence than the 007 I'm used to, but enjoyed it none the less for that.",positive
Kickass take on the Bond story,positive
The worst Bond movie ever. Daniel Craig should have played the bad guy and not James Bond. He is not convincing enough as Bond. Please give us back Pierce Bronsnan.,negative
this 007 has brought life back to the james bond series. i hope daniel craig sticks with the role,positive
modern day bond pretty good,negative
has all the required elements but never quite takes off,negative
"GREAT BOND "" BLOND JAMES BLOND"" ?? WELL IT WAS STILL GREAT",positive
Well the media in America believe that Daniel Craig is the best Bond in its franchise. its way too early to decide but you can't compare Daniel Craig to Pierce Bronsan or Sean Connery. Good Movie though,positive
sean was def the best bond...but this guy gives him a run for his money. great film....i watched it more then once,positive
"J'ai adorÃ© ce film, en plus dans la plus grande salle de cinÃ© ^^",positive
"Not bad, definately an improvement on the recent escapades of Mr. Bond... To be honest though, that's not a huge feat considering how weak the other flicks were. The action is better in terms of the hand to hand combat stuff and Craig handles that side of thing really well. The only thing is, for all of the explosions and jumping off of cranes etc. it's not that thrilling. A single episode of 24 is signifcantly more intense than what is presented here. At the end of the day I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It looks great, Craig is a good fit for the role and the more messy and dirty approach to the action is a step in the right direction.",negative
"Awsome. Aston Martins, action, poker and beautiful women. And oh so stylish",positive
My favourite Bond film. Shows how much of a fairy Pierce Brosnan was at playing Bond. Daniel Craig is the Bond that was always meant to be.,positive
Surprisingly good. Possibly the best of all Bond movies. The scene suposedlyin Mada was obviously not done in Madagascar.,positive
"What can I say? After The World is Not Enough and Die Another Day killed Bond, Sony, as the new owner of the franchise, put their brand all over this film and made one of the greatest Bond movies ever.",positive
"Bond is back,yeah baby!",positive
My favourite Bond film thus far.,positive
didn't think he would made a good james bond but was i WRONG,positive
fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
Still not sure I'm happy with the new Bond but I'll give him another shot to make or break the role.,negative
Awesome movie. Although the bond in this one is not as agile but well played poker.,positive
"Great movie, confused about the fact this is the first bond Book(so he has just become a 00 in this movie) So I guess the last 4 decades of Bond are to be forgotten.",positive
"007 is not a cool as in the past, but he is tough",negative
My favorite Bond & 007 film. (It used to be Roger Moore & Moonraker.),positive
Best bond movie since Sean Connery,positive
Frakking sweet. I hope they keep up the level of quality with the franchise.,positive
One of the best Bond films...roll on the new one in October!,positive
James Bond as it should be!,positive
the best Bond film ever made. i mean ever. this is Bond. everything before was sh****,positive
Pour un James Bond avec un aceur qui ressemble à un Russe... c bien!,negative
"Ah, Daniel Craig...good action, some things blow up, and you get a metrosexual Bond in the process.",positive
Always love Bond. I really like all the previous Bond's but I thought Daniel Craig brought a dark side to the character that was very interesting.,positive
"For me, you can't go wrong with Bond. I didn't think anyone could ever come close to Connery, but Craig was right there.",positive
One of the best resent Bond movies. Interesting is that this new type of Bond is simply better then Brosnan ever tried to copy the previous ones. Can't wait to see the next installment of this series. With the Bond of THIS century!,positive
awesome! Can't wait for the others to come out.,positive
A refreshing new direction for the Bond series,positive
I love this movie. Craig is an awesome 007. Brosnan is my favorite but Craig is a very close second.,positive
"Brilliant to start all over, with a new fresh Bond.",positive
"Craig moves right to the top of my 'favorite Bond' list. The gritty aspect of his Bond is much more entertaining than the parade of Connery wannabes we've seen. The only issue I had with it was that two chase scenes through construction areas was a bit repetitive. I have to be that petty to have something to gripe about. Looking forward to ""Quantum"" this fall!",positive
"The best Bond film in years. Daniel Craig makes a fantastic 007. Raw, unrefined, with a touch of style, but yet not ""full Bond"" yet. Fantastic.",positive
definitely one of the best James Bond films ever,positive
"A Bond movie. But not really a Bond movie. An origin story about a Cold War hero that takes place before the first 20 films but after the Cold War? Not a reset of the franchise because the same M, right? What the hell?",negative
The bond films return to form. You got to thank the Bourne movies for raising the bar and Martin Campbell for coming back to direct.,negative
The best BOND film since the old days!,positive
"I was quite surprised. Really an entertaining movie. Good job, Daniel Craig.",positive
class movie done well,positive
i love this movie!!!!!,positive
This was a very good one Bond wins again.,positive
"[b][color=black]The Best JAMES BOND EVER!!! The movie is fantastic, it has the greatest story ever and is more realistic. It has the girls, the cars, the villans and the action all packed up into this movie.[/color][/b]",positive
"better than ever, beautiful girls, nice stiry, filmed in various places. I recommend it.",positive
"An excellent Bond Comeback, so much for all those Daniel Craig Critics! Main critiscism, too many one liners from Craig!",positive
Daniel Craig. Need I say more?!,positive
other Bond movies much better than this one. Not up to the 007 movies I did not think,negative
everyone loves a bit of 007 xxshakin not stirred lol !,negative
"Palomera entretenida. NuevoJames Bond, nuevo auto, nueva chica (Eva Green es despampanante, desde Dreamers). La cinta abre con Parkour alucinante y cierra con Venecia... lo esperado de Bond. Cumplidora",negative
A rough & Tough new Bond. Personally I still prefer Pierce Brosnan.,negative
Another good addition to the series,positive
La mejor pelÃ­Â­cula de James Bond a la fecha. Punto.,positive
"Daniel Craig is a superb Bond... should have ended earlier... I'm sorry but I have to quote this favorite line from both book and movie: ""The bitch is dead""",negative
GREATEST BOND MOVIE u wouldnt think that daniel craig could pull it off but i think hes the best bond and the story is so awsome,positive
"this reboot of the bond franchise was a success, excellent plot...edge of seat action all the way through...",positive
Best Bond movie yet.,positive
"I had stopped caring about James Bond, and then . . .",positive
Sean! Sean is the only one!,negative
The BEST bond movie EVER!!!!!!!,positive
The bollock whacking scene is as excrutiating as it is hilarious.,positive
"Resurrected the 007 series, as much as I love Pierce Brosnan, Bond needed an update.",positive
"Despite all of those who didn't like the new Bond's looks and lack of the previous no-fight-messes-up-my-hair girliness, this one and its movie make it worth watching several times, more for me than the previous ones, which I liked pretty much.",positive
"To start with i didnt think i was going to get into it,but soon did and it turned out to be excellent! ive seen 5 times now!",positive
YES!! Great Bond film that re-energizes the franchise. Can't wait for the next one!,positive
"The best bond movie ever, sorry sean connery, you've met your match. Craig took the spot in my book for the best bond ever.",positive
Het begin van een nieuw tijdperk?,positive
"Awesome- Bond has an edge again. Goodbye and good riddance to aging, sagging playboy Pierce.",positive
a very good oo7 movie,positive
Best Bond movie I've ever seen.,positive
"About goddamned time someone pumped new life into this stale series. I'm glad they got rid of the gimmicky gadgets and focused on Bond himself. Some of the best action sequences in years, and Daniel Craig does a stunning job. Somewhat contrived plot, but it fits the genre.",positive
"[color=white]The movie was good, but for a Bond movie I expected a little more. The first thing that bothered me is Bond himself, Daniel Craig. I can't imagine James Bond having blond hair and blue eyes. And the only character to come back from a previous Bond movie is M, Judi Dench. But the fighting scenes were good, there were some cool gadgets (despite the lack of Q in the movie), there are many exciting moments, and it ends well for the next movie to continue from. It's also a relief to see a new Bond movie that's based off of Ian Fleming's books.[/color]",negative
"A thrilling display of the new line of ""better"" popcorn flicks: movies wherein script, direction, casting, and all the elements of a great movie have been tended to thoroughly. I'm a little late seeing this one because I was so headstrong that it would be another awful Bond remake. Movies such as Iron Man and The Dark Knight have followed suit of this one, and Quantum of Solace is next.",positive
Wicked re-invention of the series.,positive
"the only james bond movie i've ever seen, or want to. unless daniel craig does another one.",positive
loved thie car in this lol james bond is always good,positive
The best Bond movie by far. Daniel Craig blew everyone out of the water with his portrayal of James Bond. Saw it 3 times at the cinema and have it on DVD.,positive
"At first I could not imagine how Daniel Craig would replace the past actors who played Bond. But the opening fight scene in the restroom made me an instant believer. This was a Bond who rolled up his sleeves and got dirty when needed. You really felt that this Bond could kill you at any instant. A solid script that starts at the beginning and we see how Bond got his double O status. There were no convenient hokey gadgets to get him out of trouble and a pretty exciting Parkour sequence early on in the film. This Bond film is not afraid to let his main character get hurt, tortured (that sequence will make any male cringe), or scarred. One of the more beliavable Bond films to come around for a very long time. Here's hoping the sequel is as exciting as this one!",positive
"I wasn't used to the new face. The whole movie I was like, ""Where's Bond!? Oh, there he is."" Pretty good start to a new beginning, though.",negative
Monotonous and didn't feel like a Bond movie.,negative
Not a Bond fan... but it is okay.,positive
I love James Bond movies,positive
"Ok, so the plot was a mess and he's a bit of a thug, etc, etc. That opening chase scene took my breath away. Daniel Craig is easy on the eyes - when he emerged from the sea in those blue swimshorts, you could actually hear the women in the audience sigh. Liked it so much I saw it twice.",positive
"Daniel Craig shines in his first major starring role playing an inexperienced and very vulnerable Bond. This film restarts the franchise apparently, and if it does, then we can forget about future garbage such as Tomorrow Never Dies and Hugo Drax.",positive
"I put off watching this for a long time, i was uncertain if it would tarnish my wholesome meories of the other bond movies for which i rather enjoy, i took the plunge one bored sunday afternoon however. in all onesty the film wasnt that bad and if you take itfor what it is its quite good, hovever it was reminiscent of movies such as mission impossible. i like the fact the fact the james bond canon has been re-invisioned however perhaps ding something unique instead of copying the ""block-buster"" formula would help, bearing this in mind though it gets a well deserved 4 imho (probly bias on my part however)",positive
bond is blond no need!!!,negative
"You may not know this about me, but I am a fan of Bond. It figures largely in the family traditions. So I was very curious to see the new one...particularly since it coincided with Thanksgiving: traditional time of Bond viewing. I have heard a lot of griping about how Daniel Craig wouldn't make a good bond because he was too rugged looking, not suave enough, and blond. Well guys, the two most iconic Bonds were blond so I don't see where that comes in. I will admit I raised an eyebrow at his appearance. He is a little pugilistic for a Bond, but not being super-familiar with the actor's work, I was withholding judgement until I saw the movie. And now I can say that everyone was way off base. He's great as Bond. This was a really refreshing addition to the series and it may actually keep it going. Let's face it, the 007 movies have been getting stale. The puns were corny and forced, the plots ever more far-fetched, the bimbos ever more difficult to believe in their roles as physicists, etc. The movies were becoming cartoons. Casino Royale is not. It is a complex and interesting movie with some kick-ass acting. This is the darker side of Bond...the one behind the martinis. It's nice to see a Bond that I believe could actually kill someone. The plot has a few holes, but I'll forgive that because they didn't really hinder my enjoyment of the movie too much. I also liked the fact that since this is the Bond-becoming-Bond film, his character wasn't fully formed. This is a more rough and tumble Bond than we have seen before. It will be interesting to watch the super-urbane veneer descend over the violence in future films.",negative
It's like taking a breath after almost drowning in terrible Bond movies. Craig is a fine new Bond.,negative
"sooo good, daniel craig sooo sexy the best bond yet",positive
The Best Bond movie I have seen. Pretty good action too.,positive
"I really liked this bond film. It's the best one in many many years! It was a little slow for a bond movie though, not to mention where were all the cool gadgets?? Daniel Craig seems like a good pick for the next bond star.",negative
"This movie didn't deliver for me. Except for a semi-impressive escape done in ""parkour"" at the beginning (which by the way is the only action sequence of the movie!), the movie was very borring. It's basically a poker movie. No action. No gadgets. Only one girl. I felt a lot was missing. However, Daniel Craig makes a very good Bond. He makes James Bond's arrogance seem cooler than Pierce Brosnan. Connery is still the best though. The good: realistic and believable but not worth it.",negative
"Craig made me love Bond again. Great action, fast-moving story, good Bond girls, and did i mention Craig?!?",positive
Not bad considering im not a fan of bond just of daniel craig,negative
Right up there with the best in the series. Awesome film,positive
"For the ""First"" Bond movie....very nice!",positive
mmm a little boring... it's a 3 because I think Eva Green played her character fantastically.,negative
"A very good Bond movie. I havent seen die another day, but many said that that movie sucked. I really recommend this movie. one of the best bond movies.",positive
I don't usually like bond films but wow this film is good,positive
deserves 5 stars for Daniel Craig alone!,positive
"Amazingly it's quite good!! didn't like Craig as Bond, coz he looks more like a KGB than a Bond...",negative
Like an Ian Fleming Book,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever!,positive
The best bond movie as of yet,positive
This movie somehow makes cold cynicism look cool - not sure how I feel about that. The only Bond film that I believe shows a character that's more than two-dimensional: Bond here is more than just a cardboard cutout with stupid pick-up lines and a bevy of formulaic idiosyncrasies...and girlfriends with ridiculous (and suggestive) monikers. Good stuff.,positive
Vesper means BITTER...,positive
"I love the shower scene, so lovely",positive
Wasnt crazy about it,negative
pretty good bond movie. i really liked the ending - no BS,negative
"Gritty, good rebalancing of the series. Love the darker Bond attitude wish there was less sony branding on his gear.",negative
I gave my 4 free premiere tickets to my folks & their friends so I missed it & had to watch on dvd now it's out. This new Bond's different! Blonde with electric blue eyes & muscled body. Love the casinos & Aston Martins when he smashes the car to pulp. The scenery in Montenegro & Venice is breathtaking!,positive
"Typical for the spy genre, babes and guns, but watch this for Daniel get your socks of Craig, one of the better bond films, grittier",negative
i LOVE daniel craig - i watched this movie at least a 1000000 times ;),positive
"Excelent Bond movie! This new Bond, Daniel Craig, upholds the Bond character. Gives insight into how James Bond became the spy he is later.",positive
"I usually hate when they replace actors in a movie series, but Daniel Craig was an awsome James Bond. Very realistic, but I miss Q and Moneypenny.",positive
it is the best movie ever,positive
Total Let Down....As Compared to the other 007 movies.,negative
helt jÃ¤vla vÃ¤rdelÃ¶s...tacka vet jag sean connery o roger moore,negative
"Not as good as the other James Bond films, and I much prefer the original 1967 film of the same name, with Woody Allen, Peter Sellers, etc. The best pat of the film was the cars (and Dame Judi Dench).",negative
"Always been a big Bond fan enjoyed both the movies and books. Saw this movie opening night and it blew me away, Daniel Craig is an inspired choice as Bond, Judy Dench owns the M character. Pos. the best Bond Movie ever definatley my fav.",positive
"Kerrankin Bond, jota kelpaa katsella. Lisaa Graigia kehiin! Ai, oliko tassa joku tarinakin?",positive
The First James Bond movie that i like...,negative
One of my favorite bond films takes a different approach. Which is good as the last couple were shite. Some breathtaking action scenes and an uber cool poker game are the highlights for me.,positive
"nice,but I prefere Connery",positive
Another Bond that is well shot and little else. Often boring and never without ridicule. Should have been called Superman instead.,negative
Digne d'un film qu'on passerait sur TF1..,negative
Daniel Craig kicks a whole lotta ass.,positive
"One of the best movies ever, hands down the best Bond. I keep it in my DVD player at all times.",positive
My favorite bond movie. Daniel Craig was great.,positive
"Excelente pelicula, con mucha accion y secuencias espectaculares, se las recomiendo.",positive
"Just fun. (Maybe it's not fair to give There Will be Blood 3 stars and a Bond film 4.5. But I am rating not on the difficulty of the ambition and the genre, but how perfect a flick seems on its own terms.)",positive
"""lets make a movie that is NOT A JAMES BOND MOVIE!""",negative
"Fantastic.<br/>A retro Bond, not just the cars, explosions etc.<br/>The intelligent story makes it a 5 to me.",positive
Possibly the best Bond and Bond film since the Connery days!,positive
"Although after watching the movie, I felt the insane urge to buy a Ford Mondeo, a Sony Ericsson cameraphone, drink a Smirnoff, and then rewatch the movie on Blu-ray, Craig is one badass Bond",positive
Excellent action scenes and great dialog. Must have seen it 6 times now.. wish the airlines would get some better films..,positive
Es bueno de lo que imaginaba.,negative
"daniel craig was the perfect replacement bond--except for the blond hair...still, a great movie, with an uber cool opening fight!!!",negative
Bar far the best Bond yet.Daniel Craig does an excellent job as 007.Great action scenes and alot of memorable parts.A must see.,positive
"Two hours of people talking to each other on cell phones. Yeah, good times.",negative
"Daniel Craig is a very, very good James Bond!! I liked this film a lot and I can't help but mention the amazing baddie, the fabulous Dane Mads Mikkelsen!!! He's great!",positive
"Returned me to the magic of my youth like no other movie. I was so...grateful. Intelligent, suspenseful and character-driven instead of plot-driven. character. The next film is a continuation of this story.",positive
"By far my favorite Bond movie, Casino Royale featured the first fist fight scene I've seen that recognizes that most fights aren't martial arts-fueled, that most fighters aren't pugilists, that most participants want to end the fight quickly, and that most observers are distraught - often detrimentally - as a result. Surprisingly introspective and deeply moving, especially for a Bond movie.",positive
Great reinvention of bond.,positive
"I thought this was fun...dark, full of twists and worth a rent",positive
"My favorite Bond film. Believable hero, believable action.",positive
Excellent plot and story. Made Bond more human and multidimentional.,positive
"The stunts are brilliant, Eva Green made the movie for me.",positive
Very good movie. Starts off the new James Bond franchise quite well. Great actor for James Bond. Great plot that weaves events from the 21st century with classic elements of a James Bond movie. This is probably the grittiest and most realistic 007 movie yet. Definitely the best out of them all.,positive
"I think the plot, mission, picture and story line suited Daniel Craig. He's too sexy to be James.",positive
"Best bond movie ever. For once, Bond is a human that makes mistakes and do get hurt along the way.",positive
"It's a good improvement over the last ones. The mix of modern technology and the ""young bond"" just doesn't cut it. They could have done more with that.",negative
"Good, fun and action packed. I really like Daniel Craig at 007. The ending seemed to drag on needlessly, but still a good movie.",positive
Another cool Bond movie,positive
Wow! He is the sexiest Bond ever.,positive
"best bond movie ever - not saying much since the bond franchise has laid some real turds, but this movie had good dialogue, nice plot twists, some funny ass scenes, great stunts, good character development and a nice little love story. oh yeah, and eva green is my future wife.",positive
A brutal & stupid Bond! A bid for me !,negative

Best one yet. More please!,positive
Ahhhh! Greatest movie ever!,positive
Yeah I didn't buy she was an accountant.,negative
"Well now, that's a James Bond movie. It's very interesting to have watched every Bond film and seen the progression of modern technologies and how they affect the life and profession of the most famous secret agent on Earth. That said, I offer you, reader, my thoughts. I was very curious to see how a restart of one of my favourite franchises would play out and how I might be thrown off. I might be the only person on this globe not to have been thrown by the continuity but I know there are dunces who were. M, Judi Dench is NOT the same character she was from GoldenEye to Die Another Day. This is James Bond starting his life in the service of Her Majesty's government POST 9/11. And you can tell. Daniel Craig is a phenominal James Bond especially for these dangerous days. He's the only one of the 007 actors I can imagine taking the fight into the Al Qaeda caves and camps. Eva Green is my favourite Bond girl since Domino in Thunderball back in 1964. This is a well thought out, well played and brilliantly exceuted origin story of, what amounts to be, a very flawed and human spy for our days. I would have gone higher with the star rating but I have to say some of the film's pacing got in my way. Otherwise it rocked my socks off. Peace!",positive
Best Bond film since For Your Eyes Only. Tremendous.,positive
Best Bond film of all time . . . atleast very close!!!,positive
Love it Love it Love it,positive
"Exactly what Bond should be. I desperately hope they stay with this format. Granted, some people may not enjoy the torture scene, but kudos to the makers for not making it graphic, and for adding some comic relief. All those years I waited for Brosnan - for what? Welcome Daniel Craig!",positive
What's the fuss about a blonde Bond?,negative
"this is an absolute shambles!!!! first they take the p**s out of the REAL bonds (pierce, sean and roger) it's supposed to be set BEFORE the rest, so i don't know why they have 2006 in there or that aston martin it completely and utterly sucked!! ithe only good thing about it was the song half a star at the most!!!!! what the hell was martin or daniel THINKING????????????????????",negative
Best Bond film for a long long time.,positive
"At first I was a little skeptical about Daniel Craig becoming the newest James Bond, but he brings a fresh view to a series that needed a reset. Don't be fooled by the running time, the movies does NOT feel like 2 and a half hours. It runs smoothly and is one of the more tense entries in the series.",positive
LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! best bond movie ever!,positive
"Catchy action movie, standard level of Bond-movies.",positive
it was good. i think. haha,positive
"Never really liked Bond films, but this was fantastic. loved it",positive
Excellent - the proof of this is I didn't fall asleep whilst watching!,positive
"Saying, ""This is the best Bond movie, ever!"" is like saying, ""This is the best haggis, ever!"" That said, this is the best Bond movie, ever!",negative
The best Bond for many years.,positive
"eh, it was kinda okay-didnt really lyk it",negative
"I don't dig Bond movies ... usually, but this one was actually good. Although Craig's Bond is incredibly fugly, he fully realizes the character in a way that's never been done before. Add to that fact that the movie is plausible, if far-fetched, and this is easily the best of Bond films. Perhaps fans of the series' over the top technology and ""classy"" bawdiness wont' like it, but it's hands down my favorite entry in the aging series.",negative
"For a James Bond film, this is not bad. And for once, James Bond could get injured and make mistakes! There's some mysterious aura around Daniel Craig in this movie, making me really like this movie. James Bond fans, you have got to see this.",positive
"LO MEJOR DE EL 2006 , ESTOY EN ANSIAS PARA EL ESTRENO DE QUUANTUM OF SOLACE NOV 2008 WWW.007.COM",positive
Excellent Bond movie. Relied less on the special effects then the typical Bond movie. Made James Bond seem more realistic then previous Bonds.,positive
I think he made a wonderful James Bond. I can't wait to batch the next one.,negative
"Sean Connery has always been my fave Bond,so was doubtful when I heard they'd chosen a blonde Bond.OMG ! Daniel Craig is great as Bond,rough and sexy.He has the loveliest eyes and the scene where he emerges from the sea in those tight trunks with the water rippling off his buff bod...(goes for a lie down...!) Ok,calm now...the action scenes are great,especially the opening scene on the crane.This is Bond going back to basics and into this century.Loved it !",positive
one of the best movies ever,positive
oooh la la....Daniel Craig.,positive
I think it was great. Definitely the best Bond I've seen in awhile.,positive
"One of, if not THE best bond film out there. Reinvents him without making him too different. Gets rid of all the silly crap and makes him a badass, stone-cold killer like connery and graces him with the charm of brosnan and the edge of dalton. No moore in sight!",positive
daniel craig is brill,positive
this movie did a great job of reviving the Bond movies,positive
I'm a big Bond fan...and this is my new fav!,positive
it was a good movie...and did ya kno that daniel craig signed for more than a Jams bond movie!!??,positive
FANTASTIC LOVE IT!!!,positive
"Craig makes a great manly action packed testosterone driven run as 007 with Green as a stunning, sexy, and seductive Bong girl.",positive
On l'a critiquÃÂ© avant d'avoir pu le regarder... Je trouve qu'il est le meilleur James Bond... l'un des rares qui m'est convaincu de la classe de 007... Une facette sauvage et romantique du personnage... J'ai tout simplement adorÃÂ©,positive
best bond movie ever.,positive
Reinvention of the bond series that I don't think anyone saw coming. This is not the Caisno Royale that spoofed the books that launched this franchise.,positive
"At the premiere the host said ""The bond for the new millenium"", I had to agree.",positive
Daniel Craig was brilliant in this bond movie... cannot wait for the next one!,positive
Daniel Craig did the trick of getting us away from the catalog model Bonds and silly ambience of most of the productions since Connery and brings it back to the suave badass JB is supposed to be. I just now saw the DVD. It made my day. I'll start saving my pennies now for the next Craig Bond caper at the regular movie theaters.....well done...hope they keep it up.....Johnny Webb,positive
most realistic bond film... but connery is so much better(like a fine wine),negative
Who could have imagined a Bond film could ever be this cool again?,positive
"Best Bond movie in a long, long time.",positive
Daniel Craig continues the 007 franchise minus some of the stuff people have been used to in Bond movies like the ultra-tech gadgets.,negative
Ok... but Daniel Craig fails @ James Bond. Bring back Pierce Brosnan!,negative
"Was never a fan of Bond till i saw this, awesome, back to basics",positive
"Best bond film ever, cant wait to see Quantum of Solace",positive

"Not bad, some good action in this one.",negative
what a way to introduce par-kour into the states,negative

pretty good. i need to buy it.,negative
The Bond franchise seems to be in very good hands.,positive
"throw away the wrist watch laser, the pen tazer, all of those gadegts from the past Bond films...and you have an dea of what this is...straight BOND..Man to Man, fist to fist...and gun to gun...no fake spy action here...this is the most believable Bond movie YET!",positive
i thought it was a good action movie but it was not a good 007 movie i thought it was one of the worst 007 movies,negative
"Great movie. Best Bond since Pierce Brosnan. Not so heavy on the action, but doesn't need to be.",positive
"Very good, excellent action sequences, buuut just a little non-traditional for my taste... J",positive
Mest sexy Bond ever!!,positive
"""The names Bond. James Bond"" Wow, who knew I'd finally find a 007 film that I enjoyed, but low and behold I did.. Daniel Craig makes a fine 007, and the story does make you wonder whats actually going on throughout- you actually get the sense that Bond is not perfect and he may actual lose. A good movie for those, like me, who were not fans of the series.",negative
"Back to the bang-boom basics. The perfect cup of coffee to follow the triple-decker, quadruple-fudge sundae of Die Another Day.",positive
daniel craig enuf said,positive
what a fucking babe! By far the best bond film for ages full of action and none of that soppy shagging stuff! A true secret agent living by his own rules!!!!!!,positive
"Good movie! I usually don't like the Bond films, but this one recaptured my attention...",positive
forget Pieace Brosan dear i say it sean connery DANIEL CRAIG is bond james bond,positive
"A very good movie, though it didn't feel at all like a bond movie. They definitely could have changed all of the characters and names and it wouldn't have mattered because of how little it resembled a Bond movie. That being said, it didn't diminish its value as a movie overall in the least.",positive
I really loved the uptempo pace without the MTV feel.,positive
"Overall a pretty good movie. Very gritty and more ""realistic"" than previous Bond offerings--fights are more bloody, violent, and hand-to-hand as opposed to mini-missles being fired from sunglasses. My interest in Bond movies has waned over the years, probably because I'm not a 13-year old boy anymore (at least not on the outside), but this movie, despite some campy Bond moments, is really well done.",positive
i am shaken and stirred!!!! the aston martin made me so hot!!!,positive
Why is it that people who can't take advice always insist on giving it?,positive
din expect much !! but the begining chase is exhilarating !! excellent chase...is a little boring for the non-card playin fans !! worth ONE watch..,negative
"It was ok, but I didn't like this one as much as I LOVED the other Bond movies.",negative
good choice for a new bond,positive
Kindlasti parim bond.,positive
A more amature bond in this. Daniel didnt seem like a James Bond but pulled it off quite well. I saw the ending coming. Job well done,negative
"007 taken to a more sophisticated less sexist level. Plus, the blond-haired, blue-eyed, Bond is depicted as more realistic and human than the dark-haired Bonds of other generations. All-around, a good new spin on a classic idea",negative
"absolutely fantastic, the opening scene with bond chasing the 'bad' guy was one of the best!",positive
"BEST BOND in years perhaps ever? everything is 5 star, the girls the gambling the action even daniel craig's tight shorts",positive
The first good Bond movie in like 10 years.,negative
One of the better bond movies since licence to kill,positive
"A little long and disorganized, but amazing. Gives me a lot of hope for this franchise's future.",positive
Doesn't really have a James Bond feel to it but its a DAMN good movie.. And Daniel Craig is a BRILIANT secret Agent Loved it,positive
Best Bond film ever! Who doubted Craig as Bond? The best of Bond is right here!,positive
"THIS is Bond. No camp, no overwrought CGI, no mercy. Daniel Craig was born to play this role (that is, after Clive Owen turned it down, but that's a whole other tangent). A minimalist (and dare I say, realistic) take on the Bond series, Craig brings his A-game to the table, giving us an edgy, remorseless Bond, the likes of which we saw in ""Dr. No"", ""From Russia With Love"", and ""Goldfinger"". The dialogue is precise, the cinematography is, at times, breathtaking, and the story is the best we've seen in years from this franchise. Above all? Every scene pervades with an utter sense of ""cool"": THIS is what having that ""00"" attached to your name is all about! Are there shortcomings? Of course. It does feel a little long at times, and the inclusion of Texas Hold'em, and the subsequent exclusion of Baccarat (the game in Fleming's novel), is a disappointment, but a necessity to placate the masses. Revolutionary? Hardly. But proof that Bond is back? Undoubtedly.",positive
"better than some of the bond movies, but still pretty disapointing, i wouldnt recommend this to anyone",negative
James Bond A future classic,positive
what a waste of a db9. and new bond sux,negative
"O M G Daniel Craig is sooooo hot, best Bond since Connery!",positive
Better than the other ones,negative
this was a great movie a must have in any collection,positive
"Daniel Craig endured harsh criticism that he didn't fit the ideal profile of a James Bond after the 'retirement' of Pierce Brosnan. When it made its world premiere, I bet the critics were swallowing their words. Daniel Craig was as Bondesque as Sean Connery and was certainly much better than the 'not-so-serious' Roger Moore. Let alone Timothy Dalton and who's the other guy? The plot is oddly constructed with the first-third that's so typical of Bond movies. The second-third revolves around the poker table (where there's little action, but surprisingly sustainable tension). The final third is what let Casino Royale down. It serves little to the plot, while the ending is somewhat abrupt and anti-climax. But whenever I watch a 007 film, I'll have some ingrained expectations of what I should see. Casino Royale surely exceeds most of these expectations. SCORE: 7.5/10 [www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com] ALL RIGHTS RESERVED!",negative
Daniel Craig is perfect as Bond! the best so far!,positive
It's Bond. It does exactly what it says on the tin. Everything you expect to happen does but you gets what you pay for.,negative
Im a huge Bond Fan and i thought Daniel Craig was fantastic at last a believable bond i cant wait for the next onje,positive
One of the best movies of last year and the best Bond movie. Its a great step forward for the bond series with the best man for the job.,positive
best bond since the irish guy,positive
AMAZING!!! although i dont really conseder it a True Bond film... what without the Evil super villain and the easily escapable traps,positive
"Until Casino Royal, I have never watched a James Bond before, only because I didnt like Pierce Brosnan, but Mr. Craig just does the Bond for me! :)",positive
"Awesome, awesome, awesome (watched it 3 times in one day.)",positive
[img]http://gabbos.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/casino-royale-posters.jpg[/img]Daniel Craig is awesome in casino royale a must buy,positive
This movie has brought back the Bond franchise.,positive
Pretty good movie and I love poker so I was hoping they captivate that part of the movie a little more but it did have lots of action and a good plot. The only problem I had with this is it seemed like it was going to end 3 or 4 times before it finally did. Not a big Bond fan so just my opinoin but this is definately top 3 bond film for me. Behind Golden Eye and another old bond movie I cant remember the name of.,negative
(second time seeing it) This time I paid attention! Biggest upset is that he's more topless than Eva Green :-( WTF? You'd think for once these bond girls would get nekid! ANYWAYs..still doesn't compare to say GoldenEye but thanks to the same director we have another BA Bond!,positive
"best bond ever? perhaps not, since we all know that Sean Connery was the BEST! but sexy Craig does a good second runner up!",positive
o my god i cud watch this movie over and over- he is soooo fit!!,positive
best bond yet i reckon,positive
"One of the worst Bond actors, as bad as Timothy Dalton. When did Bond ever get hurt in a fight. Ugh. Music and Bond Girls aren't even memorable.",negative
"I was a little skeptical at first as to Daniel Craig being cast as Bond. However, Casino Royale is now one of my favorite Bond movies; I eagerly await Quantum of Solace in November..",positive
"I liked it - even with a blond-haired, blue-eyed Bond. The story was good, but I maybe found it a little slow at times. The little bits of humour were actually really clever as well.",negative
Craig is best ! u hv a long way to go MR bond.. n we r waiting for it ..! 5 stars !!!,positive
he's handsome for a man,negative
"the best bond movie of all time. blonde or not, craig does a wonderful job in this epic.",positive
"i agree best Bond movie ever, Daniel Craig Rocks !!!!!!",positive
Best Bond movie by far. And a Bond character I like... at last!,positive
"I don't like James Bond movies...usually. This one was good! You know, for what it was.",positive
"I don't usually care for James Bond movies, but really liked this one.",negative
Paras Bond pitkÃ¤Ã¤n aikaan!,positive
"Brilliant all action film, Daniel Craig is a truly believeable Bond, and soooo sexy, mmmmmmm could watch it just for him but the action is unmisable 10 out of 10",positive
Loses half a star because they didn't use the car.,positive
This was good but i prefer Sean and Pierce in the hunk ratings. Not sure about the softer side to Bond but enjoyed it nonetheless. Where was Q though?,positive
Freakin amazing. Daniel Craig makes a pretty good bond.,positive
"as a film within its genre, it is top-of-the-line - so it gets a ten",positive
"I'm a huge Bond fan & this is one of my favorites. Craig is the second-best Bond, behind Connery. I look forward to more installments in the future.",positive
"I'd like to thank Daniel Craig for being the first to start the recent trend of naked torture/fight scenes. Next was Viggo Mortensen in Eastern Promises, slugging it out in a Turkish bath.",negative
"without a doubt, by far the best bond film ever. daniel craig IS james bond. I can't wait for the next one!",positive
extremely good ateleast 4 new JAMES BOND,positive
Best Bond movie I've seen. The movie actually takes you through a range of emotions. What's next?,positive
Beste James Bond noensinne!,positive
"With Daniel Craig looking as good as he does, who cares whatever anyone else thinks!!",positive
"Eye-candy. Craig is impressive and a brilliant Bond, bringing good intelligence to the material, with a new direction from the script updating Bond for the present generation, wanting things clean, sophisticated, fuss-free and intelligent. Eva Green is undoubtedly the best and most stunning Bond girl, adding strength, intelligence and vulnerability to her role, resulting in a battle of the wits the Bond franchise really needed, adding fresh verve and life to an otherwise exhausted series.",positive
"I really liked the Pierce Brosnan movies, but I have to agree with everyone else, Craig is the best Bond since Connery.",positive
"Less ""Bond-ish"" than the other bonds. Great action scenes and little gratuitous flesh.",positive
"wow, now THIS is a 007 film!!! an incredibly layered and complex storyline, psychological tension, beautiful Bond women, great acting, the best poker game in a film EVER, and of course, some of the best nail-biting action scenes and Daniel Craig as the best (not to mention most bad-ass) James Bond since Sean Connery. the film also had much more of an intense, gritty, and realistic feel than any other James Bond movie before it. this is top-grade action entertainment, no doubt about it!!!",positive
"Daniel Craig IS Bond. This is a great new take on the James Bond franchise; harsh, exciting, and entertaining!",positive
"Daniel Craig takes the mantel of 007 and runs like a wild beast with it in a reboot to the 45 year old James Bond franchise. What you get is a rougher, grittier, inexperienced Bond whose ego gets in the way of the mission at times. Casino Royale opens with Bond achieving double ""o"" status and going on a mission to extract information from a bomb maker. As the story unfolds he ends up playing a high stakes card game set up by terrorist accountant Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) to pay of the losses he has collected while gambling with his clinets money. Eva Green plays Bond's treasury liason Versper Lynd who is there to monitor Bond's government staked card playing. This isn't your daddies James Bond. There are no gadgets really, no Q. No Moneypenny. This is a young Bond who isn't quite sure of himself yet will be damned if he'll let you know about it. This Bond bleeds. It rains in this Bond's world. Daniel Craig has redefined a mythic character for the new millennium. Some purists would say that this isn't James Bond and it isn't Connery or Moore. It's a style all its own, forged in the 2000's. Casino Royale is not only a great James Bond film, but a great movie in general. It's characters and storyline as top notch and play out wonderfully up on the screen. I was cynical about a blonde Bond, but I see that I was wrong. Hopefully Craig can continue the greatness that Casino Royale started.",positive
More credible as a Spy! Finally! And this movie sorta rub in a way that it was entirely directed towards the female audience don't know why.... And I must say Craig was a great cast from the casting director. In addition to the mesmerizing Eva Green.,positive
Daniel Craig in blue trunks -- left me shaken AND stirred.,positive
"Omgz, Daniel Craig. Hot, sexy, dangerous.",positive
it wasn't their best but good,negative
When James Bond History has begun,positive
pretty good bond movie.,negative
"look, i might consider myself a fanboy simply because i cant get over craig. he is one ugly mother fucker. not to mention hes blond. for me bond is more than just a character one plays, hes an icon, with characteristics. i cant bash the film becasue its fucking kick ass. if this wasnt a bond film, it would still kick ass. but because its a bond film i expect certain things. maybe im just strange, but i still like pierce better.",positive
This movie takes the cake in james bond history with the help of the most difficult action scenes and incredible plotline that will have you keep guessing until the end!,positive
We watched this movie with the Rifftraks and it was pretty funny.,positive
"A great new take on Bond, Craig's a real badass",positive
You could substitute any Bond here...except Lazenby,positive
awesome and I hate to say because I love Pierce but Craig is too good as Bond,positive
the darkest James bond yet - too bad they had to face the DB9 flipping.,positive
Best James Bond ever.,positive
better then i was expecting,negative
Not the best Bond film,negative
"In my opinion Daniel Craig is the best bond since Sean Connery, This movie moves away from the gadgets and cheesy comic relief of the 80s and 90s Bond films and gives bond a hard gritty edge. I love it brings the Bond series back to itâs glorious roots.",positive
secret agent man!!!!,negative
Best Bond flick EVER!,positive
The best James Bond movies ever...,positive
"Mis a part quelques invraisemblances, c'est un bon James Bond. Daniel Craig est parfait dans le role.",negative
for one reason only..those blue shorts!!!,positive
"1. James Bond is emo 2. Bond chicks are hot 3. Poker - sexy or not? 4. Now I have to look up digitalis and how to treat toxicity... You know what, that was my first Bond movie. And I did like it. And now when I grow up, I want to shoot baddies and be dead sexy in a suit. And have gadgets.",negative
how hot is daniel craig? i definately would (if i was not married of course!) and his acting is good too. not quite as good as sean connery but we have to make way for new talent x,positive
"This movie actually, for a brief period of time, made me like James Bond. That's powerful.",negative
"Daniel Craig's debut as 007 is arguably one of the best films in the series. The trusted formula is still present - beautiful women and locations, terrific action scenes etc. - only this time with a much needed injection of reality. Now James Bond goes through real emotions, be it pain, love or loss.",positive
Functions within James Bond convention. Script tries to stab at psychologically understandable main character and quite gets there but not quite. Music is too familiar and middleground to awake anything new. Cinematography of action scenes is so fast that it is almost impossible to gather what is happening. Too predictable. Some nice scenes though and maybe worth as a reference. The surprises are too rushed and hasty. Eva Green as a bond girl is pretty nice.,negative
Synkempi Bond. Hyvin menee!,negative

"ok I have never done a negetive review before but this movie was so bad if i wanted to watch some guy play texas hold'em for an hour i would have watched espn and the guy isn't near as cool as pierce, the best action part it the whole movie was when the car flipped. last thing where were the gadgets 007 has gadgets thats why poeple love him. this was not a bond movie",negative
The best Bond film to date. Daniel Craig is the perfect Bond.With top action and strong story it can match up with the classic Bond films.,positive
Probably one of the best Bond movies...if you don't count the ones with Sean Connery =),positive
Own stunts and amazing debut by this previously unsung Icelander!,positive
"Everyone thought this was the best Bond ever. A respected critic called it the best since Goldfinger. I just thought it was okay. I thought the movie was a bit too self-referential (e.g., his joke about not caring how the martini was prepared) and the that many Bond elements were wrong. For example, there was not a clear identifiable exaggerated villain. I miss the days of Odd Job and Jaws. Also, I feel as though in trying to modernize Bond they may have lost some of his debonaire nature. For example, he calls a woman a bitch. Correct me if I am wrong but I just don't think other Bonds have done things like that. Fair play to Daniel Craig, though, he did well with the role. Also, I liked the opening scene....Black and White and very stylized....actually, kind of Tarantino-esque.",negative
"One of the best (if not the best) Bond Movies. The raw character that Daniel Craig has portrayed can certainly rival the one that Sean Connery showed. This movie shows us Bond as Bond should be, a charming fellow but ready to kick some serious ass and doing what needs to be. Chapeau, Craig, you've brought Bond back!",positive
"Bond is back, cool, slick, dramatic and with less emphasis on outrageous gadgets and stunts and more emphasis on character building and realism.",positive
Best of the New Bonds....,positive
"For me the best Bond film yet. Stunning action and solid dialogue and story, whilst also retaining the somewhat fantastical elements of 007. Daniel Craig is also superb and with more performances like this will be rivaling Connery for the title of best Bond.",positive
Best bond film ever!,positive
"Easily one of the best Bond films ever. I never though Craig could pull it off, let alone challenge the greats.",positive
Best Bond ever. Ever!,positive
another above average bond movie,positive
"A solid movie, but at the same time a betrayal of the Bond franchise",negative
by far the best bond movie i've ever seen. it's actually exciting to watch and it's cool to see bond actually fighting.,positive
"It was so impossible, OTT, and just ridiculous. I don't like Daniel Craig.",negative
"LOVED it! Daniel Craig is gorgeous :-D Perfect mix of action, suspense, romance, comedy... definitely one of the best!",positive
Gets a star for the ball-whipping scene.,negative
"It's still a Bond movie--over the top and implausible--but unlike recent incarnations, it's a lot of fun without being total camp. And then of course there's the lovely Eva Green...",positive
the best bond film since the connery era and great film,positive
bond is going down hill ...,negative
"Best Bond film since Thunderball or Goldfinger. Great action, great dialogue.",positive
Craig updates Bond for the 21st Century with style.,positive
Thank god for this film. Literally the best Bond film since 1963.,positive
"One of,or, the best actual james bond",positive
"This is EXACTLY what the Bond franchise needed. A complete and total reboot, going all the way back to the beginning. Daniel Craig reminds me of Sean Connery's Bond, which is definitely a great thing! I understand why they modernized it, but I think they could still do these movies set in the Cold War and be just as successful. My favorite Bond film.",positive
guilty for liking it..,negative
Best James Bond ever!,positive
One of the best Bonds!,positive
"pelicula de accion, rebuena...",negative
"When i first saw the trailer i was like "" this guys can be james bond??"" , and yes he can!!! daniel craig is one of the actor that plays James Bond perfectly! The theme song "" you know my name"" is awsome!",positive
Quite nice movie... DAvid surely looking good,positive
So against Craig - hated his 007 wannabe look in the teaser posters. Then I saw the movie... and remain forever ashamed for ever doubting.,positive
"This is certainly a great deal different from the traditional Bond film. Must say that it was nice and refreshing but I wasn't completely blown away. The lines of love towards the end I thought were stupid, but most of the other shizzle was pretty good and succeeded in refreshing the franchise after the travesty of Die Another Day.",negative
"Best Bond movie and perhaps best Bond of all time, only Sean O'Connor is close!!!",positive
Bar far the best Bond yet.Daniel Craig does an excellent job as 007.Great action scenes and alot of memorable parts.A must see.,positive
"A great film that brings back the ""Old School"" James Bond who uses his fists instead of gadgets...",positive
"It has everything you could want, a much needed antidote to the abominations that where the last few Bond films. In time Daniel Craig will be credited with being the best bond ever...blond Bond rocks!!!",positive
"I hate bond movies but this one is the best ever real good movie and would watch again, the best played bond by daniel craig by far the unslimest of them of and sexy! Id only watch another bond if dc was in it.",positive
daniel craig is a great Bond,positive
Bond...James Bond....This movie was kind of a let down...especially since the bond girls weren't in the beginning.,positive
"For years I have watched and loved the Bond films. Each actor had his strength's and weakness including Craig himself. Even Sean Connery had his weak moments in his later incarnations. However Casino Royale is by far the best, most realistic, and intriguing Bond film to date. And as a Bond fan I'll even say that it is better than Goldfinger. The only reason it get four and half stars is that Craig can't pull off the final line too well. You can tell he thought about it to much. As a Bond fan that is a big deal.",positive
"liked it, d star has very alluring blue eyes",negative
As for bond films this is right up the top. Not MUCH cheesiness plus daniel craig is a cooler bond. new age,positive
omg..the way he hit him wen hez sittin on the chair...oooooo..i felt that with him:P..and the problem is that hez laughing and tellin him 2 go a little 2 the left..omg,positive
"I Didn't think Pierce could be replaced, but I actually loved Daniel even more in this role. The movie brought Bond back!",positive
Among the top 3 best 007 films I've seen.,negative
"You can't imagine how I was so glad they went back to a darker, less as humorous Bond movie. I like Pierce Brosnan, but the stories were getting dumb and too much humor in them. I wanted to go back to the suave, charming Bond of Connery and Moore, which I think they did and added a darker feel to it. Very good return for Bond.",positive
"Love this movie, cant wait for the next went!! This man sure knows how to take a beating.... to his balls! RESPECT!",positive
"How can they say this is more realistic than the recent ones when he has a fucking defibrilator built into his dashboard?! Still ace, though.",positive
"HyvÃ¤, mutta aidoksi Bond-seikkailuksi liian kyyninen, brutaali ja vailla minkÃ¤Ã¤nlaista seikkailuhenkeÃ¤. Huumorikin on aika kylmÃ¤Ã¤. MeidÃ¤n aikamme toimintaelokuvaksi toki poikkeuksellisen onnistunut, kuten myÃ¶s tÃ¤mÃ¤ kotimainen blu-ray.",positive
"They did it well. But at the same time, there was a reason this wasn't made into a movie at the time.",positive
"I must admit I was one of those people who don't believe in Daniel Craig's ability and charming to be James Bond, but after watching this movie. I gotta say goodbye to my old perception.",negative
Awesome Film! Highly Recommended. Daniel Craig fits in perfectly as bond and brings class to the role. Great action scenes.,positive
"Yeah, this movie was pretty dope! Admittedly, the only other Bond film I've seen is ""Goldeneye"" (and I slept through ""Thunderball""), but I enjoyed ""Casino Royale"" a lot. I thought Daniel Craig made a debonair Bond, and Eva Green is too beautiful for ...(read more)words. A lot of fun, a lot of action, a very pleasant surprise!",positive

"Best Bond movie, best actor to play as Bond. Looking forwardto teh next one.",positive
"A sweet movie. Danieal Craig is excactly the right choice to be James Bond. Great scenery, and great action. The opening chase scene is the best chase in James Bond history.",positive
"the best Bond. wiht real themes, and consequences. it can be looked at as ""Bond Begins"" but you know what that formula works, for franchises like this, and craig is awesome. entertainment and quality wise you cant lost with it.",positive
One of the best bond movies to date!,positive
Daniel Craig is lovely :),positive
Me decepcionÃ³. Me esperaba otra cosa.,negative
"Didn't really think I could get behind the new bond... but boy oh boy, Daniel Craig has changed my mind. This might be one of my favorite in the franchise. Nice to see Bond back... as originally designed by Ian Fleming",positive
i guess sean connery and pierce brosnan were hard acts to follow.,negative
"after preventing a terrorist attack at miami international airport, bond falls for Vesper Lynd, the treasury agent assigned to provide the money he needs to foil a high-stakes poker tournament organized by Le Chiffre... the best 007 movie i've seen so far...",positive
this was crap! i loved the first 5 minutes and hated the rest,negative
"One of the best 007 films I've seen in a while. Thank God Pierce Brosnan passed the torch, and thank God that Daniel Craig was the recipient.",positive
"So very, very, very good. Perfect action sequences, dark, gritty characters and Craig is excellent as Bond. Easily better than anything Pierce Brosnan did, and I can't wait for the next one.",positive
I saw this at a midnight showing thinking that no one was going to be there because of what the previous James Bond Films have become. I have to say that was the best thing I saw in a longtime. I thought Daniel Craig was really James Bond. Eva Green gave a lovely performance as always. (You might remember Eva in that low budget film about a American in Paris and meets two sexually liberals during a French Revolution.) Overall I recommend if you like a action pack flick.,positive
Full of action!!!!!!!!,positive
Who likes short shorts?!,positive
"Watched haf an hour, could not bear any more. Daniel Craig is hopeless.",negative
The opening scene. Maybe the coolest chase scene I've seen yet.,positive
"What a treat this is for bond fans like me, with the characteristic charisma and smartness, without an overdose of style and accessories this time around!",negative
"Daniel Craig's Bond is more like the Bond in the books than the ones we have seen in the movie franchise. He's a hard, serious, cold killing machine, and the story follows the book fairly closely by Bond standards. Great flick.",positive
the blond bond rules and reinvents the series he almost tops connery.,positive
Oozes class. Bond goes back to basics and how! Daniel Craig re-defines the image of 007 and blows the competition out of the water.,positive
"daniel craigs first Bond and he rips a new image, brilliant",positive
"The best bond movie ever,cant wait for Quantum of Solace",positive
Paras Bondi tahan astisista.,positive
"A brilliant relaunch. It uses what works for shows like 24 and movies like the Bourne series and adapts them to suit the needs of a (finally) modern Bond. Daniel Craig is a perfect blend of what made the original Bonds work, and brings quite alot to the table. He's full of bravado and machismo, while still keeping the much-needed-refinery required of a Bond. There are a bit too many chapters in this story, but for the most part, it works...and well.",negative
Daniel Craig is sooo sexy!,positive
"Never been a big Bond fan, but this was a good one...poker fan here!",negative
"the latest bond movie, like all of them.",negative
"decent bond, but where are the gadgets, cheesy oneliners, and brosnan???",positive
One of the best James bond movies since... wel for along time!,positive
master stroke of the modern 007 era! Pierce has left the building long live Daniel Craig,positive
"Another one of my top favorites. The new Bond is a cool guy, and this movie was just long enough; REALLY exciting beginning.",positive
Best Bond movie...ever.,positive
Fun fun fun! And Daniel Craig in that swimsuit! Hubba hubba!,negative
"i think since ""Golden Eye"" their wasn't good james bond movie. and this one get in to be one of the best james bond films. smart, elegent and it has more the exact amount of action and not tu much (compare to the other latest films).",positive
Waaay better James Bond than Pierce Brosnan.,positive
la scene d ouverture,positive
"Thank god for my patience. The first fight/chase scene is utterly ridiculous, overblown, long-winded and is most probably a direct result of Mr. Campbell having watched District 13 five minutes before penning the script. The rest of it is good. I personally dislike the old Bond movies but this one is sexier, more glamorous and more entertaining.",positive
"I was hesistant to see this movie with the new James Bond,but he grows on you. There obviously is a lot of focus on cards, but overall a decent action film",negative
"I am a mucho mucho bond fan been since I was a tot, before star wars, before anime, before comics I was a bond fan. Frankly after goldeneye I was on the verge of loosing interest, But then came casino royale I simple would call it the batman begins of bond not only reviving the series and character but reinventing it.",positive
"Forget you haters, Daniel Craig is at LEAST on par with Sean Connery. Some bad story-telling parts keep it from being a true classic.",positive
"James Bond's first 007 mission takes him to Madagascar, where he is to spy on a terrorist Mollaka. Not everything goes as planned and Bond decides to investigate, independently of the MI6 agency, in order to track down the rest of the terrorist cell. Following a lead to the Bahamas, he encounters Dimitrios and his girlfriend, Solange. Im givin this a 5-Star rating even if i have missed start of movie as its brilliant as far as im concerned. wow this movie is fantastic of what i have seen so far i missed the start of it but will be rewatching this and finish off my review properly lol. i love bond movies - great actors, story, and stunts were amazing loved it all i give this movie (thumbs up)",positive
Was quite good but not the best!,negative
Daniel Craig is the best bond yet,positive
Bond just got cool again!,positive
adam from framestore whom i've been working with for some projects did the opening sequence. it was really HIS world!!,negative
ben long seens I saw a Bond movie and IT ROCKS !!!!!!!!!!! And man that rope must hurt !!!,positive
The best bond since goldeneye,positive
very good and realistic apart from the plane bit,positive
What a poorly paced movie - with a strange and contrived romance scene just before a very lame ending.,negative
Excellent! Watched it twice.,positive
"This is one of the best Bond movies that I have seen in a long while. Daniel Craig's characterisation reminded me of Sean Connery's tenure as Bond. I am glad they got rid of the OTT storylines, gadgets etc. Cannot wait for the next installment.",positive
beautiful movie......,positive
the first bond movie i watched...,negative
"my favourite movie , brilliant",positive
Best Bond film yet.....,positive
The worst part was when he wrecked the Astin MArtin. I thought I was going to cry. It was so sad.,negative
How Bond should always be. Not to mention the stunt man in the first portion of the film is one of the best in the world.,positive
DC is the best bond since SC.,positive
Love love love the new direction of the Bond universe. Can't wait for the next one. I was on the fence about Daniel Craig as Bond until I saw this. Too bad they had to kill Eva Green.,positive
Best Bond (Daniel Craig) sense Sean Connery! Was awesome!!,positive
He is a great James Bond. Hope the new one kicks ass!,positive
"Beautiful Film. Of course I was hesitant at first because it's a blond Bond, but Daniel Craig left me speechless. I'd go gay for him.",positive
Daniel Craig is perhaps the best James Bond since Sean Connery. A highly action pack octane thriller that wont dissapoint James Bond fans. Just be thankful the guys not another Roger Moore.,positive
bond is back and just as good as before,positive
"Apart from a twenty minute interval of utter gayness in the middle of the film, I have to admit that this has been the best Bond film in recent years, and I look forward to Bond 22.",negative
New younger bond?? It actually works real well. Chick this movie out.,negative
"Not only the best of Bond, but the best flick of 2006. Everything about who Bond is becomes painfully clear here. It all comes down to a broken heart. Eva Green, you'll always be #1.",positive
"best james bond film for a long time, hated Brosnan and thought Daniel Craig put a great twist on the 007 character more like a mission impossible than bond- james bond is back!",positive
boring unless you are into casinos,negative
My third time watching the movie. Absolutely love it!,positive
Eva Green Yeah! anybody that doesn't like craig remember how awful Die another day,positive
"Ridding itself of the high tech gadgets and ridiculous world domination plot lines, this back to basics brawny and brutal beginner Bond (how's THAT for alliteration?) is a breath of fresh air. I was one of the many who loudly protested against Craig when he was cast. I stand corrected.",positive
another new bond that i was resistant to... but in the end i gave in.,positive
"bond is back and better than ever. daniel craig is arguably the best bond ever. he brings a sense of realism and humanity to the character that hasn't been seen since connery. wonderful action, wonderful story, and a heartbreaking twist. excellent action flick that is one of the best of the bond films.",positive
IMPOSSIBLE to follow...,negative
"Not a fan of Daniel Craig as Bond, but overall a pretty good film",negative
sad to see James Bond die...,negative
"Not the best bond movie I ever saw, NOT THE best looking Bond I ever saw, NOT THE Greatest looking Bond girl either .. but it was entertaining enough",negative
Top notch James Bond,positive
This is the best Bond film I have seen since the Sean Connery days. I must say I am not a huge Bond fan but I would watch this one again.,positive
Bond reinvented and its was sooo needed after the poor D.A.D,positive
"This is one fun ride. I have never liked any of the other Bond films, but I'll make an exception for this. This one has heart.",positive
The best Bond film in ages.,positive
I hate Craig as bond... but the movie's good,positive
"Daniel Craig looks like a Bond, he was awesome",positive
If you like action movies this should be a five.,positive
new look on bond that is a sweet look,positive
"Love Bond movies and this one restored my faith in them. It's fast-paced, action-packed and very sexy. In essence, Daniel Craig makes a perfect addition to the Bond franchise.",positive
"If you are a Bond fan, this is an awesome break from the cheesy humor of old. Don't get me wrong. I loved Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan, et al but this movie was a great and Daniel Craig was great in it.",positive
"De las ultimas de Bond, pues la verdad es buena.....junto con las otras no se tantas que son...creo que son alrededor de 12 o algo asi....en fin buena buena una de mis favoritas jajaja",negative
"Nice to finally see a good Bond flick again, since the Pierce Brosnan era seemed pretty weak.",positive
Bond is Back!!!!!!!!!! and better than ever!,positive
"Fantastic Bond film, and while I trust Craig will make a terrific 007 he needs to fill his boots for a little while longer.",positive
"First Bond movie I've ever seen and probably the best one I ever will see. In the same way the Batman series was taken back to the beginning in a more serious manner, so was the Bond franchise and it seemed to work very well.",positive
refreshing to see a new bond,negative
the best james movie in a LONG time. this movie kicks ass,positive
Absolutely fabulous....lovely locations and beautiful love story,positive
"Really a very good reboot. Just enough of the old Bond, just enough of the modern spy film and plenty of style to go with it. Not perfect but damned close.",positive
special effects are fun.,negative
The end was just a bit drawn out,positive
"A Bond movie unadultered - It's gone everything - intense action, beautiful women and impossible cases. Especially loved the Aston Martin DBS scenes",positive
i actually really liked this movie even though it's james bond,positive
"I'm not a Bond movie fan, but I really enjoyed Casino Royale. Gorgeous locations and cinematography, great stunt acting. Gorgeous in blu-ray.",positive
nobody does it better than Bond,positive
best james bond movie,positive
"Good acting, but the first half hour was a bit lame",negative
I haven't really liked James Bond movies but this was great. Craig is THE Bond.,positive
Fantastic..could watch it over and over again. Best Bond so far.,positive
"Acceptable, please find below the link for comment:- http://hk.myblog.yahoo.com/maverick4584/article?mid=1209",negative
"Grew up with Bond, and Daniel Craig is Bond for the new generation...action packed from go to whoa. Excellent...",positive
"I was very skeptical abt Daniel Craig being 007 since I loved Roger Moore & Pierce Brosnan, but after seeing the movie a couple of times & understanding it better, I actually think he did a good job as 007.",positive
Best bond since connery,positive
"This would have been an excellent movie if they had changed the name of the character and made it into some other spy movie. It was not a good Bond movie. Why not? Bond is charming and handsome. Daniel Craig is... well.. not. The Bond girl had to actually say the line ""You are quite charming, Mr. Bond."" just to remind the audience that we're supposed to find him charming. Anytime Daniel Craig held a girl's gaze for a long time it seriously detracted from the movie. It left me longing for Pierce Brosnan, Sean Connery or even Roger Moore. Still, worth seeing if you're a fan of exciting spy movies. Not so much if you're looking for Bond.",negative
"By far, one of the worst Bond movies I seen. And I seen them all. Daniel Craig is a fucking joke as Bond. Bond doesn't have blonde hair and blue eyes. Story wasn't good, the acting was good. The movie was too long. And the whole Poker scene just put me to sleep. The only good part of the movie was the opening credits. Try again!",negative
cool ..what an opener for Daniel Craig,positive
one of the few action movies i like.,negative
"I have a new favorite Bond, James Bond...The opening 10-15 minutes was awesome and Daniel Craig is amazing.",positive
"It's been a while since the last time I saw this movie, but is still fresh in my mind. This new generation portrayal of the M16 agent James Bond is a fresh and smart reboot to the series. Daniel Craig was a really good choice as the new Bond. His performance is not only really convincing, but deep and strong too. This movie has action, romance, violence (a lot) and a black sense of humor faraway from the ridiculous trail the old franchise was going. I only hope that Quantum of Solace can stay in pair with this incredible movie.",positive
"Who knew a card game could be so intense? I certainly didn't before seeing this film. I do believe that Daniel Craig is on par with Sean Connery for best Bond. This film is more realistic than Bond has ever been in years. I think the best example is in how Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) reacts when she sees a man killed before her eyes and how Bond reacts to her reaction. Craig has put humanity back into Bond and the writers and director have put humanity back into the film itself. I never liked that the Bond Girls were always so hardened, even the ones who had no experience with combat and death. So, all I can say is it is about time we put a realistic spin back into these films.",positive
Enjoyable the best Bond movie since Sean Connery.,positive
i love daniel craig as 007,positive
My favorite Bond movie yet - I am now in love with Daniel Craig.,positive
"The best Bond movie i think. As good as the Pierce Brosnan movies were, this movie is grittier and more suspenseful.",positive
"never mind the boys toys in the film, the eye candy is spectacular ;-)",positive
"This isn't your daddy's James Bond, Casino Royale is harsher, grittier, and by far the most subversive of the Bond films. Gone are the quippy remarks and the defiant Bond persona. In it's place we have a younger, less self-assured Bond who doesn't always have all the answers and lets his guard down enough to truly fall for the girl for once. Of course, he still has authority problems and continually breaks all the rules that happen to get in his way. Definitely worth seeing for the parkour sequence alone.",positive
it was a very amasing action movie,positive
"Good resurrection of the Bond franchise, Craig needs to become more like Bond and less like Bourne though.",positive
Daniel Craig TOTALLY disappointed me as Bond. They should have never gotten rid of Pierce...,negative
usually i hate bond films they're always so cheesey and smarmy but this was actually really good and more realistic than the others,positive
"Bond comes back in ways that no one predicted, when roger moore left and some unknown bloke replaced him, it sucked. A similar situation happend with this Bond, but it was the opposite effect in every sense.",positive
"the chase seen, is fucking awesome.",positive
James Bond lost of his charm - but he is cool though. Great action scenes :),negative
"Casino Royale, wow James Bond is back in da house baby!",positive
The only Bond I wouldn't kick out of bed! The film was pretty good also.,positive
"My favorite Bond so far. Bond owes a lot to Bourne, eh? :D",positive
It's a great action film but it?s not a bond film.,negative
One of the best Bond's film in decade!,positive
"Never been much of a Bond fan (probably being a girl), but this was amazing. Had great action. Craig is hot and tough and yummy. Had some of the ""Bond"" cheesiness"", but also modern enough to compete with today's action films. And Chris Cornel does the theme song - how much better can you get?",positive
Le meilleur film de James Bond,positive
james bond movies r the best! specially the old ones but dis guys hot lol,positive
B est movie Ever!!!! If you havent seen this movie then i recommend that you rent this movie.,positive
"I liked it more than I thought I would. More specifically: I liked Daniel Craig more than I thought I would. He's one of my favorite Bonds, I think!",positive
not the best bond flick ever...,negative
Daniel Craig. WOW. He is definately a strong second best bond of all time. He blows Bronson's garbage out of the world. It shows so well how Bond started of and the transition he had to make from an in your face thug/hitman to super secret agent. I cant wait to see him progress with the character as the movies continue on.,positive
Best Bond since GoldenEye.,positive
"He is hands down the coolest Bond yet, but the movie was a bit too long and hard to follow.",negative
"Best bond film in a long time. Brendan Frasier, bless him, was just to damn goofy to be a secret agent. but this new guy just beats ppl up...in a tux.",positive
"From the start, thru to the end. It kept you watching. The beginning chase scene, in my books, goes down as the best of all time! It's nice to see that more film makers are making movies the way they were written.",positive
Wow is all i can say for this daniel griag kicks butt as the ne james bond and a great story awesome,positive
"I saw this long back, it is a different kind of Bond Movie, the Bond of this one does not use his charm as such but again leaves an impression of this different 007 moviee.",positive
the best bond i have ever seem,positive
"""I don't enjoy straight forward action flicks that often, but this one was exceptional.""",positive
Was this a Bond movie?,negative
gritty. poker scene a little bit too drown out. can't wait for more,positive
"James Bond used to be light-hearted, unpretentious, gadget-ridden. You entered an uncomplicated fantasy, and enjoyed the adventure, the beautiful girls, the fast cars, and the repartee. This James Bond has no gadgets, and therefore his deeds are much more admirable than his predecessors. This James Bond has deep feelings, and doubts, and therefore the audience is invited to consider him as a real human being, and is invited to sympathise with all he does, and all what the secret services apparently do, to save the public from the ""baddies"". At the same time, he keeps the Aston Martin and the beautiful girls.",negative
"Ok, how many times should this movie have ended before it did??? And the plotline - didn't get it at all. But still some great action scenes.",negative
"One of the best Bond films. Saw this one in Blu-Ray. Great quality, Craig rulez!",positive
Super sweet! Daniel Craig breathes life back into the Bond series.,positive
Best 007 flim so far,positive
I always enjoy these films,positive
peaked at the awesome parkour scene near the beginning,negative
"Hugely entertaining movie. And like Bond, I too have a ""perfectly formed ass"".",positive
"I've never seen any of the other Bond movies, at least, I've never paid attention to ones that I have. That said, I cannot see how any of them could have been better than this. Craig's Bond is the real deal, cold, hard and awesome.",positive
"Daniel Craig's body makes me salivate. Okay, I know that might be TMI, but I don't care.",negative
Thought it was fairly decent. They did however make a fantastic reentry into one of the best movie series of all time,negative
"One of the best Bond flicks in a long time. Craig is the best Bond since Connery in his early days. Opening action footage was spectacular. Good prequel and shows a young(er) Bond who's cocky, confident yet human.",positive
Best movie of all time!!!,positive
"Daniel Craig is HOT HOT HOT as Bond. So physical and intense, but not untouchable. Loved it! Stu can't stand the torture scene. Love the line where Vesper sits down across from Bond and says ""I'm the money."" and he replies, looking her over, ""Every penny of it.""",positive
Weirdest movie ever! Go see it just for the laughs!,negative
great james bond movie. the best in the series i believe.,positive
"I really like the new, colder Bond. Great acting and a really good plot for the introduction of SPECTRE in the ""next"" movie Dr No. Although it is a bit confusing that it is openly admitted the Cold War is over, but overall it doesn't really matter.",positive
"Ok, a bond movie I like. but it has nothing to do with bond and everything to do with the stunning Eva Green. And the extremely charismatic Daniel Craig.",negative
"Easily the best BOnd since Goldeneye, and maybe one of the best of all time.",positive
"In a word, drivel. But in more than one word... The film takes place at the beginning of Bond's career, although this is strangely in the 00's not the 60's. Craig is a good Bond, he dispenses with the 'humour' of the previous incarnations. This is a good tbing, as what masquerades for 'humour' in previous Bond films may perhaps make an 8 year old laugh, but beyond that i think having a lobotomy is a pre-requisite. The film plays like some dreadful advert for 'poor' people to watch glimpes of a lifestyle they'll never have, thank f**k. Woohoo, $40,000,000 in one hand of poker, we're all supposed to say 'wow', at that point of course. I yawned. And talking of adverts, the product placement is overbearing. Do you have an Aston that flips on it's roof because you turn the steering at speed? I'll take 10 please. I didn't care about the characters one iota. In fact, it just seemed like noise whenever they actually did or said anything. OK, I know it's a Bond film not the Diving Bell and the Butterfly. I know it's wallpaper, but sometimes, can we not be given wallpaper that rises above the woodchip? Well, of course we can. We get top quality 'spy' action\thrillers like the Bourne series. It is possible to make armchair thrillers that thrill and engage. Sadly the makers of Casino Royale have yet to go to that particular movie class. What we have here is a vulgar and mindless romp whose sole grave, Craig, cannot catapult beyond the feeble boundaries of mediocrity. Avoid. Ben",negative
2.5 etoiles...parce que Ã§a parle de poker !...lol,negative
"One of the best movies, where Craig has performed. And almost the best JB movie experience. Maybe the next one is the best Bond ever.",positive
Kind of iffy at parts.,positive
"8.0/10 I saw this at a cast and crew screening in London last weekend: I'm not a huge Bond fan, but I do enjoy them on a purely popcorn level and this was definitely one of the best in recent memory. The tone is much edgier and nastier than the Brosnan movies, harking back more to Dr. No or For Your Eyes Only. The action sequences are brilliantly shot and edited for maximum impact and are some of the best out of any Bond movie. Martin Campbell, who also made 'Goldeneye', was an excellent choice and, for me, is one of the best Bond directors. What gives this the lead over recent Bonds is the more realistic feel: the exotic locales, fast cars, spectacular action, beautiful women and many other Bond hallmarks are all here but gone is the campy tone that marred, say, Die Another Day. Yes, the whole franchise is based on an entirely ridiculous and cartoonish notion but the more serious and harder-edged tone works really well here. In this context, Daniel Craig gives an excellent performance as Bond. I'll be the first to admit that I raised an eyebrow when I heard he was cast but he really makes it his own. It's hard to say whether he's better than any of the other Bonds: Connery and Brosnan felt right for the style of Bond movies they were in. Here, as suits the overall tone of the film, Bond is much more of a sadist, a cold-hearted killer with very little sense of empathy and Craig, with his piercing eyes, suits the role very well. He's charming and funny when required and totally convincing in the action sequences. The violence is less cartoon-like and flippant, too, with every punch, kick and shooting looking like they really hurt. Also, the story is just much more engaging than many a Bond film; the script's not going to win awards but it's consistently inventive and intriguing. Whilst the film has enough of it's fair share of action, the emphasis is equally on character and storyline and less on gadgets and sheer implausibility. When there isn't a huge action sequence happening, you don't miss it: the film's longest set-piece, the poker game at the Casino Royale, is as (or not more) gripping and entertaining than any of the chases and shoot-outs. The only minor gripes that I have are a slightly too long running time: the film drags a wee bit towards the end and, although it helps the tone of the film, we don't hear enough of the Bond theme tune! However, great directing and performances from everyone involved, along with Phil Meheux's excellent cinematography, Peter Lamont's as ever superb production design and all the other top-notch craft and technical departments make 'Casino Royale' a classy and very enjoyable night out at the movies.",positive
My favorite Bond movie,negative
"You should see the first 8 minutes, awsome",positive
"Eva Green seemed to be miscast. Otherwise, excellent",positive
daniel craig is officailly hot in this film. love how hes made bond a rogue,positive
Interesting twist in the James Bond kind of movies. There're some things in this movie that you didn't expect to happen.,positive
"As far as Bond films go, this is absolutely great. There was some good humor, and some great chase scenes, but I still found it too much no-brainer entertainment for me.",negative
Best bond film since A View To A Kill..,positive
"yes, it's the best one. Origin stories rule.",positive
"Slow start, but good movie.",negative
The corny sexist lines actually work in this one. Best Bond yet. RIP the original Moneypenny,positive
"Daniel Craig is the best bond to date. He isn't a pretty boy like Brosnan, a wimp like Moore, or a fogey like Connery. He's gritty, witty, and will put Chuck Norris to shame. Outstanding film. And the title sequence was actually entertaining, a major victory for the Bond film generation.",positive
"Daniel Craig is one cool cocky son of a bitch. This was the first James Bond movie I've ever seen and it was great one to start on, I'm looking forward to the sequel. For all nay-sayers, it is imperative that you concentrate and soak up every aspect of this film to fully appreciate its awesomeness.",positive
"The only James Bond movie I've seen, and it will probably stay that way--I want to keep liking it!",positive
Now I'm torn between Pierce Bronsan and this new guy.,negative
sean connery is still the greatest,positive
"It's Bond, what else do you need to know?",positive
BEST JAMES BOND MOVIE EVER.,positive
This is the only James Bond film I've seen in its entirety...,positive
i am so in lovve with daniel craig he is just so fit and now he is playing james bond he is even sexier,positive
Far better than the original film. Just the way Fleming wrote it,positive

Daniel Craig on paras bondi!,positive
Craig pulls off a pretty good Bond...James Bond. Definitely a new angle for a classic character,negative
"Loved it, Daniel Craig takes on the role of Bond fantastically..well cast.",positive
pretty good...enjoyed it,positive
Daniel Craig is superb as James Bond. Everything in it is enjoyable & thrilling!,positive
"An interesting reimagining of the Bond franchise. It works well due to Daniel Craig's charisma and believability. Incredible stunt work, especially in the opening scene and the initial chase sequence.",negative
How was this James Bond?,negative
"Daneil Craig is the worst James Bond ever. There is no spy charisma found in him. He is more suited to be a common police officer, not a soldier, not a spy",negative
I was a little skeptical of Daniel Craig going in but he was a really good Bond,positive
"Good, but had a slow patch. I would of been torn between hiting Eva Green and crashing the Aston, but I suppose it was a company car!",positive
"This is definitely the best James Bond movie ever made. Daniel Craig is also the best James Bond yet. Some plot gaps made it weird and took away from the awesomeness, but definitely worth watching.",positive
I was distracted into giving this a high rating by the eye candy and parkour. :),negative
The best Bond movie in a long time,positive
"Bond is too crazy in his motives, and what bond movie has the main plot as a card game? I mean really.",negative
Don't normally like Bond films but this was great,negative
solid bond. Daniel Craigs angry 007 rocks!,positive
"excellent film, My god how sexy is Daniel Craig! Good story and lots of action!",positive
"I am a huge Piece B. fan, so I was skeptical of the new BOND. He's just not ""my type."" However, this movie is clever, fast-paced, and modern. Both Greg and I loved watching it!",positive
"Daniel Craig impressed me as bond and am looking forward to his next one - however, hope its a better storeyline as this one was just like watching a Poker match for 2 hours, not much action at all.",negative
so i guess this means JAMES BOND movies are not going to be comedies anymore?!,positive
Daniel Craig does a great job of recreating the early bond. he is hard as nails and cool as ice!,negative
le meilleur de tous les james bond,positive
better then i thought that it was gonna be,positive
saw like half of it but it was a good half,negative
Fun stuff..and how can you say no to Daniel Craig,negative
I really liked this new Bond. He showed emotion and evoled in character which was excellent. It also gave me a better perspective as to why he became a cold blooded 007! I'm glad M was there as a thread from the past even though the time sequence was off. Judy Dench was rules!,positive
Daniel Craig is a success at playing bond....,positive
"My first Bond film and I'm hooked. Can't wait till the next one comes out, and in the meantime I'll have to see all the old ones.",positive
"Almost exactly 30 minutes to long, this movie just won't end but is pretty good until then.",negative
opening scene is fantastic... not so sure about the rest.,negative
Finally someone who is young enough to do stunt work and actually looks tough. Escpecially liked the sequence with the building sinking.,positive
"BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING!!! SRSLY, it felt like the entire movie was watching them play fucking poker, which, by the way, is a game that I HATE. I mean it seems every time I hope theres a basketball game on tv, all any of the sports channels are playing is poker. AND POKER ISN'T EVEN A SPORT! Also, Le Chiffre or whatever the fuck the villains name is..he's by far the most boring villain in any movie ever. He's good at math, how intimidating. He like doesn't even SHOW that he's good at math! Admittedly, I sorta enjoyed the beginning chase scene with that crazy black guy, but otherwise, hugely disappointing.",negative
amazin i love daniel craig,positive
"Wow, this is the Batman Begins of Bond movies. I absolutely HATED the Peirce Brosnan films, so I put off seeing this one because I just assumed the series would never amount to anything more entertaining than a shitty Laura Croft film. I was wrong. Gone is the Bond with perfect social graces, ridiculous gadgets, and cheap one-liners. This Bond is gritty, he makes mistakes, he suffers, he gets smacked in the balls, what more can I say? I might actually check out Quantum Solace.",positive
"not bad. i'm not a 007 fan altogether, but it has inspired to go back and perhaps watch some of the others. a little bit too much poker for my taste, but well done.",negative
The return of Bond! Daniel Craig is awesome.,positive
"Good movie, though I have to say, it did feel more like a good action movie rather then a real bond film.",positive
"Very different. I like it except for the torture scene. Taste: ""Sir,""(to Bond) ""would you like it shaken, or stirred?"" (Bond) ""Do I look like I give a damn?""",positive
Den bÃ¤sta Bond sedan Sean Connery.,positive
Much less playful than the Brosnan Bond.,positive

"This is a great relaunch for the Bond series, even though Brosnan is still my fave.",negative
"Horrible! I liked Daniel Craig but the movie, the story line was terrible! It was not tradtional Bond style, hated hated hated it...the torture scene was funny though.",negative
"[font=Verdana][size=1][img]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k225/Unbreakable90000/CasinoRoyale.jpg[/img] [b]James Bond faces obstacles while chasing after an assignment. James Bond[/b][/size][/font][b][size=1][/size][/b][font=Verdana][size=1][b]:[/b] Daniel Craig [b]Vesper Lynd:[/b] Eva Green [b]Le Chiffre:[/b] Mads Mikkelsen [b]M:[/b] Judi Dench [b]Felix Leiter:[/b] Jeffrey Wright [b]Mathis:[/b] Giancarlo Giannini [b]Directed by:[/b] Martin Campbell [b]Written by:[/b] Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis; based on the novel by Ian Fleming. ""Bond, James Bond."" Perhaps it is the most infamous introduction line in film history, James Bond has become a central hero among different generations and has been the feature of many spoofs. The character has been played with class by such versatile names as Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and current gem Daniel Craig. The 2006 release [i]Casino Royale[/i] is the 21st chapter in the Bond film series. It happens to be the most thrilling and human Bond film to date, or at least since the films of the 1960s. Daniel Craig beat out such names as Clive Owen, Julian McMahon, Dominic West, Henry Cavill, Eric Bana, and Hugh Jackman for the title role. Craig shows that he has the skill to carry the film, as he efficiently mixes elements of drama, action, comedy, and suspense together. Though Sir Sean Connery will always remain as the best Bond, Daniel Craig is easily the best actor to play the role. Craig didn't base his career on looks and charisma, and he has the ability to bring a whole new perspective to Bond. Putting aside Connery's one win and nomination for [i]The Untouchables[/i], Craig is possibly the only Bond player to build-up a body of work that may be recognized by the Academy. [i]Casino Royale [/i]is the first Bond novel written and it happens to be one of the most intriguing. In the story, Ian Fleming introduces us to the character we would begin to love, and the story has never found it's way to theaters. Though there was a 1966 feature called [i]Casino Royale[/i], it was simply a spoof of the rising spy-genre and had comedic actors Peter Sellers, David Niven, Woody Allen, among others playing the title role. Campbell's film is the first to take the material seriously, and we get the backstory of how James became a 007 agent. Despite my love and admiration for the most current Bond film, I admit that Campbell's project has several flaws, and I only hope the follow-up Marc Forster film with improve the new take on the series. One of the flaws of Campbell's film is that the running length is too long, and viewers begin to lose interest after awhile, though it is gained back several times throughout the film. The card scenes have important empathy to them, but too much time was focused on that plotline. Watching people play cards has never been fun and the scenes from the last 2 acts of the movie just weaken its overall strength. What the film does succeed in is bringing us a new James Bond and introducing us to a Bond girl who has more charisma and charm than any of the previous ones, which makes us actually interested in her relationship with James. Daniel Craig brings a very human side to Bond, which makes his scenes with colleague Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) intensely interesting. The two displayed more chemistry in two minutes than Pierce Brosnan and Halle Berry were able to produce throughout all of their scenes in [i]Die Another Day[/i]. The film also increases the relationship between Bond and his boss M (Judi Dench). Dame Judi Dench has been playing the role since 1995's [i]GoldenEye[/i], but she has never received screentime that has justified her presnce. [i]Casino Royale[/i] improves that and there is high hope that she will have a more central role in [i]Quantum of Solace[/i]. To anyone who has read the original Ian Fleming novel, they will be familiar with the plot of the story. The story arc focuses on the early days of Bond, who he became a 007 agent and the first mission he accomplished. Mads Mikkelsen is very sinister as the villain Le Chiffre, who is a banker for the world's terrorist organizations. Bond's duty is to beat him in a high-stakes poker game and then the pieces of evidence will be placed together from there. The simple confrontations between Craig and Mikkelsen made the boring poker scenes feel more real and intense. The starting at teach other, to the shock they had brought great tension, and actor Jeffrey Wright's role in the scenes also spiced things above. At heart, [i]Casino Royale[/i] is another action film and the sequences are marveous. Though the opening sequence has been replayed in dozens of action and Bond films, it was a great way to start off a new rendition on the Bond series. Craig has a promising future as both a serious actor and has the new James Bond. With [i]Casino Royal[/i]e being the first James Bond story, the films can build off each other and seperate from the other 20 films. [/size][/font]",negative
the best james bond flick ever!,positive
"Daniel Craig is going to make a great Bond. But sadly, this movie was boring after the first scene.",negative
"Seriously, there's a difference! Welcome emo-bond. He seemed almost real to me. 2 stars go to my favorite bond.",negative
"The film takes a brave stab at revealing the man behind the clichÃ©, and although crude and even obvious in parts, it is ultimately quite successful at doing so. There were some odd editorial choices, but this was not a big issue, for the most part. Daniel Craig is marvellous, as always, and Eva Green was a beautiful and sympathetic Bond girl. It's definitely worth a watch, although I can appreciate why Bond afficionados see it as a deviation from a winning formula.",negative
"Eva Green, WOAH mega hottie. Danei Craig did the bond part really well and cant wait for the next one.",positive
"Okay, bored me a little and Craig didnt sell himself to me as Bond. Wouldnt watch it again",negative
"awesome, rivals sean connery as the best bond, hopefully the next movies are as good",positive
Daniel Craig is a really good James Bond. A little more grit not as much suave-ality.(which is a nice change),negative
Bond reborn! with real action!,positive
"the best bond in a long time, must see",positive
This was such a nice departure from the flash-and-dash of previous Bonds.,negative
"I didn't think the franchise could be revitalized, but this was a winning movie.",positive
Daniel Craig was a great rendition of James Bond in this movie,positive
"Mener dette var bra Bond. Mads Mikkelsen er alltid svett, men kul. Synd at nesten alt som skjer er umotivert og at all humor og selvironi er borte/pinlig framfÃ¸rt. Eks: Bartender: ""Shaken or stirred?"" 007: ""Does it look like I give a damn?!"" Hold opp a.",negative
"UUUhhhh, I hate Poker....and it was all centered around it. I wanted to die T_T",negative
the best bond so far,negative
on of the best bond films,positive
"ah mr bond ,hell yeah baby",positive
"I am a Bond fan, and this was one of my favorites. You really can't top Live and Let Die, however.",positive
the opening scene = fantastic. everything else = not so much....,negative
"It got some very nice card-scenes, appart from that Craig have Moore (!) to prove.",negative
So suave! And Daniel Craig is hott!,positive
"It's Bond, what can I say? I thought it would be fairly predictable, as those movies are, but it did surprise me on several points. Has killer chase scenes, esp. the one near the beginning. I'm esp. interested to watch it, as the newest one, Quantum of Solace, is currently filming in Panama, where I live, and next week I'll work 2 days as an extra. Q of S is the sequel to Casino.",positive
"woo hoo, superb. Hate James Bond films normally, but love this one. loads of realistic action.",positive
"The best Bond by an absolute mile. Yeah, that's right.",positive
Definitely the best Bond film in a LONG time. I understood it!!! And Daniel Craig>>>>Pierce Brosnan. <33,positive
Just another james bond. Plus how many endings is this film going to have. Cinematography is good though. Not bad brits but not great,negative
This is the best bond movie of them all.,positive
It was amazing. Rather well put together...a bit far fetched at some points but that's what makes it so great...and that Daniel Craig is a beast,positive
Daniel Craig was like the little brother of real Bond who want to be like him..:) This movie really breaks the Bond image the we used to see on screen...,negative
An excellent movie. Craig proves a blonde can be Bond.,positive
"I'm a life-long Bond fan who never believed there could never be another Bond like Connery. I'm happy I was wrong. Brash, violent, intense, Daniel Craig brings Bond back to life.",positive
its not what i would class as james bond but brings the character right up to the modern times and is good viewing,positive
Worst bond i ever saw,negative
"This is a much better movie than the last James Bond film. Someone says that Daniel Craig breaks the Bond image, but i mean he`s doing good here!:)",positive
"Worst fucking ""Bond"" movie ever... it's a disgrace to the name James Bond",negative
A promising start for the blond Bond. Loses half a star because of the shameless product placement.,negative
the best bond move ever!!!,positive
"Just watched it again after seeing it in the cinema last year, and i forgot how damn awsome it is. definetly one of the best bond scripts, and a strong contender for the best 007.",positive
"Daniel Graig was a great James Bond.Really good 007 movie with a more ""human"" character and less useless fighting/flying/shooting scenes.More style in this 007.Made me waiting for the next one!",positive
"Craig makes a fantastic Bond...this is more gritty and real than many a Bond film, Bond with a soul! Eye candy for the girls (I love the inverted Honey Ryder scene where he comes nicely scantily clad out of the sea!) The ending breaks my heart though! Great film.",positive
it is ok in the begining. But starting from the middle part...... it get worse,negative
Best Bond movie yet. Classic first action scene,positive
Daniel craig..the best bond ever!!,positive
i now ♥ daniel craig!!!,positive
The best Bond movie. Period.,positive
The first Bond movie I liked!,positive
"He just isn't very ""Bond""-ish to me.",negative
"Great Bond, great car, great girl. Daniel Craig is terrific. Thoroughly enjoyable",positive
"Surprisingly well done, but difficult to swallow in some places. Then again, Bond films were never exactly treatisies on believability.",positive
"Daniel Craig is a great Bond. So difficult to put one's own stamp on such an institution and he did a good job. Great to see the sport of parcours getting some screen time to. And, oh, I got an itch down there... so painful.",positive
"Like all Bond fans, I was worried. Worried if this was the death of a franchise...we all heard the problems before release. He was blonde. He can't drive a manual car. He banged his knee. Broke his nose. And so on, and so on. What a relief. The first 5 minutes of the movie gave me a chill as the chase scene at the start of the movie confirmed that we were going somewhere we had never gone before in a Bond film. Gone were the gadgets ( no Q yet) and more grunt, sweat and the occasional tear. This raw, James Bond at its best. He is not yet the hardened, unemotive 007 you see in the previous films, and Craig is responsible for a different angle entirely. The plot is a strong one (not always the Bond films' greatest strength) and his on-screen chemistry with Eva Green is one of the best of all time, whether its the train scene, the car before they check into the Hotel, under the shower (in my opinion the best scene of the movie), and the card game, which, for contemporary audiences has been modified into a Texas Hold Em Style game, rather than the Chemin DuFur game in the book. The baddy is bad, not alot of henchmen around in this one, and his relationship with M is not yet developed. This rocketed into my Top 3 Bond films immediately (the others being Goldfinger and From Russia With Love), so it's with great pleasure that we're all waiting later this year for the 22nd instalment of James Bond. Craig's second flirt with Bond, if it's as good as this one, will put him down as an icon in the Bond legend, and no matter what opinion you have/had of Dalton or Brosnan as modern-day Bond's, will be washed away forever.",positive
It's Bond. I mean Blonde Rough rugged and unrefined. Great movie to reinvigorate the franchise.=],positive
"halvdÃ¥rlig, blir veldig lang og kjedelig.",negative
"This Bond film is by far the best Bond film since the days of Connery. Everything in this film has had the volume turned up: locations (swank casinos and Bahama resorts), Bond girls (sexy wife of bad guy and the stunning Vesper Lynd), clothes (chic evening gowns and tailored tuxes), cars (Aston Martins), and villans (murderous math whizzes and shadowy kingpins). In addition to all of this, there is a good theme song, a snappy performance by Judi Dench, and several brilliant one liners. I look foreword to the next installment in this new era.",negative
A Steve McQueen Bond. Great idea. Easily one of the series' best.,positive
"A good job inheriting the Bond's series - fancy dresses, cool cars, and hot chicks. Very nice chasing scenes. The scene where they're betting on the table is breathtaking, too. The plot doesn't provide too much imagination and the way 007 acts makes me doubt that he's the top agent of the world, such as missing surrounding details and credulity (maybe I'm too into Bourne's series...).",negative
"At first, I was a little worried about the casting for the role of James Bond since Daniel Craig is the only actor with blond hair to play the famous Bond. In this movie, we do see a different side of Bond. He's not portrayed as some semi-god who doesn't bleed, nor as an ubberly sophisticated British agent who is only seen with a clean cut outfit. I understand that a lot of people did not welcome this movie with open-arms since they are used to seeing the same type of James Bond. It's like they were molded to accept this stereotype as the sole portrayal of a 007 agent. Overall, it is a great movie. I do appreciate it that the director went to a different path that the one we are accustomed to. The acting is good, the effects are great, and the plot is interesting.",positive
"WHO casted Craig? WHERE is the Scottish accent? A blonde Bond? What happened to tall, dark, and handsome? He's all wrong.",negative
Even though its a bit boring in some parts. Its alright overall,negative
"The best Bond ever... I was never a Bond fan because of ""ladies' man"" persona and the total disconnect from reality. This movie brings Bond down to a more realistic character .. Love it.",positive
One of the best Bonds films...,positive
This Bond is the cloest to reality.,negative
Great way to start your tenure as Bond!,positive
Ma era magari il mio film preferito del 2006.,negative
It was the best Bond Film ive seen in a long time - well done Daniel Craig and everyone involved - great film,positive
Daniel Craig..................mmmm...,positive
Best Bond movie ever,positive
"The best 007 movie ever, indeed!!",negative
Bond is back in good form.,positive
"best james bond? Maybe, at least a giant leap fromt he Brosnan-Bonds!",positive
"Though I am not a James Bond Fan, I quite enjoyed this one, ESPECIALLY the chase scene near the start of the movie.",negative
"the best Bond since Connery -- and who knows, Craig may even turn out to be even better given time. yes, he really is that well-cast. and there's everything else a Bond film should have, too: exotic scenery, a party full of diplomat-types and enough diamonds to MacGyver a chandelier, heavy drinking, expensive things blowing up, clever-but-not-gratuitous gadgets (:::cough::: Brosnan-era-Bond :::cough:::), fisticuffs, torture... what more could a girl ask for, really?",positive
The best film of last year! a truely great flick! 007 is back!,positive
"OK, you've got me, I don't go to the cinema very often...",positive
Eh ... It's a decent Bond film but it might be one of the nicest-looking ones? All the gushing from pseudo-007 fans is really starting to annoy me.,positive
"Fabulous addition to the Bond franchise. A back to basics story with good character development, good story and the possibility for a great follow-up film.",positive
"excellent, Daniel Craig is excellent. In particular love the first 15 minutes opening chase scene.",positive
"Great flick, worth seeing when you can.... Cant wait for the next release to see if Daniel Craig suits the role...",positive
"Danny didn't do a bad bond. Not the best but better than I expected. I really like how this was set as when he first became a 00 agent, and that he made mistakes, contrary to that of other bonds.",positive
Bond is reinvented. Daniel Craig is what Band should be.,positive
James Bond...thats all you need to know to know its a good movie...Daniel Craig did a surprisingly good job taking over for Pierce Brosnan,negative
I like the parts I've seen.,negative
I was really tired when I watched it and I think I fell asleep.,negative
Daniel Craig...what's not to love?!? HOTNESS!!!,positive
It was interesting how a very impatient 00 agent became the James Bond we all know today. I bought this movie 6 months ago and I didn't watch it until...last tuesday.,positive
"better than i hoped it could be,40 years later they`re still getting it right at EON productions.",positive
"DC is a great transition for the new Bond, with a mentality of kick ass first, everything else second. What makes him different from other Bond incarnations is he really looks like he's working hard to get the job done, whereas the other guys had their shit pre-written for them. If that makes any sense. If anything, though, it seemed like it ran kinda short.",positive
Daniel Craig as JB is top rate. An excellent action movie,positive
Fantastic!! I love Daniel Craig as Bond.,positive
"overall, probably the best bond film...still not really my thing, but i was definitely able to appreciate it for what it was",positive
bond is back on top form. daniel craig is brilliant as the new 007,positive
James gets whipped! Uh uh uh!,positive
"This is the best Bond movie since Sean Connery. Classy yet rough when necessary, actor Daniel Craig brings this Bond much closer to the books.",positive
"Before I watched the movie, I was well aware that it was by a new actor as Bond, by a new director, and the story was about rebooting the Bond story. So in a sense it was attempting to create and present a more ""humane"" side of the infamous James Bond. Did it succeed? No, in my humble opinion. Other than this Bond actually bled, barely survived a fatal poisoning, and did not always outsmart his opponents, I saw nothing that made him more ""human-like"". The plot was empty to say the least, and stupid to say the worst. The naked torture scene was totally unnecessary and foolish, despite of the fact that Craig was quite an eye candy to some degree. And I really don't think the men's department down there would remain intact and functional after all the blows it received. The final twist about Money was just so forced that it left me felt like ""did they just make this up on scene?"" I know, I know, they wanted to portray a humane Bond. But that can certainly be done without the ball hitting and the woman betrayal",negative
"Hands down, the best Bond movie made.",positive
"My names bond, James Bond",negative
"This was sooo not a ""James Bond"" movie. Where was Q?. It should not be considered a James Bond movie. It was more like Transporter. Didn't like Danieal Craig. No sex, no smart remarks. AND James Bond doesn't get hurt!!",negative
"Also known as James Bond part 21...lol...action-packed to the brim! Daniel Craig gives us a great version of the younger James Bond in his adolessent days...And YES, to those who don't know, this is the first of hopefully many prequals to the entire James Bond saga...I still think Sean Connery was the best Bond tho!...lolol",positive
"Loses half a point for the soppy script in places, an otherwise excellent addition/reboot to the franchise. Craig's Bond is tough, smart, cold...and blonde. This movie proves that a character can thrive without the addition of years of stereotyped baggage. I'd given up on Bond in recent years, but this movie bought back my love of the concept.",positive
Not a real bond movie,negative
"THe movie is good, but Daniel Craig is not so good as Pierce Brosnan.",negative
truely back on form - a truely amazing come back,positive
fÃ¸rst bond film nogensind jeg har set fÃ¦rdig,positive
"A Bond who actually bleeds!! Only the end was a bit pale, but as the storyline for the followup goes,it wasn't to bad to do that!",positive
its good with all the fighting,positive
Daniel Craig tears up the screen!,positive
"esta movie me gusto mucho, pues me encanta la accion,,, solo q al final muy romantica, le kito lo bueno!",positive
Just got the Blu-ray so I figured I'd say that this movie is awesome.,positive
"Interesting 're-boot' of 007! Craig is suave but cocky.. very much like, well... me.",positive
its an awesome movie....he did really well..the new bond is so cool.,positive
One of the best Bond movies in a LONG time.,positive
i haven't liked any other non sean connery bond.,positive
No where near as polished as Bourne...,negative
"I'm not a big Bond fan but Craig is wonderful, best Bond ever.",positive
"The dark bond really works, just as I was begining to despair for the franchise they pull it out of the bag",positive
Craig IS Bond. Best Bond movie ever made.,positive
"this movie felt so long , but because of it , Daniel Craig became my favorite actor , no longer is he , but i still love the moive .",positive
"Even though I think Pierce Brosnan was a good Bond, I really enjoy Mr. Craig. It took me over a year to see but it was worth the wait.",positive
"My favorite of the bond films by far. Its the old bond in a new age light. Sophisticated but not only technically but emotionally as well. Usually watch bond for action and gadgets, this one hit me with a good story which was a suprise.",positive
My first Bond movie & I loved every minute of it!!!!,positive
the best everbond movie at least till the next1 with craig daniel is in,positive
"While no Sean Connery, Daniel Craig makes a decent Bond :)",positive
Not a fan of bond but this gritty and slightly more realistic approach I enjoyed. Essential but naff love story and dragged in places,negative
"I have never really liked Daniel Craig but I have changed my mind after seeing him as ""Bond"". Awesome action from beginning to end. A must see film",positive
Daniel Craig IS the new James Bond.,positive
putting it out there reluctantly.....could be my fav bond yet.,positive
"Like so many of the Brosnan Bond movies, this one has more action than talking. The start and end sequences seem to have been tacked on to fill out the time.",negative
"Great action scenes, good script and great performances makes Casino Royale a very entertaining action movie. Daniel Craig is the best James Bond since Sean Connery.",positive
Daniel Craig is a great bond. One of the best.,positive
great work by craig to win over the critics - including me,positive
"ça faisait longtemps qu'on avait pas eu un James Bond vraiment exellent ! La, on retourne aux origines du mythe. Apres le tres bon ""Golden Eye"", Martin Campbel remet le couvert et, reussit son film !",positive
Amazing Movie At the End i thought something completely different i loved this movie best bond yet and the movie was the best too,positive
My first Bond film and somehow I don't want to watch the others because this movie has to beat them all,positive
"Is that Sean Connery I see? No, but the Bond series restarts by going back to a Bond that is blunt and powerful. The way Ian Fleming wrote him. He can be cool but just barely.",positive
What James Bond should be,positive
balls of steal baby!,positive
I want to be Daniel Craig.,positive
"Who could have guessed. I'm rating the latest Bond a 5 because of the amazing Daniel Craig, the presence of real filmmaking, a plausible story, and the introduction of a flawed 007.",positive
"Best Bond movie in a long time, and the best Bond since Connery.",positive
"If you want one Bond, this is the one. Craig is easily the best Bond, eclipsing even the great Connery. Craig is the first Bond to capture the menace and danger of Fleming's Bond as well as the vulnerability. Of course, an excellent script helps.

"It was good, but nothing really happened in it. Could've been way better",negative
"About chuffin time. I suspect I am not alone in feeling sooo disappointed in the recent films, Casino was a true breath of fresh air. Quality action drama, with a good deal less cheese than previous outings. Bonza.",positive
It aint no moonraker,negative
"I'm not a huge fan of Bond films. This one was redeemable in that there was some OK action scenes, and I kind of like Daniel Craig. The nude torture scene was fairly decent, I must say.",negative
"Ok, so some of the stunts where enhanced by CGI, but they looked great.",negative
"i was dubious at first but Daniel Craig brings a sharpness to the role, and it works for me. Some of the older Bonds were too casual...",positive
i love bond again!!!,positive
"not a bond fan by nature, but really enjoyed this. daniel craig is excellent here",positive
Never a dull moment in this one.,positive
"If you ever imagined what it would be like to see Steve Mcqueen play James Bond, this is as close as it gets. A great movie. Craig is awesome, every bit as cool as Connery in his own right. Less gadgets and more grit, very much like the Bond portrayed in the books. Watch it!",positive
good remake of the old one.,positive
I just didn't think it was that great of a James Bond film...,negative
"Pretty dang cool. saving babes form bad guys, pulling off over the top action sequences, and driving million dollar sports cars, its James bond people.",positive
i hate this it was so boring,negative
"Solid debut for Daniel Craig, who is incidentally my new favorite Bond. Must see.",positive
",,,hard and merciless,,fake bond?...?",positive
one of best bonds yet!,positive
"Smart, sensual and filled with beauty and danger in every twist. This is by far the best Bond story in modern times. A Bond film with the soul of a Connery but all Craig. Thank God they made it as real as possible! Out the gadgets, out the crazy stunts, in the action, in the drama and then Eva Green, the woman who will not reveal herself until she turns Bond into 007!! They got it right! After this experience I'm sold into whatever next film of this ""Bond"" comes in the near future. Finally an Ian Fleming's Bond the way he was meant to be!",positive
"The only Bond movie I've ever been able to really sit down and watch without getting bored. A little long, but perfect for that afternoon you want a lot of none-stop action!",positive
Best Bond movie ever !!!,positive
one of the best bonds!! i mean daniel craig's body!!,positive
"I thought Bond was supposed to be a gentleman spy, not bloomin Rambo. Not overkeen on the this new bloke, but then I liked Roger Moore :)",negative

You died scratching my balls,positive

Excellent. I never imagined Bond being so human but this change was suprisingly satisfying... not to mention Craig's amazing figure ;) Bring on more of this Bond.,positive
"I was worried about a blonde Bond, but man oh man, I am worried no more. Daniel Craig is James Bond to me. Second only, to Sean Connery. This was amazing and I hope Craig stays with the character for a long time to come.",positive
I really enjoyed this movie:) He is hot as hell!!,positive
The name's Bond... James Bond.,positive
"System reboot, and the gadgets are (mostly) out the window in this brauny actioner. Craig is a Bond for the Noughties, all meaty and raw. Gotta love the ocean scene as well.",positive
"good, i havent seen any of the origanal bonds but if its anything by this they must be good",positive
This movie is freaking awesome!,positive
"The best Bond movie ever! A superb re-boot to the series and Daniel Craig is superb in this role. He's smart, rough, tough and human (a nice surprise!) Go see it, even if you have never seen a Bond movie before, you won't regret it!",positive
Very good indeed. It displays the 'real' Bond ~ a hired killer/assassin...,positive
James Bond is always the Best!,negative
"I am way behind the times, but I thought this movie was really good. Maybe I'm just slow, but I didn't anticipate all the twists and turns that were in it. It was a bond film that actually had some romance. (Albeit short-lived!)",positive
was ok but not the best bond film,negative
"The best Bond movie of modern times and only coming a close 2nd to Sean Connery. Good storyline, well produced.",positive
Bond is back to kicking ass.,positive
I don't like bond movies usually but this was really good,positive
"What needs to be said? This is awsome. All the Bond elements are here. Bigger, better and with more style than ever.",positive
undoubtedly the first decent bond movie... took how many to get it right?,positive
I didnt think Daniel Craig had what it took to be Bond..man was i wrong. This is probably my most favorite Bond film. But nobody can top Mr.Connery and thats a fact. I think the reason why i knock off half a star is the fact that i had to see Bond get tortured in a very painful manner. Girls i dont think will understand the agony we feel watching that part.,positive
Best Bond film for a long time. Daniel Craig was excellent despite my reservations when I first heard he would be the new Bond. He is a more realistic Bond and I love the cold hard edge he gives to the character.,positive
"'Casino Royale' accomplishes all it needed to. A stylistic and thrilling ride from start to finish that takes us from Madagascar to Montenegro to Venice. It's not perfect, it may not define the action film, but it succeeds in reinventing itself for a new millennium. It takes a grassroots approach, and Daniel Craig takes the character of James Bond and makes him his own. With enough bruises and heartbreak to last for at least one more sequel, there's no reason anymore to write off the James Bond franchise as mindless entertainment.",positive
"james bond rules, and this movie is awesome",positive
"Casino Royale is the best bond movie ever and Daniel Craig's performance as James Bond is superb. Realistic, exciting and loveable, Casino delivers everything i wanted and hopefully what everyone else wanted. 10 Stars for everything",positive
this is the comeback of the Bond series,positive
"All-in-all a great, much-needed kick in the pants (no pun intended) for the Bond series. I love the more real, gritty bond that Daniel Craig brings to the screen.",positive
it's all about daniel craig,positive
"Casino Royale is not a Bond flick: it is much better than a Bond flick. The 20 bond movies before this were completly different. they were just tales of a jacked British dude who drives the stick shift aston martin, gets the bustin babes, gets the gadgets, and of course kills the bad guy. but Casino Royale is different. there is no Stick shift aston, no dead villain, no Q or gadgets - but does have the best story any action movie has had in the history of movies. im not exagerating. FUCKING GREAT MOIVE!!! this is not a bond movie... its a fucking amazing movie.",positive
excellent for his 1st bond film,positive
"Very close to what the old James Bond movies were like, but dosn't compare. It is filled with amazing action sequences and smart, wity humour. But has a somewhat hard story line to follow and a movie, where it's important to pay attention to the details.",negative
Pretty good movie for the bond films.,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond!!,positive
good movie bad bond movie,negative
"Once again, I lost the storyline of the Bond movie (like all the rest) but this one was more enjoyable than the others",positive
definetely the best Bond in my opinion. Daniel Craig fits the role perfectly.,positive
Excellent film and he is a good Bond,positive
Craig sets a new standard for Bond!,negative
"Best bond. Yes, folks, I have the balls to say he's better than Connery. As for those untrue Bond fans who say, ""Oh but he's too serious and not suave."" To you I say, he was meant to be a killing machine... go read a 007 novel by Ian Fleming and then talk",positive
the best bond film so far,positive
"Edgy and raw, quite simply the best Bond movie ever. To think that I was in fury when they replaced Mr Bronsnan with a blond pretty-boy. I take all that back, Daniel Craig was an excellent Bond. If only you'd dye your hair mate...",positive
Bollock bashingly good.,positive
me lo crei...buena accion. el resto eran muy caricaturas de los exitos de los 60s,positive
"Thrilling twist for a new Bond, still a Connery fan though",negative
"Thrilling twist for a new Bond, still a Connery fan though",negative
Great Bond flick. Terrific first outing for Craig. But about a half hour too long.,negative
loved it!!! especially the beach sceen...dam he's got a nice body!!!!,positive
"Everyone likes a Bond but this one is a cut above. Balanced blend of classic Bond suave lines and punch up action, successfully avoiding the 'internet/terrorist/satellites' wave that the previous new-Bonds seem compelled to pursue. Quality over quantity.",positive
Lived up to expectations,negative
One of the best Bond ever because it is a new and revolutionary way of playing this character.,positive
the usual greatness of a bond movie.,positive
best james bond film since goldeneye,positive
"This is like the James Bond I read about in the books. Less comedy, less gratuitous sex, more brutal action. The parkour part in the intro was amazing.",positive
"Best Bond movie ever made. They took the story back to the start, replaced Brosnan and made Bond cooler than ever.Should have done all that after the last decent Bond movie - Goldeneye.",positive
"Saw it in the theater, then saw it on blu-ray.. Es Bueno.",positive
Bond Back to his best,positive
Whould have made 5 stars if Clive Owen played Bond.,positive
PiiiiiitkÃÂ¤stÃÂ¤ aikaa HYVÃÂ bondi!!!! Jatkuispa tuotanto samanlaisena. Siis varmaanki paras bondi-leffa.. Just oikea tunnelma.. ja Bondilla juuri ne oikeat synkkyydet ja olemukset.,positive
"My favourite Bond film, how bond was written - raw and crude. Craig is excellent...and the Aston is well...mmm!",positive
Il le fait ce nouveau James Bond tout en muscle. Enfin de l'action...,positive
It was like a Texas Hold 'em game peppered with awesome action sequences.,negative

Grittier than ever. 'Casino Royale' is decidedly the best 007 film since 1995's 'GoldenEye', which introduced the world to Pierce Brosnan as the slick double agent for the first time. And for a franchise that has spanned more than four decades, 'Casino Royale' returns to its roots in more than one way. Martin Campbell, who brought 'GoldenEye' to life on the big screen, returns to the helm once more to revive a slumping brand and restore it to glory. During Pierce Brosnan's stint as James Bond, there was the almost unanimous consensus that the aging franchise seemed to finally be running its course into the sunset. Where do you go when you've done it all before? You go back to the beginning, back to where it all began. And as the curtains pull back and 'Casino Royale' welcomes us to a black-and-white intro that brings us back to Hollywood's golden age, there's no question this is the beginning of a new era for cinema's most famous assassin. There's nothing slick about it, no special hi-tech gadgets to rely on. 'Casino Royale' presents us with a raw vision that aims to get inside the psyche of the cold, calloused man. Perhaps the biggest question of all, does Daniel Craig pull it off? An unorthodox casting choice no doubt, but one that takes no time getting used to. He may not have the cunningness of Sean Connery or suave persona of Pierce Brosnan, but let's not forget this film's goal of shedding its layers and giving us a portrayal we've never seen before. And with that, Daniel Craig does appear to be the perfect choice to shatter preconceptions and reintroduce us to a character who first appeared on the big screen in 1963. Craig fits the persona of a cool, calculated assassin with an edginess that hasn't quite been molded to perfection yet. He's good-looking with a sculpted body, and when it comes to hand-to-hand combat, Craig holds no punches. For an action movie, 'Casino Royle' comes in at a winded two-and-a-half hours. Excessive? Maybe. But with the right stuff, which this film certainly has, it's all apart of the journey. There are numerous action extended action sequences that, technically speaking, are endlessly impressive. And from an entertainment perspective, it's probably what you pay for with films like this but don't always receive in such satisfying doses. And when he's not making daring escapes, Bond engages in the wonderful game of poker. This is perhaps the film's greatest achievement, delivering some fantastic film moments as Bond sits opposite his target Le Chiffre (played beautifully by Mads Mikkelsen) as they engage in a high-intensity game of logic and odds that oozes with tension on-screen. 'Casino Royale' accomplishes all it needed to. A stylistic and thrilling ride from start to finish that takes us from Madagascar to Montenegro to Venice. It's not perfect, it may not define the action film, but it succeeds in reinventing itself for a new millennium. It takes a grassroots approach, and Daniel Craig takes the character of James Bond and makes him his own. With enough bruises and heartbreak to last for at least one more sequel, there's no reason anymore to write off the James Bond franchise as mindless entertainment.

"Apres avoir vu ce film a quelques reprises, Casino Royale est definitivement mon James Bond prefere. On y voit un Bond plus dur, moins raffine et superbement interprete par Dan Craig. Casino Royale est le premier dans la chronologie et donne un nouveau depart a la serie. L'action est la tout au long du film et l'histoire est une des meilleures de la serie. J'adore particulierement la scene de la poursuite au debut du film. Finalement, la chanson theme est elle aussi ma preferee des 21 films.",positive
"Again, James Bond. The name is simply synonymous with amazing.",positive
aktornya seksi bangetttttttttt,negative
"I'm sorry, I still can't handle Daniel Craig as James Bond. He's just not.",negative
A Bond film that doesn't feel like a Bond film because it's been stripped of its predictable gimmicks and granted a second chance in the mold of daniel craig: whose Bond lacks elegance and swagger but makes up for with a deadly professionalism. A heartbreaking finale and dubious conclusion introduces a new style of James Bond films for the twenty-first century.,positive
"Not my favorite Bond film that's for sure. Craig was good... but not the ""best in the history of the franchise"" as the back of the DVD case claims. Seemed like there wasn't any solid overall plot, just various Bond-esk things put in in different spots. No global domination bad guy plot, just a banker and some terrorists. Hope the next installment is better.",negative
"New bond is aite, nuthin like da olds",negative
"Craig slips seamlessly into the role of bond and becomes, if possible, even sexier than connery",positive
Simply put the best Bond movie EVER - Daniel Craig in tiny shorts!!!! enough said!,positive
the best bond in ages,positive
Nice cinematography. Too much violence. But I guess you have to expect a lot of violence in a Bond film. Maybe I had the TV up too loud. I should note that I slept through most of it.,negative
I was doubtful if Daniel Craig would fit the James Bond role. He held his own and the opening chase scene kept with the Bond movie tradition of ACTION!,positive
Best Bond movie in a long time.,positive
"when i heard daniel craig was bond i was disapointed (tho i cant remember who i had wanted to be cast) when i saw it i was so glad to be so wrong - he was fantastic, perfect, amazing. one of the best bond films and certainly the best out of teh most recent offerings",positive
007 doesn't get any better! Fantastic intro!,positive
Paras Bobd -leffa miun mielestÃ¤. Romantiikkaa ja tragediaa myÃ¶s temppujen lisÃ¤ksi.,positive
"Mmm, Daniel Craig. So much psychotic yum.",positive
Finally a worthwhile Bond movie after decades. Looking forward to the second Deniel Bond movie..,positive
"Being a huge James Bond fan am I obligated to like this? While the movie itself was good, it was not a Bond film in my opinion. And yes I admit the last one ""Die Another Day"" did jump the shark. But did they have to go all Bourne Identity on Bond? I do guess I am weighing a lot of my opinion on the fact that I can't get over the fact that Alfred E. Newman (from MAD Magazine) is playing Bond. He is completely wrong for the part, and anyone that says he's the best Bond since Connery is seriously demented. Here's my Bond actor theory: one good followed by one bad. Connery=good, Lazenby=bad, Moore=good, Dalton=bad, Brosnan=good, Craig=bad.",negative
Sean Connery was my favorite Bond until I saw this. Craig's Bond is all balls and brutality - exactly what a double-oh agent must be.,positive
Now this is how you do Bond with a great star turn by Craig who brings a heart and soul to Bond since Connery and Eva Green is just stunningly beauliful.,positive
"very good full of action,best one ever",positive
"so good, and intense. i need to see it again :)",positive
"best bond movie, and still didnt like it",negative
"I do not like James Bond films, but this was outstanding. Daniel Craig is what I imagine a James Bond to be.",positive
one of the best bond flixs yet. Daniel Graig excellent as the new bond,positive
Best Bond since sir Sean. I can't wait for the next one to come out.,positive
One of the best Bond flicks of all time. The chase scene at the beginning is probably the best one that I've ever seen.,positive
FUcking brilliant! Our family used to go watch the Bond films when they came out in the 60's and 70's but I had completely lost it with since the 80's. Then I saw this.....it just works for me. And the free running sequence in the beginning kicks ass!,positive
pretty good for a bond film,negative
The greatest Bond movie yet! Daniel Craig is by far the the best cast Bond of all time!,positive
"live long, james bond :P",positive
"Daniel Craig Ã¼berzeugt als ruhiger, skrupeloser Agent - eine gelungene Premiere als 007",negative
"Amazing. At first I was completely dismayed at having Daniel Craig acting as Bond, but he turned out to be perfect. A much darker but deeper version. This is the only Bond film that has any actual meaning, where it has character development and depth, while the other Bonds were boring and cardboard. Absolutely beautiful movie.",positive
"My most pleasant suprise as far as good movies for 2006 goes...I was expecting crap, but I got ""shaken"" and ""stirred""...well played old chap...",positive
"I'm very biased because I love Daniel, but I thought everything was fantastic. This and ""GoldenEye"" are my favorite Bonds.. hey they're directed by the same person, what a coincidence. :)",positive
I thought Daniel Craig is the ugliest James Bond. But the movie wasn't so bad. Very good Parkour/Free Running chase scene.,negative
A different twist on bond,negative
"First hour was good, but then too much focus was on a boring poker game. And then it really began to drag, before crawling over the finish line. Too long.",negative
"es muy buena pelicula,pero quiere alguien decirme donde esta Q?",positive
I love the acting and the opening credits.,positive
"Great movie, a lot of action and romance, like any good James Bond movie",positive
Best Bond movie. Its not as stupid and ridiculous as the others. Daniel Craig is B.A.!,negative
Sir Daniel Craig rescata la saga del agente ingles mas famoso de todos los tiempos!,positive
I went to the theater expecting to see a Bond film. I was sad to have wasted all that money on food and tickets!,negative
Better than I expected though it runs a little long and loses its intensity by the end.,negative
No that good. No fancy weapons like other 007 movies. Seemed to be lacking a lot.,negative
This Movie Was Ok But I Found It Dull In The Middle,negative
"Really good movie. Daniel Craig surprised me by how well he portrayed Bond. The only thing that would have made this movie better is a young Connery starring in it (but hey, I am slightly bias).",positive
Pow pow! Un des bon derniers James Bond!,negative
Bond never looked so good! Great movie too. Love the new toys and Daniel Craig & Connery clearly the best Bonds. Plus Daniel reminds me why my life goal is to be a Bond girl!,positive
"KyllÃ¤, kyllÃ¤. Bond tuli taas. Mua nyt kyllÃ¤ arveluttaa, ettÃ¤ miten se James jatkossa voisi edes kuvitella antavansa naisille muuta kuin hupia?",negative
"if you can suspend your disbelief, this is an awesome movie, could be the best bond movie.",positive
"I've never been a Bond fan but I love this movie. It's actually INTERESTING not just gadgets and hot women. The romantic scenes were a bit weak, but other than that, this film is a great new start for the Bond franchise.",positive
good as a film but not so good as a bond film,negative
this did to the Bond series what Batman Begins did to the batman series,positive
"Bond gets gritty and real. Very different from the others, but very good.",negative
Good Action movie. I missed the gadgets a lot. I don't see what all the hype is about with Daniel Craig. Loved his car too bad it got totalled. Loved the clothes. Pretty good flick.,negative
"Awesome, my favorite of the newer movies. But nothing can compare to the 80's Bond",positive
Daniel Craig IS Bond! The scene with him emerging from the surf in the blue shorts will stay with me forever!,positive
I was hesistent about accepting Daniel Craig as the new Bond but he proved me wrong. Casino Royale was very entertaining.,positive
Brilliant. Bond at his best. Daniel Craig is excellent,positive
"The best Bond movie ever. I had reservations about Craig, but he was awesome. He redefined the character in a way that makes Brosnan instantly forgettable. Rough-hewn rather than suave, better than Connery. Exhilarating.",positive
The best bond film I have ever seen! Daniel Craig suits the Bond role better than what I thought he would.,positive
Daniel Craig what more can you say!!!!,positive
THE ONLY BND MOVIE I LIKED.,negative
the earlier bonds were of great class! but not him! and the plot was also weak for a new bond to start!,negative
"he makes a decent spy for an okay spy movie, but it just didn't feel like Bond.",negative
"Easily my fav bond movie...I've honestly only seen bits and pieces of most of the early work...but I can guarantee you i LOVE the direction craig is taking. After watching this movie religiously about 2-3 times a month now, I have to bump it up to a perfect score. The movie just kicks too much ass. I know it shouldn't ""deserve"" a 5/5, but I don't care. I love it too much.",positive
"runs a very close second to Goldeneye (in my book, cuz Goldeneye spawned a kick-ass video game and introduced me to Famke Janssen. rawr.)",positive
"As soon as the gunbarrel sequence led into the credits, I turned to my friend and said ""Oh my God, this is Ian Fleming's James Bond"" I stand by that conclusion having read every Fleming Bond work, seen every one of the movies beween 5 (Die Another Day) and over 16 times each.",positive
One of the best chase scenes right at the beginning followed by a really long drawn out film with 5 endings,negative
"Tried to be objective about this film and the change of tone to a rough character, I ended up watching it three times; in the theater, airplane, on DVD, before writing this review. The character lacks the elegance of other 007 and not as aggressive as Jason Bourne. He is out there, alone.",negative
"It was very well done and I liked it. Even though I haven't seen that many Bond movies especially the classic ones, CR gets a thumbs up. = )",positive
"this may be the best damn bond film everrrrrrr""",positive
Fun to see the beginnng the Bond Story,negative
"Despite daniel craig is the james bond, this movie ace!!!!",positive
"Thank God they resurrected the James Bond series. Besides that weird scene in the shower, this movie rocked.",positive
loved this revisioning,positive
Possibly my fav Bond,positive
"All I have to say is ""the beach scene""",positive
"it was okay, but disappointing compared to all other james bond movies.",negative
Wow. Dare I say my favorite Bond movie? Craig brings masculinity back to 007.,positive
2006! - was it that long ago. cant wait to see the new one QoS,positive
"Best Bond film in years, he's mean. Great",positive
"It was good, but it might have been called ""Daniel Craig running"".",positive
"Bond Begins. James Bond: Episode I. The Adventures of James Bond and the Raiders of the Lost Cards. Whatever you want to call it, I sat there in the theater with this new revamping of the James Bond legend and said to myself, ""Cool."" Although there has been over 20 James Bond pictures that all have a similar formula, this one is a prequel, in the present...and even mentions 9/11. And I said to myself, ""Cool."" The break of formula is what the Bond franchise needed. Things don't come together like they should. They mismatch at times, and it almost feels like a Bond parody than a Bond film. A blonde Bond. The movie begins in black and white and not with the signature gun shot. Q is not in the movie. It was a more real grittier Bond that wasn't distracting with girls and witty one liners. It was a fun learning experince and that is what made it good. I left the theater wanting to watch it again and that tells me it was a good film. The life of a hitman is not easy, even when you're as invincible as 007. Thank you Mr. Campbell for another great Bond flick. Can't wait until the next one. My vote: 8",positive
Perhaps the greatest spy/action movie ever and the best 007 film by far.,positive
"Excellent. Bond is back, and badder than ever. Why is that gal at the casino he picks up in his newly won Aston Martin? She is gorgeous!",positive
"disappointing and LOOOONGGGGGG. Bond, and bonds GIRL was totally NOT hot either. What the hell!!",negative
"My favourite Bond film. Daniel Craig totally rocked as 007. This is an awesome debut from Daniel, I'm looking forward to the next!",positive
"what a wonderful movie! I like the original James Bond who can also truely love and trust other people, which makes him more like a man....i begin to have an idea of searching all the movies of the 007 series to have a look...Casino Royale was the first 007 movie that i had seen,a good start:)~Daniel is good!",positive
Only Bond movie iv seen n i loved watching it,positive
"Never in my life have I been proven so wrong. I thought Daniel Craig was gonna be a piss-poor bond and was expecting to hate this film, to my surprise he turned out to be the best Bond and Casino Royale the best Bond film I've ever seen. I like surprises :)",positive
This one gets fours stars!,positive
People were critical of Daniel Craig but I would say he is one of My favorite Bonds. Really gets his hands dirty.,positive
"The best Bond movie I have seen, if only for the fact that it was almost believeable!! Also, Eva Green was very good in this movie!!",positive
Daniel Craig is the best bond without a doubt! Serious hotness!!,positive
"James Bond gets a hefty whack in the testes in Casino Royale, both literally and figuratively. The 21st installment of the world's longest-running movie series strips away the gadgetry to focus on action and character, introducing a younger, tougher James Bond (Daniel Craig) struggling to complete his first major mission. The target is terrorist banker Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), whom our hero must defeat in a high stakes poker game at the swanky Casino Royale in Montenegro. First things first: Daniel Craig is not a good Bond. He's a great Bond. Specifically, he is 007 as conceived by Ian Fleming - a professional killing machine, a charming, cold-hearted patriot with a taste for luxury. Craig is the first actor to really nail 007's defining characteristic: he's an absolute swine. Following his example, Martin Campbell's film hits the ground running with a breathless chase through a building site, a sequence so impressive that the rest of the action struggles to trump it. Bond takes a tremendous battering throughout the movie. He's beaten senseless, thrown off ledges, poisoned and tortured. Even his withered heart takes a whupping when he falls for slinky treasury agent Vesper Lynd (Eva Green). It's all thrilling stuff, closer in tone to The Bourne Identity than the camp quippery of old-school Bond. ""CRAIG'S THE FIRST ACTOR TO REALLY NAIL 007"" There are a few problems. 144 minutes is dangerously long for an action flick, and audiences may be restless during the protracted romantic interludes. You could drive an Aston Martin through the holes in the plot, and Chris Cornell's theme tune is an embarassment. But these are small niggles. Casino Royale is a 1,000 watt jolt to the heart of a flagging franchise, bringing Bond kicking - and frequently screaming - back to life.",positive
"wonderful spy movie but didn't feel like Bond flick, not enough one-liners and gadgets",negative
One of the best Bonds ever! Plus even one of the best actions films for a while...,positive
A good Bond film. Bloody hell.Ripped off the bourne films mind.,negative
maganda dw ito eh...,negative
"Not as good as the old bond, hes not cool enough!",negative
"I'll give the movie points for being more action-oriented and fast-paced than the rest of the Bond series. I will NOT recommend this film for its egregious attempt to rewrite the original of this episode, replacing Baccarat with Texas Hold-'em and retaining Judi Dench as M rather than sticking to canon when M was a man before Bond became 007.",negative
Fantastic! I saw it twice in the first three days.,positive
"I think this might be my favourite Bond movie so far, though I haven't really seen enough to judge. Daniel Craig is a great Bond, and he brings a kind of psychological realism to the role which is new to the series, I think. The pacing is a bit wonky, with a flash-bang opening and rather leisurely conclusion, but I never found my mind wandering (as I have in other 2.5 hour movies). I'm really looking forward to ""A Quantum of Solace"".",positive
"I'm not a huge james bond fan, so this movie was sort of boring...",negative
An insult to Bond films. Daniel Craig should be ashamed.,negative
Craig's the best... and the free running (parkour) scene is great.,negative
not a fan of james bond,negative
- Vodka-martini. - Shaken or stirred? - Do I look like I give a damn?,positive
"One of the best bond movies yet. Well acted, not overdone on the action.",positive
Bond is back in a big bad way.,negative
one of the best to date,positive
"The format of the movie may have been a bit long-winded, but Daniel Craig as James Bond more than makes up for the fact.",positive
"Nogenlunde actionfilm, men det har ikke meget med James Bond at gÃ¸re hvis i spÃ¸rger mig, nu har jeg aldrig vÃ¦ret den store James Bond fan, sÃ¥ det er vel et plus. Eller er det. NÃ¥r jeg tÃ¦nker James Bond tÃ¦nker jeg gadgets, farlige og frÃ¦kke damer, unique superskurke men jeg syntes ikke at Casino Royale indeholder nogle af delene. Filmen er ogsÃ¥ 40 min for lang og det hele bliver lidt ligegyldigt til sidst. Daniel Craig gÃ¸r det dog udemÃ¦rket, men det er godt nok en anden James Bond figur end vi er vandt til - det er selvfÃ¸lgelig et plus...jeg ved ikke, filmen virkede ikke rigtig pÃ¥ mig.",negative
James Bond is a great character that has been turned into a cliche. This movie brings out the character again and it does it well. Great action and great drama too. The best Bond film in 40 years.,positive
"Excellent! A bond to rival the early films. Dark, selfish and brutal, but the charm is still there.",positive
"Completely surprised, not bad at all, actually!",positive
it is so kl and the gun fights and all the chases and all of the.... well all of it,positive
"The best ACTION-bond since Connery, period.",positive
"I had my doubts about Daniel Craig, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised.",positive
Much better than any of the the Pierce Brosnan Bond movies. Daniel Craig and Timothy Dalton are my favorite Bonds.,positive
"Fun! A classic Bond film, witty and yet had an edge to it. Less gadgety than other Bond flicks, but all the better for it. A twis here and there was good to see!",negative
He spent a little too much time at the poker table. That's the only fault I found with it.,positive
This is one of the best bond movies ever made!,positive
Very surprising - but Daniel Craig delivered the best Bond performance in YEARS! Just loved it!,positive
if all the other bond movies were this entertaining i'd actually give them a shot.,negative
actually a better Bond than most. I was impressed.,negative
"Pierce Brosnan did suck, this guy is the real deal!",positive
Best bond film yet. Daniel Craig does a flawless job of recreating the vintage bond. 5/5,positive
great movie overall.,positive
"Forget what the Craig haters say, he's definitely up to the billing as James Bond.",positive
"The best Bond since Goldeneye. The most serious bond since Goldfinger. The book though is way better (as with all the Bonds) but as far as the movies go, this is one of the strongest.",negative
"Brilliant, rescues bond from kitsch cheesy death. Best bond in ages..",positive
Daniel Craig is HOT and my FAVORITE Bond!,positive
"It's a new character. It's not James Bond. They should admit it, and move on.",negative
"This film is very good. it contains a nice car, and alot of action. ts such a cool film.",positive
"Welcome to the 21st century Mr Bond. A movie that maintains all the Bond mystery and intrigue, but mixes in a little class and sophistication. Daniel Craig definately will have won some new Bond fans and reinvigorated some others. Me, I'll always be a fan no matter what, but I'm really hoping Craig will star in at least another episode.",positive
Better than the last few Bonds.,negative
"one of my favorite bond films, craig makes a great bond and the humanity of the film returned.... no more invincible bond from the brosnan days!",negative
Why did they have to crash the car,negative
"This movie was a little slow for me. The chase scene at the beginning of the film is awesome but it kind of goes south from there. If you like Daniel Craig, watch Layer Cake...a much better film.",negative
Not a james bond film fan at all but i did enjoy this film daniel craig is lovely mmmmmm,positive
"For someone who hates Bond anything, I actually was quite impressed with this movie. Action was incredible and really unique. Daniel Craig was phenomenal, and Eva Green very sexy.",negative
Happy to see a 'serious' Bond again. Love the human touches and the storyline. Daniel Craig is the real deal.,positive
Thanks to Jason Bourne we got a Bond that fits in this world. A cool yet brutal Bond. The Bond I've wanted my entire life. Thank you Jason Bourne...thank you.,positive
"I'm not a Bond fan, and I blame it on Pierce Brosnan. I can't stand to watch him try to be a secret agent and I don't know why. Enter: Daniel Craig. This guy sells James Bond to me in a way that's never been done. Plus, Texas Hold'em is just one of the greatest games ever!",positive
"I was a skeptic about this one.At the outset Craig did not seem like Bond material.But...I was won over.It was not just because Craig is worthy eye candy but because he was good in his role as Bond.I actually liked the awkward, stumbling Bond in this instalment.It made him human, which I think is the appeal of this Bond film.It doesnt let down the regular Bond fan either, you do get the male chauvanism, the one-liners, the gadgets,fancy cars and of course the beautiful women.All in all a good movie.",positive
Pierce Brosnan should never have been replaced to begin with.,negative
Probably the best bond movie I've seen.,positive
Mare meva i pensar k no veia a akest bon home al servei de sa majestat... Demano perdo!!! Sean Conery ha trobat succesor a la corona 40 anys despres.,positive
"Great movie through and through, solid script, amazing action. Although it is what a lot of Bond fans liked, it was good to see a Bond movie without all the cheesey-ness.",positive
yummy great film i love his car,positive
"Very exciting Bond movie. So I liked it, but I feel like the script was kinda confusing and Bond had lost all his charm and elegance.",negative
Great performance by Craig - my new 007 hero!,positive
"Great script, great debut by Craig, and it's overall a good movie. But I don't know...it's missing that Bond appeal. Where's Q and Moneypenny?",negative
"I very reluctantly watched this, but it wasn't bad.",negative
Very good Bond - Daniel Craig is the best 007 since Roger Moore,positive
Kicked some ass. Hell Yea. Last movie before boot camp for me,positive
Best James Bond (sorry Connery),positive
One of the best James Bond's,positive
the new bond is second only to the original...Sean connery,positive
"Won me over, ws a Pierce Brosnan fan, best Bond and Bond film made. All action no gadgets and very frew cheesy lines. Eva Green best looking Bond girl ever!",positive
"It seemed impossible to me that this movie or this Bond could be any good at all. Surprise, fucker!",negative
"See James Bond. See new younger James Bond. See new younger James Bond kick ass... Go Bond, Go!",positive
longer than it needs to be but def worth seeing.,positive
"The best Bond film to date. It shows a darker, more realistic 007 than any other film.",positive
"Possibly the best Bond movie since From Russia with Love, and likely the best opening sequence in the series. This is 007's version of Batman Begins: the evolution of a formula that's run its course. New Bond is put through the ringer in a modernized magnum opus of all the character represents. It's great seeing a grittier, sloppier Bond who, no offense to previous actors, looks like he can legitimately kick ass.",positive
"The first Bond who looked like he could really do all the physical stuff. Not saying he was the best Bond, however!",negative
"I am loving the new bond look, it definitely felt as though he were a younger bond...",positive
A new Bond baby and this one is more into ass kicking then previous ones were.,negative
"Pretty good. I like the fact that they brought back the idea that he's an eccelent card player, stayed true to the character from the book (as far as just liking his berreta and not all the high tech stuff). Also, the set up the idea as far as why he's a womeniser.",negative
"Seemed like a great film, no doubt. But just didn't feel like a Bond film. Sorry.",positive
The best Bond so far.,positive
An Action Packed Thriller,positive
Reinvention at it's very best!,positive
"Bond is back to kicking ass, not using hundreds of gadgets.",positive
"what made the original James Bond movies good was the gadgets, there are none! actor has a head that looks like a peanut balancing on a melon, and James Bond now, appears to be sub human, being unable to judge a death defying leap properly, most normal people could because of the adrenaline in that situation, but not him. a bad excuse for a James Bond movie. (cashing in)",negative
Kerranki Bond on inhimillinen mokaaja. Suosittelen.,positive
"'The name is Bond, James Bond'. Een van de beste bondfilms boordevol actie! Met o.a. Daniel Graq",positive
Daniel Craig did a good job as the new Bond.,negative
"Honestly, I just don't like Bond films. And if so freakin' much is riding on this poker game, can't they figure out some gadget to cheat? And I could have lived a long time without seeing that torture scene. Anways, Daniel Craig is awesome as Bond, I will give the film that.",negative
"a new bond, and a new type of bond movie, very good",negative
Best James Bond ever,positive
"007, Blonde...James Blonde. Funny how there was an uproar when Daniel Craig was cast. ""He has blonde hair! Bond isn't blonde!"" But he nailed it, now all those naysayers are calling him the best ever. Fickle. Anyhoo, I loved it. I'm a James Bond freak and think that this movie got it right. We were subjected to campy, over the top Bond ever since Roger Moore donned the tie. Not knocking those ones, but it's nice to have a Bond grounded in reality. Nice. Connery will be proud.",positive
"Bond is back, and this time he really is BACK! Gone are the endless fannying about with gadgets, flirting with the predictable Miss Moneypenny & awful CGI special effects and in comes some good live action sequences and a harder Bond. Dalton is my favorite 007 for his tougher grittier portrayal of MI6's top dog and Daniel Craig is closer to that than he is to any of the other 4 actors. So a better plot, better stunts and a general more modern day action film there are some constants that have been kept which please me. Firstly he's still got that womanizing trait, secondly, there are still the fast cars & thirdly, the wonderful Dame Judi Dench reprises her role as M. It's no Batman Begins but a bloody good reboot still.",positive
The only james bond film i liked. Brand James Bond usually sucks with tons of cheese and cliches. Like in most of his films Daniel Craig runs the show.,positive
"First time thought it was excellent. Then i had to learn the Chris Cornell song for an exam and grew to love the song and made me wnt to watch the film again. Now i think the film is incredible! A great come back to form for Bond, great plot and not too many gadgets like the last few Bond films (invisible car...what the f***!...real!).",positive
d new James Bond. less gadgets=more physical action.,negative
the best james bond in AGES and actually a good movie in its own right,positive
A good improvement and come back for Bond films from recent times.,positive
best bond actor.. w/o a doubt. finally we have a bondmovie liberated from the american hollywood atmosphere. Bond's brittish so keep the movie brittish!!,positive
"a grittier, more realistic 007 movie!",positive
"Amazing. Caught me totally off-guard with its combination of gritty, clever yet smooth delivery of a Bond movie I can finally believe.",positive
"Daniel Craig is superb as James Bond. He portrays Bond exactly as he should be--charming, sophisticated, chillingly ruthless. Eva Green is equally superb. A realistic Bond film.",positive
this guy is the WORST Bond EVEEEER,negative
Mi favorita de James Bond... aunque claro me sigo quedando con Sean Connery,positive
A new Bond character but same old Bond!,positive
"A great action film, a horrible Bond film.",negative
"I love Connery as Bond, and Daniel Craig might be the heir to Connery's throne. Smooth, cool, tough and totally hot. Oh yeah, the rest of the movie is good too.",positive
This is easily one of my favorite movies of all time...,positive
The best Bond film there is. Action packed and very stylish.,positive
"For my money, pretty much the best Bond Film ever. And was one of the most enjoyable films of 2006. Daniel Craig may in fact end up being the Best Bond ever.",positive
Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute!!!,positive
"bonds back. only thing i didn't like about the new character is his drink. (has to be shaken, not stirred). he drinks a martini with a twist!",negative
"This Bond has some of the best action sequences and the central poker game is great to watch. However, the time he spends with Vesper in the middle of the film drags somewhat and tarnishes an otherwise great plot.",negative
"Darkest Bond movie yet. He's so cool, he borders on psychotic.",positive
"Possibly one of the best Bond films, and it's just a good movie on it's own.",positive
Excellent James Bond movie. Daniel Craig did an excellent playing James Bond. Excellent storyline and great action.,positive
"very good, It's the first I watch and it encourages me to see more.",positive
now I can tell the world that you scratched my balls,positive
"Crap plot but believable Bond. Over-hyped really...the 'torture' is just Bond getting hit in the balls a few times and the best chase in the film is on foot and at the start. Daniel Craig turns in a good performance as Bond, nice to see him being less smug (the character and the actor haha) than usual, Bond is more convincing as a working-class guy in this rather than the usual old-boys-network type toff who'd get rumbled more often. Overall though, I was disappointed by this, but it does make me more optimistic for the next one, as long as the plot is better than this (basically, poker game, stitch-ups,few people die)",negative
"Definitely one of the best James Bond movies ever made. Daniel Craig was a great Bond, far better than Pierce Brosnan!",positive
One of the best bond movies.,positive
James Bond finatic durr,positive
Daniel Craig is so yum!,negative
The Best Bond!! Simple as that,positive
"Not bad, I had never seen any of the bond movies, I think this one was a good one to start with.",negative
Cracking to see Bond back on form - and looking good in the bathers too!,positive
James Bond is such a pimp...,positive
"Good bond movie, if you are into that kind of thing",positive
Daniel Craig makes an excellent 007. I am a Sean Connery fan from way back & he was always 007 to me. Daniel really does the role justice though.,positive
brought some class back into the series,positive
"Just another James Bond movie, (I'm more of a war movie fan) which may or may not be a good thing.",negative
Best Bond movie I have seen in a long time.. The series was starting to run low on action scenes - til now :),positive
"Love Daniel Craig...people thought he would be terrible, but he really breathes life into Bond again. Very slick, sexy movie...",positive
"This is my favorite Bond movie. It's stunning visually, fun to watch, and breaks my heart every time. Even if you don't like Bond movies, definitely see this one.",positive
I was blown away with Daniel Craig. I like him as much as Sean Connery. After the last 2 Bond movies they needed a grittier actor to come in a step it up. I look forward to the next film,positive
"Definitely the best Bond movie in years! Daniel Craig brings a ruggedness to the role of 007. Portraying Bond as less the ladies man and more a cold blooded killer. Played close to the vest, it shows Bond as more human than super man. There are no overblown action sequences, no high tech gadgets, everything has a very organic 60's feel to. It brings Bond back to it's roots. Here's hoping the trend continues.",positive
danial was the hottest James Bond that I have seenout of all ?4?,positive
This is how James Bond was meant to be!,positive
One of my all time favorite movies!! Can't believe I missed it in the theater...,positive
"One of the better James Bond movies. More humane, more vulnerable, more realistic to Fleming's vision.",positive
"After the diabolically awful 'Die Another Day' the Bond franchise has received a rather fantastic re-invigoration with this latest adventure. The first hour makes for absolutely stimulating action cinema, Craig's Bond initially comes across as a cold eyed cyborg, an unstoppable machine traipsing through the film destroying everything in sight with no regard for human emotion, his early Miami airport showdown with the equally dead eyed terrorist makes for a Cameron esq battle between a pair of Terminator's, and all the while this relentless action is set to a super cool Michael Mann style aesthetic. The films second half can't quite keep pace and gives in to incorporate more traditional Bond cliches, and the protracted ending risks becoming a bit of a convoluted mess, but still Casino Royale remains consistently more engaging than any of the recent outlandish Brosnan efforts, and the series can consider itself straight back into my good books.",positive
"Finally, a good bond movie. Craig does amazingly well.",positive
The only James Bond movie I really liked,negative
007 movies r the greatest,positive
one of the best bond ever.,positive
"I've been a die-hard ""only Connery is Bond"" until this movie. Daniel Craig is riveting as an unrefined Bond, James Bond.",positive
"i think this is the best bond film i've ever seen, and i've seen them all. seriously, it was so good that i was about to cry towards the end, even though i knew what was going to happen, since i read the book. very successful reboot of the franchise, and i'm totally looking foward to the next film, quantum of solace.",positive
"James Bond had died on his arse as far as I was concerned but I forced myself to watch this and was very pleasantly surprised, the plot was the usual mess but Craig transcended this with a mesmerising performance",positive
Was ok. Seemed a bit conservative compared to previous Bond flicks.,negative
Something new for a Bond fan from way back! Great! I think he is going to be an awesome Bond!,positive
A good direction for the new Bond to go.,positive
My favourite Bond film so far!,positive
I didnt like this... mind you I could barely stand the originals this is much worse though.,negative
Love Daniel Craig as Bond,positive
Daniel Craig is the best bond ever! Can't wait for the next installment.,positive
best bond since roger moore,positive
one of the best bond films and craig is the best bond after connery...daniel craig is as close to bond as the bond portrayed in the novels (which i've been reading lately)...this is bond that women want to be with and men want to be!,positive
The best Bond movie ever.,positive
coolest part was the POKER!,negative
"Possibly the best bond ever made. Has it's problems, but so much of it just rocks so hard",positive
made me like bond again,positive
i liked this. i didnt think i would but i really did!,negative
james bond like he should be. Dark and intelligent.,negative
"This is how a BOND should act. Vicious, with the look of evil that Daniel Craig had. I only like a few of the BOND series, and this is the one I like the most",positive
"Once i realized the movie was all about the poker game, i liked it. could have been a better ening though...",negative
Favorite James Bond of the last decade! Loves Pierce but not as much!,positive
"Action good, not very racy for Bond flick",negative
absolutely the best Bond movie ever made. Daniel Craig is great as 007. He shows that mr Bond has brains as well as good looks.,positive
I know I'm probably in the minority here but it just didn't work for me.,negative
Much better than I expected it to be - Daniel Craig is a refreshing Bond,negative
very good ...but still they shouldnt have gotten rid of peirce..,positive
Return to form for James Bond.,negative
Greatest chase scene ever.,negative
This Bond is Kick Ass. A very dark movie. This Bond still gets the girl but also kills just about everyone,positive
"The BEST bond film I have ever seen. Daniel Craig was a shockingly good Bond. I've seen all of them and have read some of the actual books...in my opinion, Craig does the character more justice than Sean Connery, Roger Moore, or Pierce Brosnan every did.",positive
The best Bond Movie of all time! Daniel Craig makes all of the other Bonds look like little girls. His rugged yet charming physique is perfect for the 007 character.,positive
This movie SUCKED!!! Easily the WORST Bond film EVER!!! The story was weak. There was not enough action. James was nearly killed twice. The story was difficult to follow. There were NO gadgets. There was NO Q. This movie SUCKED!!!,negative
Really good. I liked the less gadgety Bond.,positive
The best Bond! So dangerous!,positive
Really cool - can't wait until the next one!,positive
I'm pathetic when it comes to going to the movies! This was the last one I saw!,positive
"Daniel Craig is great, no... even better than Connery. Darker is better.",positive
"The most unique Bond film in the 007 series. Not too many fancy gadgets nor breathtaking action stunts, but an unusual take into Bond's more common human side. Daniel Craig made Bond more real and deep. Eva Green's portrayal of the Bond girl is also by far the most classy, complex, and beautiful of all.",positive
Cooler than Frosty's deodorant.,positive
The best of the Bonds mainly cause it seperates itself from the others and finds its own identity,positive
"poxa, decepção... e juro que eu me esforcei pra aceitar o Daniel Craig como 007, mas não dá. e a história também não colaborou... 1 hora de jogo de pôquer (= tédio sem fim, já que eu não entendo nada do jogo) e nos 30 minutos finais resolvem enfiar cinquenta mil novos personagens na história, pra que faça sentido. tudo muito jogado, sem grandes explicações :/",negative
Melkein tÃ¤ydellinen bond-elokuva.,positive
aaaaaaaaaaaaamazing.,positive
Best James Bond movie ever! Finally a James Bonds who's tough and behaves like a spy. Most of the other James Bond movies simply portray 007 as nothing more than a womanizer.,positive
"good bond film, but not really a bond-ish storyline",positive
"Outstanding debut for Daniel Craig. Ranks as one of the top 3 Bond films ever. Unfortunately, I think it indulges in pop culture references a bit too much, especially texas hold'em poker, which may limit its longevity. Still, the best Bond film in at least 30 years. Craig is second only to Connery, and may surpass him given time.",positive
Finally some depth. Amazing film all around,positive
Craig is a classic. He's got style and brings class to the Bond Franchise,positive
the right james bond.,positive
"A great film, let alone Bond film. Danny-boy proved to be the best Bond in a long time and now the character is headed in a direction thats really interesting. The film itself was well paced and struck a great tone with hard, rough action and engaging dialogue. Whats also woth mentioning is that this is one of few films that actually re-affirms masculinity - Boy power!",positive
The best Bond movie in recent memory.,positive
"Eva Green was the most dissapointing aspect of this film. I've noticed lots of the ladies liked this for Daniel Craig but don't know many guys who liked this film in general. It seemed incredibly long, especially the card playing scenes. I loved the action sequences, from the free-running chase to the airport runway spectacle.",negative
Bond...is...BLOND?! Plus the movie should have ended LONG before it did.,negative
"This film is good on so many levels that it'll take forever to list them all, but one obvious (and often said) plus, is that Daniel Craig is a great choice for James Bond.",positive
not as good as i thought,negative
madly in lurve wif this mooovie!! xx,negative
Probably saved the franchise but can they keep it up and in the right direction? Bring on Quantum of Solace.,positive
Great new bond. Craig has resurrected 007. Can he compete with the Bourne franchise?,negative
"One of the best of the more recent bonds, Pierce B should be ashamed of the bonds he played before this one.",positive
Best Bond in a while.,positive
Bond is Back and Better than Ever in those Trunks!! :),positive
The best James Bond movie to date,positive
"I hesitate to say the best ever but it's not far off. It's got it all. Great opening, girl, scenery, torture. And what an ending!! Daniel Craig for me is a perfect choice for Bond, suave and ruthless. Another couple to prove himself and he will be up there with Connery.",positive
"Best Bond flick since... well, since I was born.",positive
izlememe gÄ±bÄ± bÄ±r hata yapan varsa Ä±zleseÄ±n tam bÃÂ± actÄ±oon fÄ±lm,negative
"Noen mener detter er en poker film, forkledd av navnet James Bond. er litt enig, men det er jo fortsatt en bra film.",positive
over rated! this is not what bond should be!,negative
"I adore Daniel Craig, best bond movie ever",positive
I'm not a Bond fan... this has done a lot to resurrect a dying franchise... unfortunately others have done it better (Lyman and Cameron spring to mind... even Besson).,negative
ohh!! bond falls in love.....hmm,negative
Greatest Bond ever!!!,positive
Daniel Craig's no Sean Connery...yet. A lot of potential.,positive
i'm not a bond fan. i watched this movie with a friend thinking it would be like all the other bond films i tried to watch and just couldn't stomach. But this one rocked.,positive
I like Daniel Craig as Bond...it's believable,positive
BEST JAMES BOND MOVIE EVER!!! can't wait fo the new one.,positive
Better than any other film,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond by far.,positive
Pretty good. Daniel Craig is a solid Bond.,positive
Bond finally done right!,positive
I fell in love with Daniel Craig watching this movie,negative
"It's the only Bond movie that's genuinely good, it doesn't fee like a Bond movie at all. Bravo.",positive
Daniel Craig makes a hot Bond!,positive
A very good James Bond movie. Lots of action. Only complaint is that the guy who played Bond seemed a little old for the part.,negative
the few action movies i do watch that makes me want to watch it over and over! it was amazing!,positive
"I thought - take Pierce away? He's not old! He's a suave, wonderful sounding James Bond! Don't do it! So, I rather reluctantly went to Casino Royale - well, the first time anyway. Thank you so much for taking a chance and making this series now so wonderfully refreshing! And Daniel Craig is the ultimate Bond!! Honestly, I watch all of the other Bond flicks now and think, ""why oh why didn't they get down to the nitty gritty sooner?!""",positive
James Bond - Daniel Craig - YES!!!,positive
That was so fun and the action and torture scenes were spot-on realistic!,positive
Really good bond movie,positive
sÃ¼per eskisini unuttum,positive
"Bond has been known to keep his cool, to play the ladies, and to go out with a bang. Let's throw all of that out the window, and go back to day one, where Bond was... not too far from a human being.",positive
He's Soooooooooooooo Hot I want his babies,positive
Daniel Craig coming out of the sea - say no more!,positive
"Very Good movie,Thought Daniel Craig gave a great performance and showed a lot of Bond moves etc.He needs to work on his wit/sense of humour to finally fill the role.",positive
Simply The Greatest Bond Film Ever!!,positive
"I really felt connected to Daniel Craig's James Bond, which no other actor has done. It's really interesting to see why he turned out to be such a male chauvinist pig.",positive
Return of the ass kicker Bond.,positive
A great movie on its own but it fell short of my expectations for a BOND film,positive
"Overrated. If I wanted to watch an hour long scene of people playing poker I'd watch celeb Texas Hold'em. Amazing opening scene though, cool chase.",negative
"Stars the hottest man alive, I luv Daniel Craig, my fave movie eva",positive
Ummm totally worth it just to see Daniel Craig! Can I get an Amen?!,positive
Craig may become one of the best 007 ever.,positive
ACTION PACKED MOVIE BUT THE ACTOR LACK CHARISMA,positive
"Well, I thought it was better than the entire bond series :p",positive
"An enjoyable film, however has a highly boring and disappointing middle sectiono",negative
"A much better Bond effort than Brosnan, who should've been history after Goldeneye.",positive
One of the top 5 bond flicks.,positive
best james bond ever dont care what any ones says truely a great movie,positive
"I didn't honestly believed Daniel Craig would be able to fill Pierce Brosnan shoes but he did a damned good job at it. Very nice pic, much better than anticipated.",positive
"An interesting portrayal of the young and unpolished Bond, more foolhardy, emotional and vulnerable. A little too lengthy though.",negative
"Liked it, but it felt like it had lost a bit of Bond. If I want Bourne, I'll watch Bourne. And unbelievably violent for a 12. The torture scene is fucking harsh.",negative
Best Bond flick in a while.,positive
"This is such a drag. Sure the chase scene is cool, but the rest of the movie is so slow. It feels like your watching poker on cable TV. One of the worse Bond movies I have watched",negative
Casino Royale was a good James Bond movie. It kind of dragged on a bit but Daniel Craig is gorgeous.,negative
"It's good. I won't deny that. And I liked the human touch they put on Bond. But for a film that tried to put a fresh spin on Bond we still have a camp villain, bad jokes and stereotypical views of nations.",negative
Intense and riveting Bond flick. I loved the action sequences and appreciate the new Bond. Go Daniel!,positive
The best Bond film. Even better than the Connery ones.,positive
love bond and this didn't let me down,positive
"Didn't liked Daniel Craig's acting so much, but the plot was great.",negative
omg!!! MMMM... great movie!,positive
Spoiled only by the sloppy bits. Apart from that a lot more gritty than the rest.,positive
"Cars and gadgets, got to be good",negative
I wanna car just like that :) very slick movie !!,positive
In my opinion Craig is the best bond! This is by far the best Bond film in ages!,positive
Didn't like it the first time I watched it. but after watching it a couple more times it's growing on me,negative
The best bond since Connery,positive
"A fascinating return of Bond which uncovers all of the truths, deceptions, and murders of the once 'cold' Bond. The way Bond should be.",positive
A rather different James Bond which is more like a human and not bullet proof... good re-establishment and more convincing of what a spy would be like...,positive
Whoever said that Daniel Craig could never play Bond can suck it. He recreated the role in one of the best installments of the entire series.,positive
Nah by far the best... Gotta move with the times like nah i mean!,positive
Have to admit he makes a pretty good Bond.,positive
Hands down my favorite Bond movie. Daniel Craig does a superb job as the new Bond!,positive
"New twist on Bond. A lot edgier, and it goes back to that British feel a la Sean Connery.",positive
The longest James Bond movie ever,negative
"Captivating and exhilarating, this is easily one of, if not, the best Bond films made. A well crafted film with a superb performance by Craig in his Bond debut. The pace never lets down: every moment is fraught with danger and suspense.",positive
it's bond...he's sexy and complex...just how i like him!!,positive
This was a Bond film? Might want a script revision.,negative
i liked Pierce more but this one was sick,positive
"I thought this would be better. Now I am officially a Bourne fan, and a Bond hater.",negative
"Arguablly the Best Bond yet! Forget all those pretty boys... they were good, but Daniel Craig kicks ASS!",positive
"Probably the 2nd best Bond movie ever. My mom who was a huge Bond enthusiast back in the day, didn't dig Craig or the style of Bond he portrays but holy geez it is the best character development of James Bond ever done in a film. It makes Bond so much more complex, showing where he was at his beginning. Incredible, incredible movie.",positive
"This is the Best Bond Movie Ever! I'm a huge fan of all the Pierce Brosnan movies, but this one makes me almost forget they ever existed! Here is a Bond that you can imagine is actually doing all the things that he was filmed doing and looking as sexy and hot as wanted him to be. Please more and more and more!",positive
"A great Bonde film. I don't care what anyone else says, Daniel Craig is one the best Bondes ever right up there with Sean Connery. See this Bonde film.Also one of the best sountracks in a Bonde fim.",positive
"I never liked James Bond movies until this one. He's not some pompus prick, just a smooth badass. Very good.",positive
"Good remake, Craig could make a very good bond",positive
No se si fue mal doblaje pero que mierda ni siquiera entendi que hacia alli james bond,negative
Great Bond flick. This guy is no pansy like the last few.,positive
Right forced to see this and it wasn't too bad,negative
Den absolut bÃ¤sta bondfilmen hittills. Dock utan en enda snygging att vila Ã¶gonen + att den snygga tjejen dÃ¶r efter 3 minuter... DÃ¥ Ã¤r en film GRYM om den hÃ¥ller Ã¤ndÃ¥!,positive
"I am not a big James Bond fan at all. I have seen a lot of them and only really liked this one. Maybe it is the 'international' Bond that I liked the best. At first I was enthralled by Daniel Craig being Bond, then I liked him in the movie. I typcially didn't like how they have infinate budget to blow up a hundred-something-thousand car in a matte of moments.",positive
Daniel Craig will never be as cool as Sean Connery. Ever.,positive
i loved it was the best movie ever,positive
Much more human Bond than we've seen before. Very obvious influence in style from the Bourne Trilogy. And no hokey gadgets like laser beam watches or missle racks in cars.,positive
"Plus Ã©tonnant que je ne l'eue cru, Daniel Craig a beaucoup de sexappeal!!!",positive
Takes The Bond Movies Kicking and Screaming Into the 21st century Daniel Craig oozes class and style,positive
"Not only the BEST BOND movie EVER, but just one fine film all the way around. It's got incredible action sequences, wonderful story arcs, characters that have depth and humanity and best of all, you believe it all. Bond bleeds, he gets hurt, both physically and emotionally, and he makes mistakes along the way. It made my Top 5 list as soon as the credits rolled. I can't wait for the sequel, but I don't know how they are going to top it!",positive
"I doubted Daniel Craig as Bond at first...turns out he's the best one, even better than Connery.",positive
Just Awesome! Don't miss it!,positive
Up in the Top 5 Bond flicks for sure. This coming from a self confessed Bondaphile.,positive
Je suis un fan inconditionnel de James Bond. Je les ai tous et donc je les ai tous vu. Je ne me lasse pas de les revoir et le dernier est vraiment exceptionnel avec un grand Daniel Craig dans le rÃ´le de 007.,positive

I was thoroughly satisfied.,positive
"The only James Bond movie I have really liked - not entirely happy with the way everything turned out, but it was realistic for Bond, I think.",positive
"not my favorite Bond movie, I have to say.",negative
"I think it was overhyped, but still much better than most of the other Bond's.",negative
"This Bond movie saved the franchise from it's recent glitzy special effects garbage by bringing Bond back to basics, the way it should be.",positive
Daniel Craig is a badass 007,positive
"""i've got an itch"" classic",positive
"Daniel Craig is a good pick for a James Bond. Love the choice of cars for this flick, not over the top scenes. Great cinematography!",positive
it was ok but it needed more action. too much siting aroung playing cards,negative
"Brilliant, Simply Brilliant. This brought into the 21st centry Bond has been a long time coming, Daniel Criag has brought to the table a flawless Bond and has shown us where it all begun with top marks. Daniel is able to show us why Bond is a Cold Hearted Bastard/Get the job done at all cost kind of guy and still slip up with the emtion of losing a Good Women. I'm sure Daniel will be placed into this role for a long time. Brilliantly played Daniel Craig, Just Brilliant!!",positive
Bond is back: animal und mysogynist! Minus point for the shallow love story and the annoying product placement,negative
Excellent Bond Movie,positive
"Credible reboot of the long running franchise starring Daniel Craig that actually goes back to the original Ian Fleming source material and makes the Pierce Brosnan era welcome history. The film is more serious (no Q or Moneypenny characters, less gadget emphasis) but still has breathtaking action sequences that are less CGI and an improvement on its predecessor Die Another Day. I remember when Craig was first cast the furore it caused amongst some Bond fans. They need not have worried to be fair. Many memorable scenes from the novel are faithfully adapted but the card game in the Casino Royale is changed to Texas Hold'em Poker.",positive
Well hello Mr Craig!!! Best Bond film I think (from the new era anyway). Great fight/chase sequences...,negative
4 stars for me very very very very very very x1000 Good :D,positive
Totally riveting. Totally enjoyable. Daniel Craig also gets completely nude. What more could you want from a Bond movie?,positive
the new bond is a badass bond.,positive
"I do not care what you say. Daniel Craig is an AMAZING Bond, perfect for the job and this was, by far, the BEST BOND. Can't wait for the next one.",positive
the film that made me run to the cinima!,positive
"The best james bond movie since Goldeneye, Awesome!! Daniel Craig pulls it off, and this movie is just packed full of awesome action!",positive
"""It was great but it wasn't really a bond film."" Oh people please get over yourselves. This was great for any film.",positive
I watched this 3 times at the cinema then pre-ordered the dvd and watched that a few times too. Daniel Craig did an excellent job as Bond cant wait for the next one,positive
"The best of all ""Bond's"" movies for me ...",positive
"Depending how you like your bond movies, this is either brilliant or damn good.",positive

"Hey wait, this one is different!",negative
went beyond my expectations,negative
"Gritty, raw, a great adaptation of Fleming's work, none of the corny raised eyebrow cliche'd lines until the fantastic delivery of the ""Bond....James Bond"" as the final line. Magnificent. Oh, and Daniel Craig...mmmmmmmmmm :)",positive
I just don't like the new guy.. I think they're trying to make him like Steve McQueen,negative
Probably the best James Bond movie I've seen so far.,positive
"Not just a great bond movie, a great movie period. Shame the whole thing is an ad for Sony stuff. The poker stuff isnt really that accurate to how the game would be played by Pro players, but oh well...",positive
Best bond of the modern era,positive
"This was the best James Bond movie to date, not because Daniel Craig was the best James Bond, but because the movie stayed true to the original character created by Ian Flemming. The gadgets that have been made popular by the movies were brought in in the 70's. I liked this one the most. It was a great re-invention of the series.",positive
"I don't do Bond. Just ask my husband. But this? This is what Bond was intended to be, all along.",positive
daniel craig is absolutely the best bond!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"There seems to be a pattern in the James Bond series that goes something like this: every so often, a really bad film is made, and then a really good film is made which gets the series back on track (until the next bad movie comes along). First, in 1979, we got ""Moonraker"", which was followed by ""For Your Eyes Only"". Then we got ""A View To A Kill"" followed by ""The Living Daylights"". And, in 2002, we got ""Die Another Day"" which would (eventually) be followed by ""Casino Royale"". Itâs not a stretch to say that ""Casino Royale"" is the best Bond film since ""Goldfinger. It seems that every time a new Bond film comes out, some critic always says ""It's the best Bond film ever"", or ""Itâs the best Bond film since the days of Sean Connery"". While some of these films have been very good (and some not so good), ""Casino Royale"" is the first film in a long time that really deserves that praise. Fans expecting a typical Bond film with lots of gadgets, stunning women and megalomaniacal villains will be surprised (but hopefully not disappointed). This is a very, very different kind of Bond film. While most Bond films are fantasy, bordering on science-fiction, ""Casino Royale"" is a realistic, very gritty adventure that returns Bond to his spy roots (an appropriate move seeing as how ""Casino Royale"" was the first Bond novel Fleming wrote). First off, we have the new Bond, Daniel Craig. Despite what some people might say about his height or hair color, Craig fits the role perfectly. His assignment is tricky because we are all used to seeing Bond as a seasoned, professional government agent. But in ""Casino Royale"", Bond has only recently been granted ""OO"" status, and is still new to the whole spy game. Because Bond hasn't developed his cold, sexist view toward women yet, we get to see a vulnerable Bond who falls in love with Vesper Lynd, and truly falls for her. Craig is completely believable whether he is romancing a woman, playing Texas Hold 'em, or engaging in a life or death struggle against the bad guys. As mentioned earlier, this is a much tougher and grittier Bond film than weâre used to. While Bond usually has to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the baddies, he also tends to have a lot of gadgets at his disposal. Not so in this movie. Here, Bond is tough, plain and simple. A perfect example of this new tougher Bond is the scene close to the beginning of the film where Bond chases a suspect through a construction zone. The chase involves Bond climbing over and through several buildings under construction, smashing right through a wall, and climbing to the top of a building frame hundreds of feet in the air to confront the villain. Rarely has Bond gotten so much exercise, and never before has an actor playing Bond been required to go through such an intense workout. While it is sad that Miss Monnypenny and Q aren't in the movie, M is back, once again played by the always reliable Judi Dench (thereby adding a sense of continuity to the Brosnan films). Eva Green is very good as Vesper Lynd, and there are some touching scenes between her and Bond. Mads Mikkelsen isnât a great Bond villain by any stretch, but at least heâs not trying to take over or destroy the world. The bottom line is that ""Casino Royale"" is one of the most original films in the whole series, and is superbly made. This is a film that can be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys good movies, not just Bond movies. At the beginning, Bond is a green, inexperienced agent, but by the end of the movie, he has become the cold, professional spy we all know and love, and one of the joys of the movie is seeing this transformation (though it is heartbreaking for Bond). Hopefully, Daniel Craig will continue on for many as years as ""Bondâ¦James Bond"".",positive
"He's a good Bond, maybe second only to Connery. I like the origin story and the chase scene at the beginning. I look forward to the next one.",positive
He might just be my hero...,positive
"As Bond films go, I like the charcter changes. The freeruning stunts were cool. Too much air time playing poker however. And sadly, no grand car chase scene",negative
"I'm not a James Bond fan. To me, the whole James Bond movie series is it's own sub-genre of the super spy movie genre, and all of the James Bond give in to the series own set of cliches every single movie. James Bond is just straight",positive
What all the Bond films should've been.,positive
"Thought I'd hate it as I couldn't picture DC as Bond now I can't imagine anyone else as Bond. Good to see some realistic fight scenes instead of the usual ""Judo Chop"" antics.",positive
"Finally, after a whole decade of Pierce Brosnan-slapstick Bond films, the real Fleming-Bond is back. One should read the novel first, before seeing it on DVD. Great adapted screenplay by Paul Haggis ('Crash', 'Million Dollar Baby', 'Quantum Of Solace'). The novel has been adapted faithfully, with respect of this new 21st century. Bond is a vulnerable, ruthless spy, who shows not so much respect towards girls. Bond is not just 'Bond', he's a human being too. He's also able to love and to feel emotions. But can those emotions be usefull for his work as MI6-spy 007? That's what the movie is about.",positive
"Daniel Craig, tight blue trunks, what more could you want?",positive
best bond film so far.,positive
At last a real life like killing machine Bond! Not some wise cracking old grand dad.,positive
Made me want to be a Bond girl!,positive
I stole Eva Green's face. Now I know what I'll look like if I drown.,positive
it was ok bourne is better,negative
"Surprisingly, I really like this movie. Very different from all the old Bond's movie. Daniel Craig is very masculine in this movie. Very lovable. The plot is interesting. I very much enjoyed it.",positive
"As a fan of 'James Bond', I hope that this is the last of the series.",negative
Brilliant Daniel Craig makes a great Bond,positive
"Certainly better than any of those nonsensical Pierce Brosnan films. Still, it did get a little confusing there toward the end.",negative
"Probably my favorite James Bond movie, and that is saying something.",positive
"A movie we expected more out of it, half stupid due and story could have been better. Picture quality was good.",negative
Online poker commercial with a bigger budget.,negative
The Best Bond since on her majesty's secret service and live and let die. I like Daniel Craig's portrayal.,positive
"A good Bond movie, with a fair amount of psychological development for the character, with explosive actions and suspense and a scenario fitting to Ian Fleming's hero ... but something is lacking, where is sarcastic humour... where is the flegmatic attitude ? Still not sure about what to think of it.",negative
"Anyone who likes spy movies and gamboling should definitely see this movie. Daniel Craig makes a great Bond. Beneath the smooth, classy exterior, he's a cold-hearted, badass killer.",positive
Not bad. I think Daniel Craig's a different style 007 than Sean Connery and stronger than Pierce Brosnan. But he wasn't quite as flashy either.,positive
"I'm not a big fan of the traditional dramatic direction they use, but it's James Bond, so they pull it off. The score is just great, and it's tons of fun seeing how he turned into who he is.",positive
2nd best James Bond.,positive
"a great bond film with the best bond since connery. Go Daniel Craig, keep being bond and making bad-ass movies!",positive
This James Bond makes me gladly forget about Pierce B.,positive
poker scenes r bloocks actions ok,negative
"Fini les gadgets inutiles et les mechants qui font peur a personne. Daniel Graig est le plus credible, avec Sean Connery, dans ce role d'agent secret. Enfin un tres bon James Bond !",positive
The best Bond and the best Bond film by far,positive
"Was skeptical before going to watch this, however, was thoroughly entertained. Is it actually a bond movie though?",negative
"Okay, where to begin... This guys is so ugly I have no idea why they cast him as Bond. He's not suave or charming, and he didn't pull it off. Second, this is a typical post-1988 ""We must re-invent Bond for the modern age"" flick. It's a good spy movie, but has nothing to do with Bond, and is actually full of very shallow modern annoyances, like reliance on cell phones etc. that distract from the Bond mystique. Lastly, ""Taxes Hold Em?"" Come one, you idiots. They don't play Hold Em in Bond movies, you retards.",negative
En stor skuffelse....MÃ¥ske fordi vi sad pÃ¥ 1. rÃ¦kke i biorgrafen og havde James nÃ¦rmest pÃ¥ skÃ¸det???,negative
Good for a big dose of adrenaline.,negative
Terrific Bond film. This franchise has been gagging for this one. This Bond is easily the closest (with the possible exception of George Lazenby)to the character in the books. Daniel Craig did a killer job. I hope the tone remains in place for the upcoming flicks. No more impossible gadgets please.,positive
Daniel Craig. Need I say more?,positive
"Blond, mais le meilleur james bond. Plus realiste que les Bonds habituels, ce film est d excellente facture, que ce soit au niveau scenario, bande son, realisation.",positive
"great , really good movie",positive
I adore Daniel Craig.. he's absolutely scrummy and brilliant in this film. Can't wait to see the next one. :0),positive
Daniel Craig - total surprise. What a Bond,positive
"Nicely done, but he should have folded that one hand near the beginning.",positive
Daniel Craig is the best bond ever. Good action.,positive
The most realistic Bond-movie...this Bond actually bleeds :op Daniel Craig is brilliant as Bond.,positive
"A very enjoyable film, Not what you would consider to be a typical 'Bond film' and the pace almost come to a stop during the romatic bit in the middle. The Finnale makes up for it especially the excellent Henchman (Rick English). Looking forward to the next film despite the poncy name",negative
"Gaping holes in the plot aside (and what did I expect? This is a Bond movie), this really is extraordinarily well done. Daniel Craig completely inhabits the role, making his predecessors seem like pretenders. Pierce who?",positive
Best Bond film ever.,positive
"Aside from lots of people becoming dead and women who show too much of themselves (the usual reasons why I'm not so fond of Bond), this movie had some pretty cool action--the construction site and airport sequences were my favorite.",negative
Very impressed. Would also like to know if it's possible to purchase the British Secret Service standard issue testicle protectors,positive
best james bond film yet,negative
up ther with the best(H),positive
Bond is back on form but I'm still not convinced by Craig's performance.,negative
"The Bond franchise has finally come up with a believeable Mr. Bond. Gone is the ridiculous superhero, replaced by a well trained super spy that is a lot more realistic than any previous Bond so far.",positive
One of the best Bond films in years if not the best. So fuck you Kevin.,positive
Best bond film EVER!,positive
Something's been missing for the past 21 bond films...oh yeah its Daniel Craig. Craig is bond. This is first class entertainment and a perfect depiction of who Bond truly is. Bond sucks...until now.,positive
"The best Bond movie, Daniel Craig is amazing.",positive
One of the best Bond movies to date.,positive
great action pack thriller,negative
Love this James Bond Movie. Truly right up there with any Sean Connery James Bond movie,positive

Dat's a Mean Bond..but still a good 1,positive
"The best Bond movie yet, in my humble opinion. Daniel Craig plays a flawless Bond.",positive
"Awesome, Daniel Craig being the best bond right after Sean Connery. Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen...oh yes.",positive
OMG he is so hot! Can't wait for the next one.,positive
"Daniel Craig is brilliant in this, I'm not usually a bond fan (other than Mr Connery) but this was brilliant.",positive
dont know what to think of this,negative
"There is a new James Bond and his name is Daniel Craig. A much more serious version of James Bond, which makes for a much better movie.",positive
"Awesome Bond film, loved it and the best by far for a very long time. Really goes back to the essence of what the Bond Character always was in the Flemings books",positive
Brought back the James Bond series after they almost ruined it with the last Pierce Brosnan one,positive
"A bit rubbish really, Jason Bourne would have Bond any day...",negative
The worst Bond film of all time,negative
"It will stand alone from other Bond movies as it sets the stage of the Bond world, but where does it go from here? Probably back to formuliac Bond movies, that is what have kept the movie series alive for so long. I missed those aspects (like the music) while watching this installment.",negative
"While I've liked the 007 series for a long time, this is a new flavor for Bond, a much darker one. I'm looking forward to the next one...",positive
"Just when I was getting sick of Bond, they go and make it cool again.",positive
A good movie with a lot of twists,positive
mads mikkelsen is anoying me,negative
"martin campbell has made the 2 best bond films of the past 40 years (goldeneye and casino royale). the only other bond film that truly comes close, in my mind anyway, is guy hamiltons goldfinger. bond is reimagined for the post jason bourne era and in doing so comes into his own. for the first time since honey ryder strolled onto the beach in doctor no bond is not a novelty. its not about whose trying to destroy the world, its not about what gadget bond has got to do the job, its about making a man who time had passed by relevant again. its not about reinventing the wheel, but creating something new altogether. theres bone jarring action, classic bond wit, fast cars, beautiful women and, in quite a surprise, a well fleshed out, brilliantly developed and entirely engaging story. there is something missing from pretty much all bond films: characterization. its important in making us give a damn about whose on screen. and in this installment its on screen in spades. im sure a great deal of credit must go to paul haggis for making this happen. taking a page from the batman begins school of thought: ""jeez the last couple have been dross, lets start again"", casino royale acts as a non-chronological reboot. not a prequel, but a fresh start. we go back to start and see a james bond who has just been awarded 00 status, one who doesnt quite know the ropes and is vulnerable to a great many things. we see a new bond, a different bond and then our old favorite all in the space of one movie. misgivings about daniel craig are simply forgotten now. the man is bond. perhaps moreso than connery. hes a man who you take seriously, a man who demands you take him seriously and its because of this the film achieves its initial aim: realism. he delivers a bond thats less about being suave, being a 60's special agent, and more about being practical and getting the job done. a great film, a profound step in the right direction, bring on 'quantum of solace'.",positive
"So this was my first ever Bond experience that I was forced to watch. However, I am pleased to say I was pleasantly surprised, I actually enjoyed the film and it probably would have been even better if it was getting my 100% attention",positive
"I have alwasys enjoyed bond ever since i was small, I think that this bond is the best one so far.",positive
EVEN THOUGH HES BLONDE A GOOD FILM,positive
"Daniel Craig is a little less the quirky Bond and more the ""I'm going to fuck up you and your whole family"" Bond - and that is freaking awesome...",positive
Best bond movie thus far!,positive
"At begining, I didn't understand why this movie chose Daniel Craig to be 007. Now I know he is a kind handsome actor who maybe doesn't looks good but he has a deeply catching!!",negative
"I liked it and Daniel Craig is super fit and tough, but I don't feel he has the charisma and screen presence that most of the other actors had. And for me, that a big part of the atrraction with the Bond films",positive
"One of the more realistic Bond films and, like Timothy Dalton's 007 outings, more true to Ian Fleming's creation. The tower crane fight is one of the best fights in the series.",negative
"Pretty good movie. Well-done to Craig in redefining Bond a bit. The action scenes were pretty good, and the story was alright, the acting was pretty good from everyone too. The pulling back on the cheesy one-liners was a godsend. I know the character of Bond is in the cheekyness to some extent, but God, a lot of them were bad enough to detract from a decent movie. Not so much here, the one-liners are there, but far more subtle.",negative
"La mejor de las ultimas entregas de James Bond , que bella es Eva Green",positive
Could he get any hotter?,positive
"The rating is in comparison to other Bond films. I thought it portrayed a very human side of James Bond, it is more gritty and deep than a typical Bond film.",positive
I never thought there would be competition with sean connery until now. and i've seen every bond flick,positive
"Daniel Craig is easily the best actor to ever play Bond, and even those this movie suffers from some serious pacing issues, his performance is dead on. Not to mention he oozes more manliness than all of 300. And that whole Parcour scene in the first ten minutes is one of those moments in cinema I could watch over and over again.",positive
i love daniel craig yum yum,positive
the other dude wuz better,negative
It's awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"I'm in love with Daniel Craig. That's it. Great acting, a good story (for once!), only mistake was that it wasn't nominated for the Oscars...",positive
"Truly and utterly brilliant. Having seen all of them, this is indeed the best James Bond movie. Everything about it is just extraordinary. Out of all the Bond films, this has the best script, best direction, best opening, best girl, and the best actor to ever portray bond. Sean Connery is still the best Bond, as he defined the role, but Daniel Craig only loses by a slim margin. The ending is also the best out of any film in the series. I submit that it's actually one of the best endings to any film ever. The action is great, the characters are realistic and make you care for them, and the tone is devoid of camp. Simply and purely, it is the best.",positive
"Bond is back, and he's better than ever. The best film since Goldeneye, and Danny Craig is just what this franchise needed. The film itself is edgy and compellingly filmed. The denouement took too long, and slowed down what was otherwise a fast-paced, high-stakes spectacular 007 outing.",positive
One of the best Bond films for a long time. Absolutely amazing.,positive
"This is simply NOT a bond movie. Some series did not need this whole 'reboot' trend we are seeing these days. However, as a non bond movie, its not too bad.",negative
Best James Bond film ever....btw ladies Daniel Craig half naked...BONUS,positive
"This is simply a very bad Bond picture. The actor does not look the part to my mind. It was a horrible decision to hire him. Even though the action was impressive, the typical Bond atmosphere did not come across. I still cherish the hope that another actor might help to resuscitate the Bond series. Nevertheless, this picture is probably the final step in the series' decline that has taken place in the past ten years.",negative
daniel craig better then expected and the action scenes were way better than i expected. the lack of CGI made me happy however it seemed that bopnd got messed up a lot of the time. all in all i thought it was a decent movie in the bond series.,negative
"Holy crap! Daniel Craig! Bond! Coulda done without the last 20 minutes, but holy crap!",positive
The best James Bond movie ever. Daniel Craig is even more better than Sean Connery.,positive
"le pire des tous les james bond... cassage de mythe, ce qui devient une habitude...",negative
"Wow, Daniel C is amazing as JB, as sexy as Sean Connery, he sure worked a treat to get me into the movies to see this one. Looking forward to the next JB...",positive
"I'm one of the few who hasn't been a devout Bond fan in the past, but i still have appreciation for most of them. However, this is a quality action movie and Daniel Craig is immensely superior to Bronsman and Connery, i don't care how classic they are. It was the best Bond thus far!",positive
I liked that blonde Bond from the start...,negative
Decent first effort for Daniel Craig; though plot a bit weak (need a cold war to make it enthralling),negative
"A huge piece of cow dung. Daniel Craig is great, but I can watch great movies like Layer Cake to see him without this garbage that has 8 climaxes and about 25 logical closing points... reminded me why, no matter who plays Bond, the movies are shit.",negative
The scene where he walks out of the sea in those wee blue pants!!!!!!!!!! made me pant!,positive
"If I wanted to watch somebody playing poker for 2 hours, I'd watch the Poker Million! Action bits are okay, but you always know what's gonna happen with James Bond films!",negative
the free-running is amazing a video game based on this movie would be really really cool too.,positive
i will get used to him as bond... good story... used to be my favorite bond book.,negative
Wow. Best Bond movie Evar? I say yes.,positive
a necessary reboot for the franchise.,positive
Not a bad 007 movie. Needed more gadgets,negative
Do I have to comment? It was amazing in all of Daniel's and especially Eva's glory. Beautiful. Awesome. Delicious. Revengeful. Best of them all.,positive
LE CHIFFRE!!!!!! ROFL,positive
"My third favorite Bond movie of all time, leading just behind From Russia With Love and Goldfinger. It revolutionized Bond. For 40 years the series was about beautiful women, fancy gadgets, and villians with plan to harm most of the world. The only other time such a change was taken was from A View to A Kill to The Living Daylights, but even the change wasn't enough to revolutionize Bond. But in 2006 Bond was brought back to his roots. If the previous iteration of the franshise's bond was a finely honed arrowhead, the new generation Bond is a bludgeon, a rough diamond encrusted one. He may have the finesse to bed any woman he comes across, but he lacks the suave sophisticated manner of an older more experienced Bond. Many people were in utter disbelief when Daniel Craig was cast into the role, people believing that being blonde would completely take away from the original character Ian Fleming had created. I never had an opinion on this, but when I saw the movie, I was blown away by his performance. This is the first Bond movie that has emotionally drawn me into the character. I saw Bond as a human being and not as the super spy. He reacts to a situation not with his head, but with his heart. He goes with his gut instinct, that even he doesn't fuly understand. Hes susceptible to enemy taunts, and without much forthought, grab a knife and prepare to kill his target in an publc place. Although many die hards would disagree that the reboot was a good thing, i believe it is just what we Bond fans needed. The last two Brosnan Bonds were lackluster at best. Merely CGI extravaganzas that were so tongue in cheek it became hard to watch. This film is exactly what a 2000's audience wants. Dirty, gritty, hardcore Bond with a depth in the characters that haven't been seen since On Her Majesty's Secret Service.",positive
"One of the Best Bond films if not ""second best"" to Goldfinger of course. It was close to the classic like Bond movies. A Must see",positive
"Like a lot of people, I too think that this is the best 007 movie. Craig gives Bond a more human face, more realistic than Brosnan ever did. Hurray",positive
"Not a big bond fan, but this was brilliant!",positive
Daniel Craig has to be the ugliest James Bond ever!! It sucks that they are going to use him for another 3 JB movies. :-(,negative
perhaps the best Bond ever!,positive
good way to take 007 back. Craig's definetly the best Bond after Sean Connery. Funny and deathly fascinating. The love plot is a lil bit trivial but we can affort it... ;-),negative
"fANTASTIC! A new lease of life for bond,Back to mean and moody and not a raised eyebrow in sight",positive
Too long. Boring as fuck. Not enough hot chicks.,negative
"The best Bond movie ever made; not to mention, Daniel Craig is the best bond known to man and the sexiest at that. His performance in this movie is incredible and the movie itself is magical ;)",positive
"Den beste James Bond filmen jeg har sett, (men jeg har ikke sett sÃ¥ mange). Et must for Bond fans skulle en tro",negative
OMG I Love Daniel Craig :),positive
"Probably the best Bond movie I've seen, granted I haven't seen a great deal of them. Daniel Craig does an outstanding job of bringing humanity back to the character and finally elevating the role above schtick-laden catch-phrases that plagued the Pierce Brosnan films.",positive
"While some have called this the best Bond movie to date, I disagree. No one can replace Sean Connery, and the only one to come close was Pierce Brosnan. Daniel Craig does not have the flair and pinosh of a true Bond. A good action movie though.",negative
"Finally! The first novel done RIGHT! Way to go, guys!! Thanks!!!",positive
Daniel Craig is HOT!!!,positive
love it!! daai arme kar... hehe,positive
"hmmm wonderful scenery and Daniel Craig, molto bello!!!",positive
"Best Bond flick since Sean Connery. Very pleasantly surprised! Not perfect, but very good",positive
nema chybu!od zacatku dokonce!nepostradatelny vyborny hlasky!,positive
the only time I recognize Daniel is when he's naked!that man is HOT!He's in Tomb Raider too!,positive
daniel craig could be my bond anyday!,positive
"I wasn't keen on Craig initially, but I was convinced of his Bond by the end. Only negative was the torture scene - way too much for me to handle. The poker game had me riveted!",positive
"Great new bond, very good casting very fun exciting film",positive
"FÃ¥r Ã¥ vÃ¦re erlig sÃ¥ mener jeg at dette er den beste filmen i bondserien. Kansje ikke mest klassisk Bond, men absolutt den beste filmen. Og absolutt mest ""MAN""",positive
BEST JAMES BOND MOVIE WITH THE BEST JAMES BOND!,positive
One of the best James Bond movies ! I also love the soundtrack by Chris Cornell...,positive
"Good movie but, His balls must have turned into mash potatoes. He couldn't have survived that.",positive
"Absolute rubbish of a Bond movie. Daniel Craig can be his own action hero, as Jason Stratham is, but Craig is no Bond by any stretch of the imagination.",negative
"2006's entry into the Bond Franchise is simply the best in a long while. The studio is re-inventing Bond, finally doing the film that should have been done about the book Casino Royale (short story actually) originally. The film introduces Bond and promotes him to double-oh status for the first time, bringing him from nowhere to top gun. Judi Dench reprises her role as M, a really outstanding actress if ever there was one, and Daniel Craig makes the most believable Bond in ages as he goes through what the book version Bond has on numerous occasions. The torture scene is not for the faint of heart but he is every bit the super agent we want him to be during that. Ultimately we find we are cheering for the man we expect, but not without a lot of good hard action. My one faulting was the poker game really seems inappropriate to me, since the story is set with Baccarat, but that's a petty quibble at best. Very excellent film for the Franchise and hopefully will bring new life to a long series of wonderful action thrillers.",positive
"Seen'em all, best'em all.",positive
Fun action movie. Even a decent plot and semi realistic action. But this isn't Bond. I don't care if you're trying to reinvent or show him before he was sauve.... Craig isn't Bond.,negative
My first Bond movie - a......MAZE....ing..... wow. Blew my mind. I have now begun watching all the originals :),positive
Craig truly shut up his critics with this great movie.,positive
Bond hasn't been this good since Connery! We finally get a Bond that's a true badass. The movie steered clear of the lame action-scenes we saw with Brosnan and gave us some real cut-throat suspense. I can't wait for the next one!,positive
"Great Movie, Better If It Wasn't A Bond Movie Since Daniel Craig Isn't Your Stereotypical Bond With The Slicked Back Black Hair. Regardless, He Still Does A Great Job.",positive
He is not a James Bond.,negative
A good bond movie that only gets dull at the long poker game. One the best scenes was at the beginning when bond chases the bomber on and in buildings and on top of cranes. Leaves a cliff hanger ending which will be answered hopefully in Quantum of Solace.,positive
The best Bond and Best Aston,positive
Awesome Movie! This 007 has the Hottest Bond of the Other 007 Movies,positive
a good start for 007,positive
Bond is Bond. Teaches you a great lesson about women,positive
"I dont give a toss about Bond, but I dig this film. Makes me wanna give the series another chance, and follow the new films as they come out.",positive
"great movie, great acting, great plot",positive
Wasn't sure if Daniel Craig could pull this off but he did a fantastic job. What a bond great,positive
"Daniel Craig cor , he rocks!! Loved it. Can't wait til the next one comes out!",positive
My favorite Bond ever (sorry Sean!),positive
"In my opinion, I beleive that this was the best Bond Movie Ever, In terms of action, I still believe that Pierce Bronsnon was a better bond, but overall Craig did a great job, A+ Movie, very entertaining, just wish that they would have picked a better girl to play his love interest!!!",positive
ca change des precedent,positive
"Hands down the best Bond movie ever made. Daniel Craig is much better playing James Bond than any other actor, especially Pierce Bronson. This movie deserves 2 thumbs up!",positive
This movie makes Bond cool again.,positive
Best James Bond movie ever ? Maybe. Closest adaptation to it's Ian Fleming source novel ? Definately.... Loved it!,positive
"Not usually a James Bond fan, but this one was pretty good. About a half-hour too long, though.",negative
"Bond at his best. floggs the shit out of brosnan. its all down the the nitty gritty with this guy, none of this Q high tech gadgets and shit just fists and guns, all you need for a good movie right?",positive
"the bond was cool - the start was awesome - definetly a hard character and bit more bitter then previously bonds - uses daniel craigs physcial presence on the screen as well with a harder edge to inevitable ""kills"" in the movie",positive
One of the best bond movies made,positive
good best ass movie Daniel Craig is gorgeous,positive
YES So much friggin fun,positive
Un film à voir absolument !,positive
My favorite Bond Film.,positive
Bond has become WAY cooler than he ever was! Death to the cheesy one liners!,positive
entertaining better than the real james Bond,positive
This was my one and only Bond movie. EVER,negative
best bond movie ever,positive
I don't like violent movies.. but this one I have to admit I liked.. great Bond character and amazing first scene of the runner. For being a 'blockbuster' it was well made.,negative
might just be the hottest Bond yet!! It was a good movie too!,positive
"you know.. i think i liked this movie. different from any bond movie i've seen, but i'm no expert.",negative
The best Bond movie since From Russia With Love. The best Bond since Connery. May even be better than Connery.,positive
Any 007 is going to be awesome. Awesome action from the first minute,positive
"Great movie. A little slow at times but Daniel Craig does a wonderful job as the new bond. The next one, set to pick up one hour later, looks to be pleasing as well.",positive
"Good film, need to watch it again to confirm but liked what I saw.",negative
Best 007 movie in years. Daniel Craig makes a good Bond.,positive
"A really well put together action movie with a tragic romance in it too, which a times asks a lot from the audience and does not always suceed in the juggling needed.",positive
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie! all-time favourite! :D i cant watch this over, and over, and over..",positive
"This was easily the best 007 movie i've ever scene. There are so many things i can say are great about this movie whther it be the kick-ass action scenes or the brilliant ending. The main point I want 2 make is that if you are going to see any action movie for the time being, don't miss this one. U won't be disappointed",positive
"I was never a big a fan of James Bond, but boy, this movie rocks. Daniel Craig is the man.",positive
"I usually can't stand Bond movies. I do however love spy movies. This is by far the best Bond movie ever made. The plot is gripping, comprehensible and well thought out. Bond is not just a womanizer with fancy toys and glib lines, but a highly capable, hardened, yet vunerable spy master. The foot chase in the beginning was awesome.",negative
"I normally don't like Bond films much at all, and I'm not usually an action film lover, either. Yet this film was definitely one of the best Bond and action films I've *ever* seen. Absolute perfection. Great plot, great acting, great new spin on Bond. I loved every minute.",positive
bringing back the classic feeling of a bond movie that has been missing since golden eye. hits you right in the 007 heart. very very good,positive
Best Bond flick - so far.,positive
Daniel Craig as James Bond...need I say more!,positive
"Quite possibly the best Bond movie ever. Most comparable to From Russia With Love, OHMSS or For Your Eyes Only for the grittier Ian Fleming plot. Daniel Craig makes the most convinving Bond to date.",positive
Was really dubious about this as I was brought up on Roger Moore's comedy Bond and Pierce Brosnan wasn't my cup of tea and daniel craig is in it,negative
"Was disappointed to not have the traditional ""pre-title sequence"" which has characterized Bond movies, and the construction site chase sequence was comical rather than tense. However, Bond seemed quite human in this movie, making him seem a little more vulnerable than the Sean Connery and Roger Moore of the past. Not one of my favorite Bond movies (and I'm a big fan) but definitely worth seeing.",negative
old sexy pants yum yum,positive
The best bond ever (well at least since Connery).,positive
"It was nice to see Bond go back to his darker days. I believe Daniel Craig will get better than this, though. Sean Connery is still so much better.",negative
this film is v Good !,positive
"Daniel Craig has only played the iconic secret agent once and has contributed to giving this franchise the kick up the backside it sorely needed. With Daniel at the helm, could it be a chance to revisit some previous helpings and give them the same treatment with a more sensitive, more vulnerable, more human version of Bond?! But don't entirely lose the dry wisecracks of previous incarnations.",positive
Thrilling movie from start to finish. Supurb performances all the cast especially the hunky Daniel Craig. Can't wait for the next installment.,positive
"Wow, never thought that James Bond would have a comeback like this. Unlike the previous movies this is a top-notch spy thriller. Concentrating on the human side of the James Bond figure, the director matches extravagant stunts, action and hollywood-style villains with european drama. Yeah that's right, Bond now appears as a dragic hero, driven by his emotions while showing off the classic snobish Bond-ish British elegance that we all love (martinis anyone?), and not like an adult version of Spy Kids. Needless to say that Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever, or at least the most talanted actor impersonating Bond, pulling off Campbell's direction. Campbell and Craig have already made a huge leap ahead of the previous movies (and Goldeneye of course) and if they continue that i'm sure we can speak of a great revival of the series and maybe the whole spy genre in general.",positive
ultimate poker action,positive
"Daniel Craig in Swim shorts, would'nt say no I'm affraid!! Even if he isn't Pierce!",negative
Just a fantastic Movie. A very good and very new interpretation of Bond! Loved it and him!!,positive
"At times this movie is hard to follow, but it's worth the watch.",positive
"Terrific. Filmmakers have the brilliant notion of making Bond an honest-to-goodness MI-6 agent, rather than a cartoon superhero, and it works. Casting a cute but plain actress as the love interest is inspired.",positive
"I usually dislike Bond movies, but this was fantastic. Unlike its predecessors it had an engaging plot and most importantly made Bond seem more human. Daniel Craig is the best Bond EVER. Four stars alone for the scene with him in a tiny swim trunks.",positive
Could have gone with less ball torture. I needed to pause it and get a glass of water. And I really wished the ending wasn't so predictable...,positive
i'll call your 2p and raise you 4,negative
"[You commented on this movie] Comments: Plot: James Bond's first 007 mission takes him to Madagascar, where he is to spy on a terrorist Mollaka. Not everything goes as planned and Bond decides to investigate, independently of the MI6 agency, in order to track down the rest of the terrorist cell. Following a lead to the Bahamas, he encounters Dimitrios and his girlfriend, Solange. Im givin this a 5-Star rating even if i have missed start of movie as its brilliant as far as im concerned. wow this movie is fantastic of what i have seen so far i missed the start of it but will be rewatching this and finish off my review properly lol. i love bond movies - great actors, story, and stunts were amazing loved it all i give this movie (thumbs up) Plot: James Bond's first 007 mission takes him to Madagascar, where he is to spy on a terrorist Mollaka.

he brought back bond with a bang!!!!! not as much sex as the orginal bond...and he falls in love which was kinda boring but the rest made up for it..very sexy movie,positive
One of the best Bond flicks. Period.,positive
"Awesome, awesome movie.",positive
The new best Bond ever!!! Ever!!!,positive
"The best Bond movie ever, and Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever. It had more action and a better plot than other Bond movies.",positive
"I liked it. Bond now has a plot. Not just 'cos there are hot girls & bad ppl in the world, but Bond now has feelings, has a mission, a reason why he needs to save the world (or better, save/help someone he loves.)",positive
I'll add more later but I thought this was the best James Bond movie next to A View To A Kill for me..more in just a while.,positive
"This was incredible. Plenty of action, a very fluid plot, plus they capitalized on the texas hold 'em fad. Best Part: opening building jumping scene",positive
"pretty good movie, action packed",negative
"I actually liked this one, and I like Daniel Craig also,LOL",positive
Very good. Although I found the poker commentary to be quite arbitrary.,positive
Great movie! Great new Bond!,positive
"Not as good as the Sean Connery Bond movies, but I love it! Daniel Craig is great in this role.",positive
"Best Bond, and best Bond film in a long time.",positive
I love this new hard core Bond. Cant wait for the next one!!,positive
Le meilleur des james bond selon moi!,positive
"Excellent remake of the original ""spoof"" film. Green and Craig's on-screen romance is superbly acted and the plot was of true 007 caliber!",positive
Even better in Blu Ray,positive
"I did not know what to expect from Daniel Craig, but I think his take on Bond is what I always wanted the character to be like. The movie itself is more of a character piece than the typical straight up action flick that we've gotten used to from Bond. In my book that's a good thing and I hope they keep it up. Probably my new favorite Bond movie, but will have to see how it holds up over time.",positive
The only good James Bond movie really. It's nice to see an action movie where the protagonist basically just gets beat up the whole time.,negative
Brilliant! I knew he'd be awesome as Bond. Probably my 3rd favourite Bond movie after Goldfinger and Live & Let Die.,positive
Best bond film ever!,positive
First bond movie I've really liked and watched the whole way through.,positive
"One of the best, if not THE best Bond film. Brilliant, but the ending was a little drawn-out",positive
The first movie i ever saw was Dr.No. Trust me when i say BEST BOND EVER,positive
Great Movie One of the best Bond Films yet :D,positive
"I went to this movie with all the anticipation of a pregnant women. And yet as much as i enjoyed the high action and the fact that we were seeing something different of bond i personally felt that this movie cannot be considered in the same light as the old one. In fairness to the new one it really should be considered as a new genre of bond movies. If you compare this to say the classic bonds, not meaning brosnans last couple. I would have to ask where has all bond's charm gone, where is the cracked in the mind bad guy intent on taking over the world. Let's compare the bonds. The new one is supposed to show a more human side to Bond, bollocks. This new bond is cold and heartless and has the sense of humour which can be compared to dry stone walling. Added to this he has lost his charm with the ladies, this new bond you picture the only sex he gets is that which he has picked up on the corner, he couldn't charm a epileptic frog let alone a beautiful women. The story lines in bond are suppose to be simple so even the most stupid of people can keep up. The action is supposed to be unbelievable but possible. Craigs super jumping across the building site was so badly filmed i cringed at the sight of it. With all that said i agree bond could not have continued the same. A> you cannot compete with the originals and B> people will get bored of even sex if given to much. That said they could of just left the bond movies as they were. This new bond spy movie is definitely entertaining but the character could easily have been given a different name and started a new brand of spy movie. this really is a high action, highly entertaing spy movie, but it has no soul, no laughter. As a apy movie i would say it is definitely a breath of fresh air from the pathetic MI2 and MI3. As a bond movie he just cannot fill the shoes of connery, hell he's not even better than moore. All in all then i am in the middle with this film. It was not bond but then it was the best action spy movie in such a long time. Quick sidenote. New title quantum of solace. Whoever came up with that should be taken out, shot, cut into little peices and fed to the fishes. Those fishes should then be deprived of water, deep fried, fed to the special effects man of the building site climing scene. That man should made to attempt every jump bond did to show how proposteriously unrealistic they were, then be hung drawn and quartered simply as a lesson. Sidenot two. Eva green is bangin",negative
I successfully knew which one was Bond the whole time.,negative
Slick and enjoyable.,positive
"i didn't get why critics and fans loved it. I have not seen many bond movies, but this movies was just ok",negative
"Excellent Bond film. Daniel Craig is the new Bond, without taking anything from Sean Connery, who was the best in my opinion.",positive
"The new face of james bond. Too ""Bournesque"" for me to be great.",negative
"The best bond film ever. As much as Daniel Craig was doubted when he was first cast in this movie, he really pulled it off. I also liked the way they brought Bond back to reality to reverse the trend of making Bond films a parody of themselves (maybe Austin Powers had something to do with that).",positive
"Definitely not Daniel Craig's best movie, but it was okay.",negative
Es una pelicual buena de accion pero prefiero los otros Bond.,negative
"This movie had all that I expected in a Bond film, and more. Unfortunately, the ""more"" was a gratuitous torture scene that pretty much ruined the movie for me. Cut that scene and it gains 1/2 star.",negative
"Who the hell is this, Americano shoot-em-up. This isn't bond, Sean would be disgraced. And what is with the testical thrashing?",negative
"The best Bond. Ever. Craig is perfect as a dark and brooding, almost anti-hero kind of Bond. Eva Green is every bit his equal - love the witty exchanges between the two of them. The action is gritty - the fight scenes are a great display of Bourne-like efficiency and realism. And that opening chase scene...well worth the price of admission. This is Bond as a human being - not a perfect super hero, and what a Bond it is. Of course, if you're looking for true escapism, then this Bond's not for you. But in terms of a new, grittier take on both the Bond films and the spy genre, this movie is fantastic.",positive
"Finally Bond becomes human. He is a driven man, but you can clearly see that he is also tormented by his work. Craig is brilliant.",positive
"After being left slightly dissapointed by 'Die Another Day', Daniel Craig brings a new lease of life to 007, good storyline, good action and good acting. Can't wait for 'Quantum of Solace', even if it does sound like an Indiana Jones movie.",positive
Great debut for Daniel Craig as James Bond. Fantastic revival of the series after a few lackluster movies in theh franchise. Grittier movie which looks back at Bond's early career. A must watch!,positive
great bond film. craig is a great bond. the best bond film yet,positive
It's the second best Bond film of the modern era (behind Golden eye) The bond girls are no so great in this one (though she looks nice in that dress she wears for the poker but you do expect a bit more blatant objectifying of women really. Plus the hand he wins with in the end is a fluke and you can hardly blame all three players for going all in (full house vs four of a kind vs straightflush - so it's not skill it's luck but then that is the same with all 007 escapes),negative
This has to be one of the dullest Bond's of all time. It looks like many of the reviewers are believing the hype about it being the best ever Bond. They only said that to fool you into watching it. One of the worst DVD's I've been given for Christmas,negative
classy n daniel has showed da wrld dat he is no less of a bond !!!,positive
"Bond, reborn. Daniel Craig manages to nail the elusive hard edged, yet still smooth & charming Bond. Recent Bond movies have been rather lude & immature, with Bond's gadgets serving as Deus Ex Machina for every action sequence - which this movie lacks and is all the better for it. Last 1/4 of the film was not as great, due to noisy fuckers in the room that couldn't keep their mouths quiet. *cough*",negative
A bold new direction for the super spy that is exciting as well as intelligent.,positive
"Alongside ""Dr. No"", the best Bond movie. Daniel Craig and Eva Green are fantastic, the action scenes are exciting, realistic and brutal... A-ma-zing!!!",positive
"When Goldeneye came out, a lot of people said Brosnan was almost as good as probably the best Bond ever, Sean Connery. Daniel Craig makes Pierce Brosnan look like a soggy cupcake.",positive
"mediocre, casting was terrible",negative
"Fuer eine ausfuehrliche Kritik dieses Films, besuche bitte den Weltraumaffen (http://www.weltraumaffe.de.tc)! For an detailed review of this Movie, please visit the Weltraumaffe (http://www.weltraumaffe.de.tc)! (German!)",negative
Best. Bond. Movie. Ever.,positive
Bond... James Bond. <3,positive
They did something new and different but at the same time kept the essential qualities of a Bond film. Ten minutes in I had forgotten about the previous Bond films (Die Another Day for example) and was just hooked.,positive
"Now this was a fun movie to watch. Though I am a fan of Brosnan and Connery, I really was surprised at how entertaining Craig was in the role. Awesome action scenes and a great plot just made it for me.",positive
"This is a movie that needs to be watched twice. It has a strange tone which kind of defies the usual Bond aura, but it's something I really appreciated and became comfortable after subsequent viewings. Daniel Craig was a risk- he is a much darker-spirited character than Bonds past, but this serves the film well. Classy, fierce, quick-pulsed and dangerous, 007 is back and edgier than ever.",positive
Best Bond flick in a very long time.,positive
"I'm torn about Daniel Craig as Bond. But he does, as everyone has said, bring some nice badassery to the franchise, so good on him for that, I guess.",negative
no es x la pelicula...es x lo ke implica,positive
My congratulations to Mr. Daniel Craig !!! WOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"i liked the plot and daniel craig is pretty, but i wish he would have some facial expressions.",negative
Strong Bond film. I approve of Daniel Craig.,positive
"It is a successful reboot of the Bond series and a great action flick. Like any good bond film that's supposed to restart everything, it carries a healthy number of references to keep the bond fans happy.",positive
Don't like this dude as Bond at all.,negative
"A top movie, it did drag on a little too much, but over all Daniel Craig and the darker side of Bond revitalised the Franchise",positive
well the big Q is will i ever trust a woman? I cant answer that now,positive
the best bond - great action and i even got the plot the second time around,positive
Daniel Craig and Eva Green make it tolerable.,negative
The best Bond film to date,positive
Not as good as past James Bond movies but still ok,negative
"I love our new Bond, in all his blondness",positive
hes better than pierce,positive
One of the greatest bond movies yet.,positive
Good to see less mobo jombo and special efects,negative
This film is everything and I love Daniel Craig!,positive
"A worthy rebooting of the James Bond franchise. The chase scene at the beginning alone is worth the price of admission. Unfortunately, though, this movie tries to be different from all the Bond films that came before it by getting rid of all the things that make James Bond who he is: namely the gadgets, martinis (shaken, not stirred), and baccarat! Don't get me wrong, this is a great, entertaining spy flick, but a true BOND movie it isn't. Still, it's better than anything Roger Moore has ever done, so I guess I really shouldn't knock it.",negative
Only Bond movie I've ever seen.,positive
Not the best James Bond movie made,negative
The only Bond that really interested me.,negative
le meilleur des james bond,positive
"Nothing special. So far so good. But within James Bond, this is a better one.",negative
best bond craig is deadly!,positive
Very good action thriller James Bond sequal that works well. If you like Daniel Craig check out the seasonal show of Rome.,positive
"this new bond movie was surprisingly good... it's dark and exhilarating, but all of the cool gadgets are missing :(",positive
"Wow, I thought Daniel Craig did an excellent job in being the new Bond, James Bond. I think that he's the second best Bond, right behind Sean Connery.",positive
"One of the better James Bond! It s a actual version of the one with Georges Lazenbi. Dark, Exciting, ... A very good entertainement movie!!",negative
Best Bond movie in a long time. I'm glad to see they went back to basics.,positive
"Very watchable and plenty of action, but not the best of the Bond movies. Not enough gadgets (loved the car though !) and didn't feel Daniel Craig had as much charisma as the previous 007s.",negative
A great reboot of the ailing bond franchise.,positive
This movie will possible revive a very tired franchise. Bond movies were becoming predictable and the gadgets and stunts were more sci-fi than believable. This was a brave direction for the Bond franchise but a necessary one. I loved it and hope there is more to come.,positive
The best movie ever! IÂ´ve seen this film about ten times. :D,positive
Looks brilliant on BluRay + I give it an extra half star because it came free with the Playstion 3 :),positive
"A vast improvement over the last few Bond films, this film is the way bond should have been done all along. No fancy gadgets and gimmicks that make this film look cheap and nasty. Its slick, smooth action that is refreshing to watch.",positive
"Craig is excellent in this reprieve of the Bond story. We go back to the beginning of a 00 and see how they are made. The gadgets of previous incarnations are gone and we are left with a taught story and good characterisation. Craig is colder and darker than previous Bonds, but we get to know the man as the movie unfolds. Looking forward to ""Quantum of Solace"" (Bond 22).",positive
i like the start but the rest of it is shit,negative
So amazingly good. I enjoyed it so much that I watched it several times over while I reset all the TV display attributes.,positive
"Craig was lights out. He owned the Bond character. The story was a nice fast-paced action thriller, but nothing amazing though.",negative
"It took over 40 years, but we finally have another Bond movie that dares to take itself seriously. The creamy middle between hyper-realistic ""Bourne"" adventures and whatever lunacy Jason Statham is up to.",positive
"It's a new generation of Bond film. More violence, less sex. You can't really compare with the other Bond films. But I like it",positive
"hey! bonne surprise! un 007 qui inspire notre president (pour le cote bling bling)... comme quoi, toujours se mefier des contres facons !",positive
just because of daniel craig,positive
"the best bond movie yet, a rocking rollercoaster ride highly recomended it will blow you away!",positive
I'd put this up against any Connery Bond.,positive
"I have to say this Bond movie was weird, No gadgets (except ressurection kit), no hidden labs, no big explosions and I dont remember a firm carchase either (no rocket launcher). This 007 is somehow poor.",negative
"Why did this get such lukewarm reviews? Daniel Craig is excellent as Bond - taking it to a different level completely. Pierce Brosnan (who I also think is great) seems quite cartoonish by comparison. I thought it was a little bit too long, my attention was getting tired by the time the final twist came.",positive
The first chase was amazing!!! loved it just for that.,negative
"Yeah, wasn't too bad. It was over-rated though. I was expecting something huge.",negative
i love james bond! this is a fantastic movie as it returns to the original hand-to-hand combat scenes made famous by Sean Connery and is far removed from the efforts by Brosnan with all the gadjets! Craig and Green are electric on screen together. Cant wait for Bond 22!,positive
"Nicely done. Nicely reinvented after Pierce Brosnan. I didn't even see ""Die Another Day"" making it the only bond movie I haven't seen.. I just found Pierce's version of Bond to be outdated. Like a second Roger Moore'ish. I liked Roger Moore now mind you..but as they say..I've already seen that.",positive
Best bond movie yet. daniel craig does a great job playing bond.,positive
I haven't really seen a lot of James Bond movies before so I can't compare it to any others. But this movie has some of the most original and cool action scenes.,positive
Best Bond movie I've ever seen. Characters were real. Action was amazing.,positive
Daniel Craig has brought a new image to James Bond,positive
"Favourite Bond film so far (2007), which says a lot because I've been a fan of the franchise for a decade. Only one to leave a tingle in my spine at the end.",positive
Daniel Craig is almost as good as Sean Connery. Much better than the rest. He makes Bond fun again and Oh so HOT.,positive
"I love bond and this was the best one since live and let die, Craig is bond.",positive
Beste Bond i mine Ã¸yne.,positive
My favorite aJames Bond movie yet. (shut up :P I hear you're scoffing),positive
"I'm a Bond fanatic, and Craig had me worried, but he live up to the role and is tied with Brosnan and Connery for best bond as of right now.",positive
"Freaking amazing. Just as crazy as MI3. I thought the romance was adorable and his kicking butt was... indescribable. Oh, and his whole not dieing after being poisoned was great.",positive
one of the best bond movies,positive
"By far the best Bond movie. Craig is terrific, and it features the recipe for a Vesper, a really delicious cocktail.",positive
My No. 4 Bond flick. Craig is amazing. Story was awesome: close enough to the book and modern enough. We get enough story before the credits. I don't like the music for the gun barrel sequence.,positive
i really liked it the first time but I realize i am just not a fan of 007,negative
I worried about this Bond movie but it turned out good.,positive
Bond came back to our screen's in 2006 with an even bigger bang - Craig was awesome as 007 !!!!,positive
whats going on here :(,negative
"First Bond movie I ever liked! Excellent stunts, especially the building-climbing chase in Madagascar.",positive
yeah... here's hoping the next one is this good.,positive
What a HOT JAMES BOND!,positive
"Other than the lunacy of having to spend 15 minutes watching a house sink into a 12' deep Venice canal, this is the PERFECT Bond movie. It is in my top five, and Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery. Sorry Timothy...",positive
"I loved it. It can make any guy feel cool, even guys like me that aren't.",positive
Ok so there are horrible hollywood-action moments but otherwise this is the best Bond since Goldeneye. All naysayers remember: do you really want to go back to the days of the world is not enough and die another day?,positive
"Thank you to the cast and crew, for making James Bond a real person, with real feelings. You have changed my mind.",positive
"Too busy drooling over DC to concentrate the first time, but brilliant!",positive
An okay action film. Definitely the best Bond movie I have seen.,negative
Is it possible not to enjoy Daniel Craig as Bond?,negative
"I am quite certain the book is much classier but I have to admit,this Bond adventure is the new adventure pack of the century!Campbell's previous experience with GoldenEye was all the more effective.The new era of the most famous screen agent is raw,battered up and darker.",positive
"No more over the top, ridiculous gadetry. No more nonsensical villians. Replaced with gritty, realistic action and emotional depth. This is the new generation Bond movie.",positive
Una de las mejores peliculas de accion. Daniel Craig es el mejor 007,positive
Best Bond movie ever...,positive
"This movie was really amazing. While the plot was somewhat boring -- I could have used a little more action, the acting was amazing, the special effects were great, and the movie was completely believable. Daniel Craig did amazing and I thought he had great chemistry with Eva Green. Overall a great movie, can't wait for the sequel!!!",positive
"Finally a Bond that gives Sean Connery a run for his money! This is the way that Bond is meant to be, and I was definitely leery of Craig taking the reins... Not anymore, can't wait for a WHOLE bunch more!",positive
"This movie was pretty damn amazing other than the falling in love on the boat moments. On my DVD, I fast forward through that ever time and it makes the movie alot better than it already is. Bond is defintely back in this. Next time, ""quantum of Solace?"" I think I liked Phantom menace more as a title.",positive
loved this bond film and daniel craig is wow!!!,positive
"Surprisingly good. Daniel Craig makes a very compelling Jimmy Bond, with his amazing eyes and intensity. But this one also set the standard for the next few to come, with excellent stunts. Storyline couldve been better but it's a Bond film, what can we expect. Looking forward to Bond 22, but bit worried about the title, Quantum of Solace!",positive
"Holy Shit, I just enjoyed a bond film.",positive
"I was a little worried when this film was being developed with the casting and general compulsion to restart everything from scratch taking insiration from Batman Begins and so was pleasantly surprised to find the best Bond since OHMSS. It successfully updates and blends Fleming's dated novel Casino Royale into the modern world and finds in Daniel Craig the best Bond since Connery. I was getting sick of the tailors dummies that were being cast in the role, particularly Brosnan who looked ridiculous fighting muscular heavies with his stick thin atrophied frame and his irish/american lilt increasingly dominating his delivery of lines. Daniel Craig can act and has made himself look physically capable of the action these films demand. He may not look classic Bond but then neither did Connery and Craig has that same facial ruggedness combined with suaveness that enabled Connery to make the part his own and is a much better actor. I will leave whether he is good looking enough to the ladies to decide. Casting Judi Dench as M is the only misfire as it effectively airbrushs all the other Bond films from history. She can't be the same M who first met Bond in Goldeneye and Dench's overly tetchy performance merely reminds one of how good Bernard Lee was in the role. Personally I think after this they should return to the normal Bond formula but I hear they are going to continue this story which I fear is a mistake. We shall see.",positive
"A good actor as Bond, although he dosent hold a candle to Sean Connery but this was actually a good film. Better than i expected.",negative
Good return to form for Bond,positive
I liked Daniel Craig as 007! This movie was a pleasant surprise and FINALLY got me really interested in the Bond series again!,positive
Best Bond ever ... that's the first when Bond is not Bond,positive
"Finally, a Bond movie I can relate to.",positive
"I didn't like this as much because there was no traditional Bond gadgets or Q, but Daniel Craig is a badass Bond",positive
I love the jump scene in this one.... awesome,positive
Daniel Craig makes a damn good Bond.,positive
This was a really good Bond movie,positive
This is the first Bond film I've seen and I liked it very much! Craig is a perfect Bond!,positive
Excellent. Better than Brosnan. And Roger Moore. Controversial? yes.,negative
i actually thought it was gonna suck because daniel doesnt look anything like the other Bond guys...daniel actually rocked my socks off with his amazing performance...now i really want to see quantum of solace...hes such a great Bond!!!,positive
"Daniel Craig's first Bond film,and he has really proved his critics wrong.Well paced and well acted,with a good amount of action.8/10",positive
"solid...it could use some work, im expecting big things out of the next one...but a really good first stab, and craig will make a good bond...not as good as connery and brosnan but better than moore",positive
"My new favorite Bond movie. Right actor, right amount of danger, right time. Perfect start for Craig and renewed Bond. I want to see it again!",positive
a leaky tear-duct is different,negative
"The best Bond ever made and Daniel Craig, even better then Sean Connery. For the first time I'm looking forward to the new Bond movie.",positive
I never got James Bond until this movie. It kicks ass.,positive
[size=4][color=red]The best Bond film since Goldfinger...by the way who ever said that this movie sucked is an idiot.[/color][/size],positive
One of the best 007 movies ever made!,positive
"Let's get this straight. I don't DO Bond movies. BUT, apparently I do DO Daniel Craig movies. He totally won me over and I can't wait to see Bond 22.",positive
2 étoiles pour la quinte flush,negative
Daniel Craig is a great Bond. He is the best Bond since Sean Connery. This film was a great reintroduction to the character.,positive
"Yes, sweetest bond movie ever Daniel Craig was amazing at being 007",positive
"By far the best James Bond film ever! Daniel craig is spot on, as the Suavre ASSASIN!",positive
I WASN'T CONVINCED DANIEL CRAIG WAS THE MAN TO BE BOND BUT I WAS PROVED WRONG THIS IS FANTASTIC FILM AN IS THE WAY IAN FLEMING MADE BOND,positive
Great starter from Daniel Craig as 007.,positive
He Can Become as nearly as good as Sean,positive
The best James Bond film to date. (don't care much for the old ones...),positive
"Definitely the best Bond yet. This bond is cold, calculating, and to the point. He's not a womanizing pos with an alchohol problem. Looked dangerous. Movie was nicely done as well.",positive
"Daniel Craig was battered by people complaining that he was ""James Blond"" being that he's the only blond bond. He was probably the toughest bond of all. He brought a realistic darkness to bond that Timothy Dalton & Brosnen's Goldeneye only aluded to. I have nothing but Respect for what Craig Brought to the character. Casino royale is the Best place to restart the bond franchise with the best bond... I cant wait till: James Bond in Quantum of Solace.",positive
One of the better Bond movies,positive
"The Best Bond, perhaps ever.",positive
"The best Bond film since Connery. (A tired phrase, but in this case an accurate one) This one saved the franchise, and they owe it all to Jason Bourne, who proved you don't need diamond studded killer sattelites to make a good spy flick!",positive
"Haha. ""You lost ALL the Chinese food?!?"" Good times, good times",negative
i like 007 bond films,positive
"So far the best Bond film I have watched. again, i watch this with a very skeptical mindset that this is just another of those action packed and gadgets galore Bond movie...well, it surprised me with a Bond who can be vulnerable - a pleasant surprise for me and my wife.",positive
"Good flick, one of the better 007 films.",positive
Love James Bond action/shoot out movies. Daniel Craig didn't do bad as the new Bond either. :-D,positive
"Bond at his best. However, this excellent reboot of the series offers something most Bonds do not: character development. You get to see Bond transform into the super spy we all know him to be right from the start of his double-O career. Don't worry, the extreme, mind blowing action sequences and beautiful women are still all there. Oh, and the best title sequence and song for a movie I've experienced in a long time. Craig as Bond? Absolutely, 100% yes.",positive
this guy impressed me with his bond skills,positive
"I was never really a fan of the old James Bond films (though Sean Connery is the only true James Bond in my opinion). However, this movie really doesn't follow in the mold of those films and maybe that is why I enjoyed it. Quite a well-done movie and Craig really is almost as good as Connery.",negative
"Casino Royale is my favorite James Bond film. It takes what made the old films so awesome, the action, the ""cool"", and fearsom baddies and translates those into the modern world. While still keeping the excitement of Bond, the film stays firmly rooted reality, with the action not so over-the-top like those before it. I can't wait to see the sequel, Quantum of Solace!",positive
the best James Bond ever!,positive
"Not really a fan of Bond films, but Craig was excellent, both dressed and undressed. Eva Green also played a great part, amazing title sequence and awesome soundtrack. Great film!",positive
One of the best Bond movies made.,positive
Loved it...and Daniel Craig!,positive
Daniel Craig is perfect for role of James Bond!,negative
"I may not like the character of James Bond, don't get me started, but Daniel Craig made him very appealing. Plus, it was good movie.",positive
"Better than expected - actually enjoyed Mads Mikkelsen's character. I don't find Daniel Craig a TRUE James Bond, but having said that the acting was very good. I liked the movie...",negative
second only to Connery as Bond,positive
Awesome reboot of the franchise.,positive
"Really good action movie,, and the blue eyes (Y)",positive
The best bond movie...,positive
"Bond is back, badder than ever. Enough said.",positive
he's back & better than ever!!!,positive
Dark and dirty Bond. Lots of fun!,positive
Bond is back and possibly better than ever in this movie.,positive
The best Bond film EVER!!!!,positive
This guy was born to be Bond,positive
"thought it was BORING. fuck this playing cards shit, do something awesome!",negative
Daniel Craig is deffinetly the new Bond he was great,positive
"I can't get enough Bond films. This is one of the best in my opinion, but lets hope they loosen up by the next movie.",positive
"I love all James Bond Movies. Even the ones that are really, really lame.",negative
"this is probably the best 'Bond' movie i've ever seen. it was more updated than the others and starting at the beginning gives us a whole new outlook on james bond and how he really did become 007. this movie seems way more believable than anything else, because instead of secret plots to take over the world - and don't get me wrong, those movies are awesome too! - however talking about losing poker and financing terrorism is something that also gives bond a more realistic feel. and the torture scenes show a human feel, that james bond isn't invincible, he's a normal guy, and those are aspects you need. i loved this bond movie!! i can't wait to see daniel craig portraying bond again!",positive
Best Bond Ever!!!!!!,positive
Un des meilleurs James Bond selon moi.,positive
One of the best Bond flicks. Love the undying action that was expected.,positive
just love the scene where bond is coming out of the sea!!!!!,negative
Definitely the best Bond since Sean Connery!,positive
"It was a pretty good movie, if you are a Bond fan you will enjoy it.",negative
double OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!,positive
Possibly the best Bond film yet and Craig himself is second only to Sir Sean.,positive
Used to love Connery...actually still do...but I do believe Daniel Craig has taken over as the best Bond. Never thought anyone would.,positive
Cool as hell. Daniel Craig IS the new Bond. Lookin forward to the second with him.,positive
"SkjÃ¸nte ikke alt oppstusse over denne jeg... Tynn storyline, og bildene fra badescenen var jo langt bedre enn selve scenen... Mye action uten innhold= ikke engasjerende",negative
i think daniel craig did a gr8 job,negative
Best Bond by far. After invisible cars and all that nonsense we get a gritty and darker superspy by well cast Craig.,negative
"The new actor did a good job, he is very bond-like. I didn't really like the plot of the movie though. It was basically a card game with some dumb plot twists and action scenes spliced in...",negative
"Great new Bond. Intense and exciting, can't wait for more.",positive
Very awesome- I agree- Daniel Craig makes an excellent Bond. It was a story i could follow...,positive
My favorite of all the Bond movies I've seen. Love that we sort of get to see another side of 007 in this movie. Definitely can't wait to see more of Daniel Craig as James Bond.,positive
"The best all around movie in the Bond series,and a great start for Daniel Craig",positive
I'd give this six stars if I could. Re-invents James Bond. Craig is better than Connery - amazing stuff.,positive
Daniel Craig is a great Bond,positive
This took me by surprise - Daniel Graig makes a great bond - however lacks sex appeal,positive
I loved this! He is one of the best Bonds I've seen and by far the hottest! Loved the story line!,positive
"He's got that dry approach that Connery used to have and I found him very Steve McQueen like. Best bond after Roger+Sean.Yep he's Bond, and He's Blond. And he's got a DBS.",positive
"I liked this, but seeing Daniel Craig nakedparts was exciting, too.",negative
"Really good, appart from Daniel Craig's box-like quality, i thought a pretty good film all round.",positive
one of the best bond films in a long time,positive
Best Bond movie ever. Who would have thought that Daniel Craig would be this good as Bond. Awesome movie.,positive
"Daniel Craig was great in layer cake, I expected just the same in this picture.",positive
The hottest James Bond so far,positive
This just might be my favorite James Bond movie; but I just don't know yet!,positive
The best Bond ot them all!,positive
probably th best Bond so far,positive
James Bond gets in sick...he never lets that happen...,negative
"My favorite Bond. Grittier, with more emotion and fewer cliches.",positive
"Not the best Bond, but definitely best Bond movie.",positive
By far the best Bond film of the last 20+ years.,positive
Best Bond movie ever! Daniel Craig is amazing!,positive
Best Bond for years. Action actually fits in with the storyline which hasnât been the case in more recent films. Craig is an extremely good actor but is he actually Bond material? The jury's still out. This film is the film it is because of the restraint shown from Martin Campbell to not use an unlimited amount of special effects which have plagued more recent Bond films with continuity issues.,positive
Just excellent!!! Definitevily the best Bond-movie ever!,positive
"Loved this film. Exciting, clever, loads of action, fast pace, kept my attention the whole way through.",positive
"Without argument the greatest James Bond film they've ever produced. Daniel Craig owns this character: a blunt instrument, a cold motherfucker. The early footchase will go down as one of the best in history, and even the poker tournament manages to create tension. An intelligent take on the adventures of 007; a high-quality production.",positive
"new bond, hyper action styled!",positive
I like Craig as the new Bond. Hopefully they'll continue to be gritty like this one.,positive
No more Gadget-Bond; as Bond should be.,negative
Pretty awesome movie. great action scenes.. great story line i hope to see more i thought it was the darkest of the bunch and it made it more interesting.. but the only problem i had was i thought the movie ended 3 times..,positive
"I will admit that Daniel Craig is a good actor, but I won't say he's proved himself to me as a Bond yet. I don't have a problem with him being blonde, but he wasn't tall enough to properly swagger. He was too squatty and crawly all the time. I did like how Bond was able to crack into M's stuff, and how you got to see part of her personal life. Maybe it's because I like card games, but I did enjoy this movie despite its length.",positive
The best James Bond film I have seen.,positive
bond is back and he's a badass! no more sissy bond. this is the bond we've always wanted and the one that jason bourne had to force out of this franchise.,positive
this movie wuz so kool..Daniel Craig is a great james bond,positive
Another good Bond movie.,positive
liked this movie alot more than I expected to. I loved how rough and inexperienced JB was. It was a breath of fresh air to see him make mistakes and get hurt by the ladies.,positive
It would have been the best Bond movie to date if it were not for those last 30 minutes.,negative
Daniel Craig...what more can I say than: EYE CANDY!!!!! Great movie...can't wait to see the next one!,positive
The absolute best James Bond film of them all!!! With the exeption it not haveing Sean Connery (sp?) the all time greatest James Bond... But the new guy (Daniel Craig) takes second... The movie was absolutely mindblowing... Everyone should see it even if they saw previous 007 Films and didn't like them...,positive
"Not the usual Bond movie, but very good nonetheless.",positive
Daniel Craig makes an excellent Bond. Very good.,negative
Love the Bond Collection and it's a great remake/spin off of the Original (unsupported) Bond Movie,positive
"Not usually a bond fan but Daniel Craigs portrayal of a rougher, tougher bond is great. Still have to whince everytime I watch the chair scene, that's even more painful to watch than rolling the Aston!",negative
best bond ever(sorry pierce just too old),negative
just what the bond franchise needed. a bit rough around the edges and one or two scenes that had me caring for some characters. a nice peice film action,positive
"Real Bond. Daniel Craig is spot on, tough, rough and cold. Sort of guy you wouldn't want to befriend. Craig shows his skill as an actor by being the first bond for a while who is Bond as Fleming wrote it, not some clothes horse driving a silver car.",positive
This movie is freakin awesome!,positive
"wanted to give it 4.5, but couldn't quite. different bond, badass bond",positive
"If you hate all the other Bond movies, see this one!",positive
This is the Bond I remember from the books. A ruthless Military Intelligence officer with a licence to kill and kill he does as well as enjoy his maleness with females. In addition we see his vulnerabilities. Holy smokes its got everything. Good to see you back in your proper M.O.,positive
"It is James Bond's movie which goes out of the prize among the others, and I like.",positive
******BOND IS BACK****,positive
By far the best modern Bond film - Daniel Craig is more real than the other Bonds.,positive
"I finally saw it and... LOVED IT! Didn't think I was going to like Daniel Craig (I'm more of a Sean Connery girl); however, I was impressed. Two thumbs up!",positive
i still love to see Jame Bond being a c*nt!,positive
Not in the same line of Bond films. A bit more violent. A bit long. Letdown.,negative
YUM!!!! Daniel Craig revalidates the Bond franchise in this fast paced and smart new Bond movie. Let's not forget that the man is also absolutely beautiful!!!,negative
Best Bond movie in a long time.,positive
"This is a Bond movie, but there are no cartoon characters who make bad puns and cheesy pick up lines. Daniel Craig is the gritty Bond that Ian Flemming always pictured and I think it works.",positive
"Best Bond. Well, best Bond since Connery days.",positive
Easily the best Bond flick ever made,positive
Good. Very Good though I still find it hard to recover from a heart attack and then play poker immdiatly after...,negative
Of course as always it's hard to believe the plot....but Daniel Craig is the hottest Bond ever!!!!,positive
"not bad, and i dont like this 007 !!",negative
Wow. Daniel Craig makes for one hell of a Bond. PS Chris Cornell is awesome!,positive
"It was an okay James Bond movie... the whole casino scenes were crap, as c'mon, how can you make watching people play texas hold'em ""exciting""? The rest of the film was good, but that whole casino part just ruined it... Pierce Brosnan and Sean Connery, hell the rest of them (except for that In The Queen's Service dude) were all better bonds then Daniel Craig, as hey, they were actually FROM the UK, where the character of James Bond is from.",negative
One of my all time favorite movies.,positive
"great opening scene, but lackluster in the middle to late.",negative
"James Bond, as a raw and emotional thrill ride. One of the better movies from this franchise.",positive
"You knew the old bond was out of the window when Craig drowns a man in a sink, after savagely beating him.",positive
"extra half star for being the best bond movie probably ever, definitely since connery",positive
"i love the new bond, the movie has a new look to it too, wonderful!",negative
love it! daniel craig is fiiiine!,positive
best bond movie in my opinion,positive
Daniel Craig is a much better Bond than Brosnan and the soundtrack is hella good too.,positive
Best Bond movie! Craig is doing Bond the way he should have been from the beginning,positive
Awesome movie. Love Daniel Craig as Bond.,positive
only thing is the beginning is the best with the black dude with his free running,negative
Next best to Connery. But the movie itself is better than any of Seans.,positive
great film just didnt really feel like a bond film.,positive
worst bond movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,negative
gets points for being the only bond film I've stayed awake through!!,negative
One of the best Bond movies of our time!,positive
Bond is back. Best action film of 2007,positive
EL MEJOR JAMES BOND DE TODA LA HISTORIAÂ¡Â¡ ADEMAS LE HACE AL PARKOURÂ¡Â¡Â¡ Y ESTE WE SI ESTA LOCO,positive
Dind't think I was gonna like because I'm loyal to Connery and Brosnan but it changed surprised me.,negative
"Best James Bond film in years. Daniel Craig rocks, the action is exihirating and the plot is believable. Roll on Bond 22!",positive
"Awesome James Bonds movie. I normaly just watch the opening scene with the gadgets then get bored and walk away, but this was really good. Good story, good action, love the opening chase scene.",positive
pretty good. and so long!,negative
A Neat start over to the Bond Franchise.,negative
I didn't even understand the plot and I loved this movie.,positive
Best Bond I've seen in ages.,positive
Entertaining. Over-long. Bourne-esque. Watchable.,negative
The best Bond movie since Goldfinger.,positive
"At last...a much realistic and darker movie about 007.Even if the fans dont like the idea of a blond James Bond, I found Daniel Craig so perfect as a cold blood killer.And let's not forget Mads Mikkelsen who is awesome as...""LE CHIFFRE"" !!",positive
"A Bond film I actually cared about! I didn't think it was possible! I just thought they were supposed to be about greasy foreign dudes shooting a lot and busty women galavanting about. I didn't think there was room for a story, but I've been shown up here.",positive
COOL MUVIE BUT RUINED BY DA DBS DOIN A 360 FLIP ( LOL ),positive
"I really like the way they've put this together, it's in keeping with the original books, but at the same time it incorporates the mdern gadgets. Cool.",positive
Den beste Bond-filmen paa veldig lenge.,positive
"This film is a bit of a departure from the tried and true Bond formula. I guess I like a Bond who doesn't take himself too seriously, as Daniel Craig's Bond portrayal does. It's worth a look, though.",negative
"Bond is really back with Craig... much better than Brosnan, but not better than Connery, this movie puts 007 back on the tracks...",positive
Don't think of it as an action-movie; think of it as a Bond film.,positive
Daniel Craig turned out to be better Bond than I expected. Nice performance of Eva Green. Loved the poker game:),positive
"My favorite Bond Film. Took the place of ""Dr. No"" for me--although I haven't given up on Connery--I am just eager to see the next Bond Film (out in July '08) to see what Daniel Craig has up his sleeve. He certainly has the chops. :)",positive
one of the best Bonds ever.,positive
"I thouroughly enjoyed this movie. I think Daniel is an excellent bond, and a wonderful actor. It went a little long, but hey, it was worth it. Such a good film.",positive
"A lot different than the previous Bonds. A little more gritty, less humor. Overall, pretty good.",negative
"An interesting reworking of the Bond series, but a tad on the long side. However, refreshing to see Bond portrayed as a cold-hearted killer rather than an eyebrow-raising joker.",negative
So much product placement it makes you want to leave in protest. The image of 007 has been stained in my mind.,negative
daniel craig is an amazing bond...very good.,positive
best bond movie i have seen.,positive
"[IMG]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/movie/gallery/1159328/photo_28_hires.jpg[/IMG] 7.75/10 Director: Martin Campbell Starring: Daniel Craig, Eva Green Kicking the series into high gear once more while leaving room for solid acting and good storytelling, Casino Royale is the best Bond film since the glory days of Sean Connery's run. Daniel Craig steps up to the plate big time here, and while he differs in many ways from the previous Bond personalities, he does capture both the seriousness and the comedy that made the James Bond character so special. Craig's got a big more bite than what you would associate with Bond, but he makes sure to include enough charm and boyish wit to make a fully rounded character. The general plot is both a breath of fresh air and somewhat lacking. On the positive, the plot is much more rooted in realism and doesn't involve villains with convoluted plots to take over the world. On the negative, Casino Royale lacks a central villain which was a detail I felt mandatory for a Bond film. The action is top notch, which includes a very impressive free-running chase scene. Though, the film does seem to lose some of its energy towards the last third of the movie, the entire resurgence of the Bond franchise and the performance of Daniel Craig make Casino Royale more than a worthy chapter in the Bond library.",negative
Undoubtably the best Bond since Sean. Craig takes the #2 spot against all the critisim and Campbell recreates Flemmings first Bond outing that is perfectly reminiscent of the original books tone. Just brilliant.,positive
Daniel Craig rocksz as Bond!,positive
"Great action, a good reflection and insight of the protagonist's inner thoughts in the early days working under 007 status! Daniel Craig's portrayal of the character is really impressive. I borrowed the DVD from a friend and I still want to see more of it! Three Disc Collector's Edition is indeed a treat with all the goodies BTS featurettes!",positive
"Finally a bond with balls of steel...figuratively and literally. Daniel Craig gives us a Bond that we can finally care about one that feels pains but still gets the job done and kicks some major ass while doing it. Gone are the smug one liners and the absurb action set pieces which is quite a positive. Daniel Craig has done what nobody thought possible, he has wiped the floor with every actor who played Bonad before him and made the character his own. I can't imagine anybody else playing Bond. A must watch.",positive
"Daniel Craig a pleasent surprise. A more dark and gritty bond, with ball torture!",positive
I'm not sure if this is better than Sean Connery. To say this guy is not bond is like saying the guy in Batman Begins is not Batman. He is a different version of the same guy and what's great is that this guy is awesome.,positive
KOOL! way better then the other bond movies...a bit too long though. but i wasnt conplaining.,positive
"People doubted Bond after Pierce left the scene, but were these doubters put to shame or what?! Daniel Craig was excellent as Bond,â¦James Bond! Craig really brings back the toughness and arrogance of past Bonds (Sean Connery). Pierce was elegant, but Craig is what the Bond franchise desperately needed. A martini-hatin', manhood sacrificin' badass! And Eva Green was a picturesque delight as well. The plot was well structured, the stunts, especially at the beginning, were an adrenalin rush, and the locations were beautifully shot. I highly recommend this movie for strictly entertainment value.",positive
Possibly the best James Bond movie yet.Set when he first becomes a 00 agent...magnificent.,positive
"This was so much better than I expected. It totally reinvigorated the Bond series, and Daniel Craig is amazing!",negative
I didn't expect Daniel Craig to be a good Bond like most but I was proven very wrong. It does have that good old Ian Fleming familiarity back and thats a good thing.,positive
"Finally, a good Bond movie again",positive
We need a real James Bond~ where the hell is Sean Connery?!!,negative
C'est pour moi le meilleur de tout les James Bond. Surtout a cause du jeu d'acteur de Daniel Craig qui est absolument efficace et de la realisation de Martin Campbell qui nous donne un Divertissement de haut niveau. La scene en afrique est absolument epoustouflante. Un film a ne pas manquer.,negative
"i thought i would hate it because the guy does not look at all like bond, but it was actually very good. plotwise, it does not fit in perfectly with the rest of the series, but it is still a great movie.",negative
"yes! this movie surprised the hell out of me, my fav bond movie!",positive
"That scene, where they smash his balls... Fantastic.",negative
I didn't feel that Daniel Craig got very into his role through out this entire movie. His acting always just seemed bland and mechanic.,negative
New and improved bond.never be as good as sean but good effort,positive
I loved this movie. Personally I think it was the best Bond Movie. :),positive
This was so disappointing. Daniel Craig was an unconvincing 007. It really doesn't compare to the Connery Bond films. Those are positively the best ever.,negative
Excellent re-imagining of the Bond franchise. Daniel Craig breathes life back into the character.,positive
Best Bond film ever made. The film and the Bond that the books dreamt off.,positive
"Craig is not bad as actor, but I miss the real James Bond atmosphere in Casino Royale. More action scenes and action effects, but less humour and typical British tongue-in-cheek replies.",negative
not bad. but dont like craig's acting as bond. Eva is great though,negative
This is one movie that you must see. Out with the old and in with the new.,positive
I didn't think Daniel Craig could fill these shoes but he did and this was an exciting Bond movie!,negative
James Bond grown up style. Still some of the old cliches but definitely watchable. Especially Mr. Craig!,negative
good film!! i think daniel craig is sexy!!,positive
great james bond film but it goes on a bit and the end is kinda cheesy.,positive
"Having never seen a Bond film before, I was very impressed with the strong story and acting in this movie. There was a sense of grounding that kept the movie from running off into insane spy-tech land and it doesn't have your perfect happy ending (otherwise there wouldn't be any sequels, would there?)",positive
"It's good, but seems to get progressively worse with each viewing!! Daniel Craig will, I'm sure, grow into the role, but he's trying too hard here. Relax! And stop trying to be Jason Bourne!! You're James Bond dammit!! The lovey dovey bit completely got on my tits. Did they really need to spend that long on establishing that he likes her? They didn't spend that long on the courtship between Bond and the woman he eventually marries!!!! And, dear God, what was that dialogue all about? More of a man in your little finger etc?? Please!! I challenge anyone to find anything else THAT cringeworthy in a Bond film! Overall, it's good, but not great. Hopefully, the next will be better (as long as they don't try to copy the next big thing - the Bond version of Atonement perhaps)",negative
tooooooooooo coooooooool,positive
This film is excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"Hard hitting, viceral, tense and a very distinct lack of cheese, this is bond unlike any other, and exactly how it should have always been. Brilliant.",positive
"One of the best Bond movies in years - which isn't saying much. DC is a good Bond but takes things too seriously. I'm not a hug Bond fanatic but I like the old formula - you know what to expect and all the trademarks were missing here. Given that this the prequel to all Bond movies, shouldn't it be set in the 60s? Great action sequences but a ropey script and acting.",negative
i must admit was reqally impressed with film defo pick the right Bond here!! feckin LUSH,positive
Bond is back..No silly unbelieveable stunts. Back to the days of Connery. Hurry up November 2008 for the next one,positive
Best Bond film in years,positive
Okay - I've waited over a year to say this. I stopped myself because I didn't want to commit myself too soon - how would the movie play twelve months down the track? Is it as good as it really seemed that first (and second and third) night in the cinema. But the time has come to put my chips on the table and show all of my cards - 'Casino Royale' is the BEST BOND EVER.,positive
Best Bond film ever!!,positive
It was good but a little to long for my taste.,negative
This is the best Bond movie ever! Daniel Craig was born to be Bond.,positive
Awesome. Fantastic.,positive
"That free-running scene at the beginning was sick. I also like the grittier, brawler-style James Bond in this movie a LOT better than the ...""cheeky fellow"" of the others",negative
"I don't usually go for blonds, but who's looking at his hair? Ay yi yi!",negative
I just wish it was a period movie,negative
I don't wanna sound gay or anything...but you could get lost in this man's eyes. My favorite Bond movie.,positive
"Great action and smart dialogue. Besides, there's plenty of eye candy for men and women. Isn't that what you expect in a movie?",positive
Reminds me of some of the original James Bond films. It was a nice change of pace.,negative
"Truly is the best Bond movie ever! I love Sean Connery and all, but Daniel Craig really is the greatest, and believable, Bond.",positive
"movie was entertaining, stylish, with good action, and kept you entertained though i felt it a little predictable",positive
Excellent all round. I will miss Pierce Brosnan but I am really looking forward to seeing what Daniel Craig does next!,positive
Excellent all round. I will miss Pierce Brosnan but I am really looking forward to seeing what Daniel Craig does next!,positive
best bond movie ever,positive
anuva hottie called daniel craig in n es well fit,positive
Meilleur James bond... Avant le prochain?,positive
"Considering I do not like Bond movies, I have to give this movie props. It was everything a good action should be.",positive
Du jamais vu!!! Cependant la chronologie des films Bond est rompue malheureusement,positive
"Terrific original James Bond film. Yes, I miss the gadgets, but this film was great....",positive
A perfect renewal of the Bond series minus the cheesy cliches and flashy gadgets.,positive
the softer side of Bond. I am probably one of the rare people that preferred Pierce Brosnan.,negative
Fantastisk! Fantastisk! Fantastisk! Bringer helt nye dimensioner til James Bond. Godt skuespil og noget sÃ¥ sjaeldent som handling i en James Bond film!,positive
Excellent! Daniel Craig is brilliant & breathes new life into bond!,positive
This for me was the best Bond film for years. Craig commands attention and delivers such a powerful performance that leaves you wanting more. He gives James Bond a human quality which has not been seen in any of the previous Bond Movies. The plot line is typical Bond and obviously inspired by the spoof Bond film of the same title but this by no means detracts from the quality of the movie this film gets a big fat five from me.,positive
although i don't really like action movies but this was nice,positive
a nice bond flick. i liked craig,positive
Daniel Craig is an amazing Bond,positive
were'nt sure whether i liked it when i first watched it but than thought it was really good,positive
Daniel Craig...que dire...;),positive
LOL RANDOM SHOTS OF THE BLACK GUY,positive
good movie revives the 007 series,positive
"I have seen every Bond flick at least a dozen times. I honestly thought the series was dead after Pierce Brosnan (not his fault, just poor scripts). This movie is an amazing comeback, and Craig makes the Bond character so badass. It's refreshing.",positive
"A good Bond film. Daniel Craig is a good physical pumped-up Bond wearing his heart on his sleeve. But he just doesn't look like 007 should do! Not as suave or as tall as his predecessors. Everyone thinks that Craig rebooted the franchise and made 007 more ruthless, vulnerable, dark, gritty and moody but it was Pierce Brosnan who did that. Still the action scenes are great and the film is as faithful to the novel as it can be.",positive
"I lliked it but it didn't seem like a bond movie,admittedly not as OTT as the last couple but it just didn't feel like Bond, and the lull as Bond recovers from his injuries seemed to slow the film down. Also, it seemed to have had a few inspriational fighting ideas from the Bourne films, how ironic is that? Still good but shouldn't have been labelled a Bond movie.",negative
"the best bond film made so far,with daniel craig being the best bond since connery.the action sequences were absolutely fantastic,especially the opening one on the building site,i really was sat on the edge of my seat.glad they have cut down on the gimmicky gadgets[they were getting a bit silly]although i did like mads mikkelsens performance,i think its about time we had a really memorable bond villain again.",positive
"For a 007 film, I found this to be a disappointment. Not in the same genre with most Bond films. For being in Madagascar to start.... I have my doubts. Unrealistic. Far fetched.",negative
Mmmmmmm Daniel Craig.....he's got gorgeous eyes..........,positive
Welcome back Mr. Bond,positive
"Ok, FINALLY we've gotten rid of all the WANKER Bonds and the CORNY, STUPID smart-alec one-liners of the untouchableness and absolute BS feats of impossible and ridiculous levels and got back to good JAMES BOND. Daniel Craig has restored my love of this Character - The 007 Agent. Thank you!",negative
Oh the torture tactics used in this are very painful to watch. My nuts are still hurting from that! LOL!,positive
"This was the best Bond film in ages, mean and moody, great action!",positive
"Monster movie and probably one of the best Bond films of all time. Daniel Craig makes the character really edgy and much more believable than Brosnan did. I really liked that most of the gadgets are also gone making the entire movie much more 'real',",positive
dis is a r8ting on wot ive hurd bout it but i im gona c it soon n c if every1 is right bout it,negative
ainoa hyvÃ¤ bond-elokuva,negative
"Mainly because Chris Cornell does the main title theme, but Daniel Craig makes bond more of a badass than he already was.",positive
"Best Bond film to date and also one of the best movies of all time, Shows Bond as he would have to be in this day and age, no need for smooth talking just smash the bad guys to bits and kick them again a little harder! hehe Daniel Craig in my mind is the best Bond by far give him a real human feel!",positive
"Dung dunga-dung-dung, dung dung.",positive
I had almost forgotten how badass this movie is. Craig is definitely the best Bond since Connery.,positive
This ain't your daddy's Bond! Daniel Craig has finally captured the Bond that Fleming wrote! Great movie! Can't wait for the next one!,positive
Best Story line build up for Bond.,positive
"Not nearly as stupid as the last several james bond movies. Still more unnecessary violence than I care for in a movie. Still, it captured me at times, and it truly is a step in the right direction for the Bond movies (even if I'm not the biggest fan of them).",negative
Truly great Bond Movie,positive
I just saw dis the other day for like the 10th time and i never get sick of it,negative
"En général j'aime pas les james bond, celui-là fait exception.",negative
This was pretty good; I was suprised.,negative
best bond since connery,positive
Daniel Craig is the best if not better since Sean Connery.,positive
One of the best Bond films. Daniel Craig is superb in his first outing as Bond.,positive
best bond movie to date,positive
"I used to love Sean, but Craig...He's MY Bond...",positive
I guess you could call this 'Bond Begins' as the Bond team take a leaf out of the Batman book of franchise reboots to give the series a much needed kick in the ass following 'Dire Another Day'. Daniel Craig proved all his critics wrong by simply owning as Bond. This film is fantastic. Case closed!,positive
Awesome movie with a young James Bond,positive
"Finally, a Bond film with teeth (no, not Jaws!). Can't wait to see another one with Daniel Craig. This is Bond bang up to date.",positive
I just LOVE that little Bond personnality...,positive
One of the best bonds in my opinion,positive
You thought You Knew James Bond. You Don't! See This Before you see Quatium of Solace!,positive
"The best Bond ever in the best Bond film ever, this is a great return to 007's roots after the disappointing Die Another Day",positive
Best Bond movie ever.,positive
"Best Bond film of all time. Daniel Craig abandons the suave, slick, gadgety Bond for a rugged kick ass and take no prisoners Bond. The storyline is contemporary and entertaining even during poker scenes. Shows how everything began as Bond becomes 007. Can't say enough about how good it is.",positive
The way a Bond movie should have always been,positive
"no gimmicks, just Bond beng ""HARD!""",positive
"In my opinion, best bond in years!!! Can't wait for the next!",positive
This was certainly one of the best movies I saw in 2006. Absolutely perfect Bond movie.,positive
Dosn't he pout alot!!,positive
"Many people comment how like James Bond I am, especially in a dinner jacket.",positive
Daniel Craig is a great Bond. He is the best Bond since Sean Connery. This film was a great reintroduction to the character.,positive
"I'm a little disappointed that they decided to restart the entire James Bond series, just because I grew up with the cheesy gadgets and campy one-liners delivered by martini-drinking Sean Connery. But I really like the style of this Bond flick; it sticks a lot closer to the style of Ian Fleming's novels than any other Bond film does. I don't care what other people say, Daniel Craig is an AMAZING Bond; anyone who has read Casino Royale should agree with me. He's more reckless and arrogant, which adds more depth to the character of Bond. The action was a tad slow in the middle and end of the film, but the novels were not always about action. Plus, this movie did teach me how to play Texas Hold 'Em, just like the novel taught me how to play Baccarat. Great film. Can't wait for Quantum of Solace!",positive
sucked just like i knew it would,negative
"Better than the rest of the Bond movies, but stil...",negative
"Pretty cool, probably the best bond movie yet!",negative
Loved the film and Love Daniel Craig,positive
"Best thing that happened to the bond franchise, all time favourite bond movie.",positive
First Bond movie I actually liked.,positive
bad actor to play 007,negative
Best movie of the year,positive
"very clever script, nie plot. good and quite realistic action for a james bond movie",negative
James Bond torna ma non convince.Troppo sentimentalismo e poca azione..poi Daniel Craig sembra fuori luogo...nettamente meglio Jason Bourne!,negative
Truly one of the greatest Bond films ever! Daniel Craig is superb and is very much like the Bond in Ian Flemings' novels.,positive
Everyone thought he was gonna be a rubbish james bond but he was very good,positive
en fantastisk begynnelse for en fantastisk helt. James Bond er her.,positive
"The first half hour alone is almost an apology for Die Another Day. A great mix of high-tech stuff and classic grit, something the best Bond movies have. Can't wait to see what Daniel Craig has to offer subsequent installments.",positive
"The BEST of the Bond films. He's roguish, accessible, and SEXY. And Eva Green nearly broke my heart with her vulnerable performance.",positive
Not as disappointing as many had led me to believe. the new bond does have a certain character of his own that lives up to the tradition,positive
Just plain cool. Liked Daniel Craig's work and believe he could be one of the great Bonds of all time,positive
a blue eyed blonde haired bond? he just might make me lust for 007's again,negative
"This, in my opinion, has the best James Bond (played by Daniel Craig). I think this was the best Bond movie of the franchise!",positive
Better than i anticipated,positive
Finally a BOND movie that doesn't put me to sleep. They've put the gay spy gadgets away and replaced them with an action packed karate chop to the fuckin' neck! This is BOND AT HIS BEST. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,positive
Really good Daniel Craig is an amazing new bond,positive
Best 007 actor yet....the future of james bond looks good....Tis is the first installment with Daniel Craig...watch it,positive
As a fan of the books its good to see a film that stays close to the plot and Craig is perfect as the ruthless killer who has yet to lose all his feelings for queen and country,positive
"This succeeds first as a fresh start for the Bond franchise, and second for being an all-around great film. The acting and story quality is top notch, and retains the tried-and-true grit, realism, and delicious spy-work that is only found in the best and most classic of Bond films.",positive
welcome back bond franchise...we've missed you,positive
The best 007 movie since Sean Connery.,positive
"Great. (Thank you, you may all subscribe to my reviews now)",positive
At last Bond has got balls.totally back on track with an excellent daniel craig delivering his acting chops in spades.,positive
"Ok, so i prefer the seriousness now, but what about the lack of girls man... come on....",negative
"Very Good, but still cant compete with sean connnery films.",negative
not as good as the others but i liked it,negative
Best Bond film since.... Well its the best lol more close combat please less gadgets,positive
This film proves that Bond isn't stale and by-the-numbers... at least not anymore!,positive
"- Shaken or stirred? - Do I look like I give a damn? Repliikki kuvaa hyvin taman elokuvan Bondia. Brittibondin sijasta leffassa haarii stereotyyppinen jenkkisankari, jonka yhteys aiempiin Bondeihin on liki olematon. Perusmattoa. Pettymys.",negative
i kind of thought this movie was rad.,positive
parts of this were pretty far-fetched; but all-in-all in was a pretty good 007 movie.,negative
"A brilliant start to the Bond legacy. Craig's version of the unrefined 007 is magnificent, and leaves you as hurt as he was at the end. It's Bronson meets Bond.",positive
"Who ever said James Bond could not be blond ? Great film, great actor, Bond rocks like a vodka !",positive
nothing speciel good action movie but not in level like the best james bond movies.,positive
"Wit, humour and style! ...and a real man, Sean Connery-style. A must see!",positive
Best Bond movie ever and Craig pushes Connery for the best Bond ever.,positive
LOS OF ACTION and you are always at the edge of your seat,positive
Best bond movie. hehehe hot girls still there.Eva Green <3,positive
"I rather enjoyed Pierce Brosnan, but this guy did okay I guess.",negative
"this bond is great, casino royale is simply exciting and Daniel Craig plays Bond brilliantly.",positive
can you say ouch! The ending wasn't all that great though.,negative
One of the best Bond Movies Ever...,positive
Best James Bond Movie Ever. I doubt it will ever be this good again.,positive
This is the only James Bond movie I have ever like. Awesome and nonstop action...,positive
Bond is officially bad-ass again.,positive
"Might be the bst Bond movie I have seen, I like the Bond with an edge.",positive
"Definitely the best james bond movie since the old sean connery bonds. It's dark, it's gritty, hell, it kicks some ass. This was a direct response to the new darker spy films of recent years such as the jason bourne franchise. The scenery is great in the movie too, and the music scoring is perfect for any kind of european spy film. speaking of which, the opening credits were probably the most entertaining of any bond film made. ok, so daniel craig may be blonde with blue eyes, but his portrayal of a darker bond was excellent and the tension he built up with le chiffre was thick enough to cut with a knife at the poker tables. with craig at the helm of a new kind of bond franchise, i cant wait to see the next one.",positive
The best bond movie yet.,positive
Reeaaally sexy and dominant Bond!,positive
Better than GoldenEye? I can't decide!,negative
Not bad for a running/shooting/fast car/pretty girl movie.,negative
"So much better than all the Bond movies that have come before it, despite Daniel Craig being a dirty blonde. He added a layer to the character that went beyond the typical skirt-chasing spy.",positive
"amazing, but cud be better",positive
"Complete re-make of Bond franchise - new fancy car, no rediculous equipment, no girl scenes, all improvements. The scences that let it down, include Bond chasing a villian a leaping tall unconstructed buildings! Moving in the right direction, but no quite realistic yet.",negative
"bond is back, can't wait for the next installment",positive
Buena mas no excelente... siento yo que le falto ese algooo... mas sin embargo no me quejo! Buen giro!,positive
anyone who thought Daniels would be a bad Bond should hold their heads in shame. the best James Bond movie since the days of Connery.,positive
i have see it on school,positive
vooral voor de actie,negative
DECENT ACTION SCENES!,negative
almost too good to be a bond movie..Daniel Craig has defnitely silenced all his critics with his perfomance...man has added another dimension to the charachter,positive
"its bond, and have you seen thoses speedo's? what else can i say",positive
A great new Bond for the next 10 years,positive
Everyone loves 007 don't they? Well Daniel Craig is rather nice to look at. Great stunts.,positive

I grew up in the Roger Moore era, with [i]Live and Let Die[/i] being my favorite Bond film for a long time. I re-watch his Bond films now, and they're terrible, he's way too hammy in them. Connery of course is the man, his movies, despite being older, hold up much better than Moore's. When Pierce Brosnan took over in [i]Goldeneye[/i], I fell in love with the series again. But again the films quickly devolved into brainless action flicks, with little of the charm of the old ones.[/font] [font=courier new]I was ready for a new Bond. I saw [i]Casino Royale[/i] when it was originally released and fell in love yet again. Daniel Craig's Bond was much more methodical, he acts the way you would expect a professional killer to act. It's not a perfect film by any means, but it just might be the best Bond film to date. [/font] [font=courier new]I like that the action scenes are more grounded in reality; Bond actually seems to feel pain. He loves the women, but seems to have a little more respect for them, actually treating them like people. I'm excited to see where they take the Bond series with Craig. I hope that they keep his harsh edge, and the more realistic action scenes. I'm afraid that we'll soon be back at another [i]The World is Not Enough[/i], which I couldn't stomach more than once. [/font]",positive
"I am a hug Bond fan and this one is my favorite. The past Bonds were great, but this one was so much more polished, not to mention Eva Green is so hot.",positive
Such a fun James Bond movie... the girls never do well in these though.,positive
"I was skeptical, but I have to say one of the best of the Bond movies. I like the darker side.",negative
"Daniel Craig is the real Bond, Hands down. He brings everything that Bond was, but also shows us a side of Bond we had never seen...an emotional side.",positive
"It certainly wasn't the re-invention of the Bond franchise as I had been led to believe. It was as good as any of the others, but nothing made it stand out from them. What it comes down to is terrific action and a trite love story - standard Bond fare. I thought the love story was going to be stronger...",negative
Daniel Craig was a superb Bond; I hope that he is able to do more Bond films,positive
"Some good action- but got bored by the fact that the new bond is basically just a killer- no intelligence, no finesse. Not really my type of Bond.",negative
Fabulous action flick.,positive
Great movie! I like his new Bond... James Bond aka Daniel Craig,positive
"Wasn't expecting to like it, as there hasn't been much to watch with the Bond genre since the Connery days. This was great, for what it was, fantasy in the world ofespionage.",positive
craig is good in this one.quite good though,positive
The best Bond movie in a number of years. The potential for the future of the franchise is very evident.,positive
"best bond movie i have seen. take all the stupid crap out of the previous bonds, make it more beleivable and you have casino royale",positive
"Daniel Craig rocked, and I did not expect it. Hell, I didn't think Bond could be revitalized into like...good movies again. Bravo!",positive
"Sean connery was the best bond, hands down, fuck this new guy.",negative
forget the rest Daniel craig is the best bond,positive
Completely revived James Bond.,positive
"So hard-boiled and so much more convincing than the other Bonds. Great action, suspense, stunts. Especially stunts. Cars, guns, women, glamorous settings...what Bond is supposed to be and forgot a long time ago how to do. Craig is awesome. Best since Connery.",positive
I'd always HATED all Bond movies with a passion but this was a good one. It showed the more humane side of Bond.,negative
One of the best action movies in a long time. Craig is class but Brosnan is still my fav.,positive
"Best Bond ever.I didn't even care about James Bond before I saw this movie, it's that good.",positive
the dark side of James Bond. finally. None of the stupid jokes from the Roger Moore-era and a Bond who looks like the coldblooded killer he is.,positive
"Action kicked butt, but Daniel Craig is too weird lookin to be bond.",negative
hate it... probably the worst James BOnd movie ever made (next to octopussy),negative
Is the franchise saved? If the next is this good....,positive
Without a shadow of a doubt its the best Bond film I've seen. Daniel Craig makes a crackin bad ass Bond!,positive
As good as it was Daniel Craig lacked any of the essential humor of Bond.,negative
Phoarrhh! Daniel Craig is a bit of alright!!!:),positive
Best bond movie in a while. They went back to the basic... less HI-TECH.,positive
og de sa at en blond Bond aldri ville funke.. pÃ¸h!!,positive
"Phwoar!!!!!! need i say more, what a man - if only he was real!!!",positive
"Why all the fuss about Daniel Craig? This is Bond as he always should have been - dark, edgy and utterly ruthless. Great stuff!",positive
Loved the movie. It proves there is still life left in the Bond franchise.,negative
The best Bone in a long time.,positive
This is unlike any other Bond movie that you've seen. It shows the dark side of James Bond... perhaps the real side as it should have been depicted long time ago. I really enjoyed it.,positive
"Becoming of the agent 007. Definite movie to watch(atleast if you've not seen any Bond movies, start with this one)",positive
I've never been a Bond fan but this movie rules!!!,positive
If only Paul Haggis hadn't worked on the script. I still like it. Poor Eva Green someday someone will take advantage of her acting talent and not just her looks.,negative
Best Bond film ever.,positive
"I don't usually like bond movies. The dialog is much better, and it visits a human side of him that doesn't exist in the other movies.",positive
When I first heard Daniel Craig was going to be the next James Bond I was worried but my fears were put to rest within the first 15 minutes of this film. This is a great re-boot for the Bond franchise. The Bond character was becoming too much of a caricature and this movie changes that. I can't wait until the next Bond movie!,positive
daniel craig totally changed my perspective of bond. love it!,positive
"Hands Down, best Bond movie I have ever seen!",positive
"By far the best Bond movie yet. Far surpassing any other I've seen (not that many really) Although Daniel Craig is a really good Bond, I personally think Pierce Brosnan suits the role better. I mean, Bond is supposed to be this incredibly stunning guy with a very charming personality and lots of gadgets. Although the gadget part was the film-makers fault, the other things were better with Brosnan. I mean, Daniel Craig is good looking and has a great personality and stuff, but c'mon. Thinking of it, I cannot think of anyone more so than Brosnan. As for the movie, this was a near perfect Bond experience. Would have given it 4 1/2 or even 5. But it lacked the 'Bond' factor. For me, more than a Bond film, this was just an amazing action film. But all in all a must watch for all action movie lovers.",positive
"Bond version 6.0 kicks off with a winning reinvention of the series. Daniel Craig is a tougher, edgier 007, one who's more credible in action scenes than some of the earlier Bonds. The initial action set-pieces are decent, but when Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) appears, the film really takes off. The scenes with her and Bond crackle with intensity and wit; she's one of the best Bond girls in quite some time. Overall very good . . . but if they've run out of Ian Fleming material and are starting to remake the old ones, does that mean we'll eventually see the Daniel Craig version of Moonraker???",positive
Best Bond movie since Goldeneye,positive
alot better than is was expecting. plus u found out why he is like he is!,positive
"Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond, and has some incredible stunts.",negative
the best james bond yet!!,positive
I have all the bond dvd's and this one rates highly..,positive
An awesome movie and further proof that it is possible to breathe new life into an ailing franchise.,positive
Love the film but not crazy about the actor.,positive
"A truely great James Bond, i think it's the best so far and i have always been a Bond fan. This just took up a level and then some.",positive
It is about time they did Bond right,positive
Not what I expected. Enjoyable.,positive
"The real James Bond. 1/2 star less for Eva Green, the most boring bond girl ever.",positive
"james Bond reprend des couleurs, cet production était nettement supérieur à celle vu avec Pierce.",positive
"clever and exciting....yay!!! if ur into bond, check it out",positive
"new james bond but back to the old school action - fantastic boiled down hard core kiss my nuts action film - basic bond, better bond",negative
legend of a film. absolute quality.,positive
"THE best Bond film, dark, dramatic and dangerous! Bond makes it to 00 status with a double hit in Prague, Czech Republic. Bond moves on to Madagascar and shoots up an embassy, before breaking into M's house and following a trail of terrorism to The Bahammas. A couple of games of Texas hold em, a bottle of Bollinger later he is off to Miami to stop a bomb going off! What a guy. All round top class film!!",positive
Best Bond movie in awhile,positive
"Ok, Bond is not one of my favourites, but his films are entertaining, besides Daniel Craig is so hot in this film!",negative
One of the best James Bond movies ever made.,positive
Wooohoooooo! James Bond has been revamped again and this time he's really serious.,positive
Best Bond-film since GoldenEye,positive
one of the best bonds (SO FAR!!!!!!) :-):-),positive
Best Bond Movie since the Roger Moore Era!,positive
great but kinda wierd,positive
"I was a non-believer that Craig could pull off a good bond, now I'm a believer. A great reinvention of Bond from the first few minutes of the film to the very end!",positive
DANIEL CRAIG says it all what a body :D,positive
"From the beginning of the movie, you are on the edge of your seat.",positive
Interesting view of how James Bond becomes James Bond.,negative
NEED BETTER JAMES BOND,positive
"Daniel Craig does solid job and helps the series regain its status as best ""agent movie"" franchise.",positive
"Typical ridiculous Bond stuff and overly long but wow, nonstop action!",negative
The new james bond gave a new meaning to a spy and the stunts he performed are an extreme for any bond movie.,positive
I just like it sooo much.. <3,positive
"Wow, I wish they would re-make all the Bond movies like this, all I can say is Wow, it's nothing like the old James Bond movies!!",positive
"""Casino Royale"" is to Bond, what ""Begins"" is to Batman, Craig is the perfect Bond, profiecent killer, and doesnt rely on the damn pp9. down right hand to hand ass-kicker, mind you i am watching this for the 100th time as i am righting. Great reinvetion hope to see more",positive
Best Bond so far. No cheesy lines. Must see.,positive
really died in the second half. Yawn.,negative
"Daniel Craig was a good choice as the new Bond, and some of the action set pieces are great, like the free-running at the start. However, I thought Eva Green was a major let down as a Bond girl, with far too much make-up, and sullen expressions. This movie also suffers from the fact that the book it is based on never really had much of a plot. And what the hell was the point of the collapsing building at the end? However, the final scene was fantastic, and left me with a good feeling leaving the cinema.",negative
"Falls apart in the last half hour, but Eva Green is hot",negative
"Casino Royale, in a similar fashion to Batman Begins, reinvents an established mythos and adds humanity, emotion, and grit to a story we all thought we knew. This is the Bond film for people who hate Bond films.",positive
Yay a Bond movie that isn't the same silly crap.,positive
This was an awesome Bond movie. WAY BETTER THAN PIERCE BRONSON.,positive
"Each actor brought something to the James Bond character and Daniel Craig is no different. This movie has less special effects which works really well. Overall, I would rate this as one of the best Bond movies.",positive
"The Bond reboot brings him back to reality, away from the sillyness of the Brosnan years. The ending is very realistic too.",positive
"Did not like daniel craig as 007. I know, I know...I'm the only one!",negative
"Crazy little miracle that Craig got to play Bond, he was a risk for the franchise, but the perfect actor, and in the best script they've had in decades, with great stunts.",positive
I think this may be the best Bond movie yet. Daniel Craig's abs got a standing ovation from me. My goodness that man is beautiful.,positive
mmm love those eyes..,positive
"HyvÃ¤ Bondi ottaen huomioon etten yleensÃ¤ niin niistÃ¤ vÃ¤litÃ¤. TÃ¤mÃ¤ on tullut nÃ¤htyÃ¤ kuitenkin jo parikin kertaa. Onnistuneet nÃ¤yttelijÃ¤valinnat, mielenkiintoinen ja hyviÃ¤ kÃ¤Ã¤nteitÃ¤ aina toisinaan. Vauhtia jne.",positive
"Brilliant. Just Brilliant. Just the way I like my Bond movies, shaken, not stirred. ^^",positive
"James Bond is a jerk. I didn't find his roguish antics charming at all. He's disrespectful to women and has little regard for other people's property. Seriously, not my kind of movie. I was hoping for something less campy and formulaic, but Campbell didn't stray too far from what everyone expects from a James Bond movie. I can't fault it for being a Bond flick and it being tied to the original source material, but I was hoping they were going to reinvent the genre like Batman Begins did to a large degree. There was too large of a disconnect between Bond's ruthless killer personality and a largely cartoonish world of poker playing, cat-stroking villains and consequence-less violence . I zoned out the last 30 minutes when the plot gets convoluted. In retrospect I should have skipped this one.",negative
Unstoppable and action packed.,positive
Daniel Craig is really good as a young Bond. And quite sexy too!,positive
"Pretty good, wasn't sure what to expect with a new Bond but overall was entertaining.",positive
The best Bond movie ive seen yet.,positive
major surprise. I loved it.,positive
"There's not been a decent Bond film in years, to the point where I stopped bothering to watch the most recent ones. Even the 60s/70s/80s ones have dated pretty badly in comparison to modern actioners, but then this 'reboot' as they like to term it turns up with an admittedly flawed- nobody bats an eyelid when Bond returns to the Poker table even though at least Le Chiffre would have expected him to be dead- movie that hits my 5* rating due to the awesome initial chase and for being so much more than I had expected. The next one should be good too... btw looks awesome on blu-ray, a reason to buy a ps3!",positive
"Not as good as the old Bond movies, Sean connery is the best Bond.",negative
"after 1 hour and 45 min I was thinkin' - ""when is it over?"" - still descent, and i like the new Bond's personality. a ruthless bad-ass killer.",negative
I thought Bond had really started to go down hill until I saw this. Pierce Bronson is like an inbreed autistic retard compared to Daniel Craig.,positive
"Surprisingly excellent - much grittier and more realistic than any previous Bond film. Supposedly truer to the books, but I never had the patience to read and Fleming.",positive
"""let me be daniel's whisky"" (b.) - yeah, says it all, I guess ;-) doesn't hurt, but is great fun to watch - so, all you should expect from a james bond movie.",positive
"Not really a James Bond film in the classic sense, but still a pretty good action flick.",negative
Daniel Craig is very dishy,positive
"Daniel Craig was excellent in his debut movie as James Bond! Excellent, just excellent! The only thing that would have made this movie better, would be if they added more of the gadgets that define a Bond film!",positive
Vicious gadget free Bond. I like it.,negative
Although much better than the brosnan bond movies still it's a bond movie...and really not that good. Perhaps I was expecting too much...,negative
The best Bond film yet--with Bond the way he should be: Smart but tough...,positive
"it was great, i almost cryed when his car blow up",positive
Le meilleur des James BOND depuis sa recontre avec Dr No...,positive
"The working man's Bond. The cold, ruthless, confidence hiding a sentimental, love sick puppy inside.",positive
It is a cool movie ....,positive
"Really good. Daniel Craig is probably the best Bond yet (although the role he plays is very different from any other Bond, so it's kinda hard to tell).",positive
Good Bond film but he is no Sean Connery.,negative
straight out of the book,positive
"definitely the best bond movie i have ever seen. They have changed bond from that cheesy poster boy image that brosnan was flirting around with and turned him into a cold blooded assassin. Craig does a great job as bond and though a LOT happens too fast in the end, but all in all a great movie.",positive
"So I finally watched the whole movie after over a year, and I'd say it was pretty good. He wrecks the car like usual, the girl dies as usual, overall a pretty good prequel. I'd like to see more from Daniel Craig.",positive
"After the travesty that was Die Another Day, Casino Royale is a fine return to form. And Daniel Craig makes a fantastic Bond.",positive
I liked it. A great surprise to see Daniel Craig do a good bond. It makes a nice change to have a bond that isn't afraid to use his fists rather than a multitude of gadgets like Die another day.,positive
Paras Bond tÃ¤hÃ¤n mennessÃ¤,positive
After this film I became a Bond fan..and fell in love with Daniel Craig!! Love it!!!,positive
craig is a great bond!,positive
"S'inscrit bien mal à titre de James Bond, mais excellent film d'action tout court.",negative
"Best Bond movie so far. Goldeneye was the shit, but this one is slightly better. And Daniel is the best Bond ever.",positive
"Best Bond movie yet, original script too",positive
A deconstruction of James Bond that works. It is about damn time.,positive
"Ver esta pelicula fue una experiencia bastante particular para mi, asi como para muchas otras personas por las reviews que he leido. La razon: habiendo visto muchas peliculas de Bond, Craig le da al personaje un caracter radicalmente distinto de lo visto anteriormente, asi como una profundidad al personaje, tampoco antes vista. Una pelicula llena de accion y trama, que nos hace preguntarnos donde se situa la historia respecto a la vida de Bond: antes o despues de las aventuras anteriores. Un Bond con mucho musculo y pareciera que poco cerebro, aunque bien entrenado. Es como ver renacer a Bond. Llena de accion y el correspondiente romance, la pelicula posee pocos momentos de tranquilidad, lo que nos permite estar constantemente entretenidos y espectantes. Es recomendable para ver.",positive
"I finally watched Casino Royale, and was very pleasantly surprised. Gone are the nauseatingly cheesy one-liners and overly choreographed fights. This is Bond at his grittiest. It's also the first one I've seen that doesn't have girls in the opening animation. I'm now a Daniel Craig fan.",negative
"a total different bond - edgy! the middle of the movie was a bit long, but definitely worth watching",positive
"Daniel Craig, le renouveau de Bond !",positive
"Kerrankin hyvÃ¤ Bondi, paras mitÃ¤ olen nÃ¤hnyt.",positive
Best Bond film so far... I'm looking forward to watch more of blue-eyes Bond.,negative
"Casino Royale tuo 007:n lahemmas Ian Flemingin romaanien paahenkiloa. Elokuva on aikaisempia osia realistisempi (vakivalta sattuu oikeasti), ja esittaa paahenkilon kylmana tappajana. Pokeriturnauksesta on saatu tehtya elokuvan kliimaksikohtaus, mika on hienoa sekin. Huumoria on vahan, ja sekin kohdistuu etupaassa aikaisempien osien korneihin elementteihin. Nayttelijoista Daniel Craig on odotettua parempi ja Eva Green odotetun mitaansanomaton.",negative
Absolutely fantastic! Mamma sto inglese....... Fantastico comunque!!,positive
"I am a die hard Pierce fan when it comes to Bond. I went into this movie and even came out of it resenting the fact that he was no longer Bond. The move times i watched it, however, I came to realize this is not only my favorite bond movie, but one of my all time favorites. The action is SO much more believable, and the character is someone you can see doing this job in real life. I have even gotten over his being blonde. See this movie, and if you don't like it, see it again, you will. ""The bitch is dead.""",positive
"Very Very Very good movie, Daniel Craig did an excellent job at potraying James Bond, they picked the right person for the job.",positive
Bring back Martin Campbell. Clearly there is no other man who knows how to deliver Bond like this man. Bond begins.,positive
"Great action, some unneeded stuff.",negative
"best bond movie ever! daniel craig is the best bond, sean a close second",positive
"I didn't know what to expect, but I knew Daniel Craig is a good actor. Craig's performance adds some (much needed) depth to Bond. Solid movie to entertain you on a Saturday night....",positive
for me one of the best james bonds ever!!,positive
I've Seen every James Bond movie and Craig made this is one of the best yet....can't wait for Bond 22 Nov. 2008,positive
Bond is now beefcake and Daniel Craig is never entirely believable as 007. The movie is overrated.,negative
He's not Sean Connery...but close enough,positive
"I liked it, but it was WEIRD that this is supposed to be the BEGINNING of James Bond, and yet it's set AFTER all of the others, in terms of technology, etc. TOTALLY wonder what Tomi would have thought of it.",negative
"good film, but it wasnt quite bond was it?",positive
all james bond movies kick ass. this one is no exception. good opening song too,positive
Who knew I would like Bond movies?,positive
it ends so sad. but i like this james bond. he's pretty schaweet.,positive
"It was really good.... a lot darker than the other movies though... plus bond is a little less of a ""player""",positive
"was excellent, free-running, real fights,bond dies then re-awaken by the hot eva green! Bond was getting worse and worse then this happened! :)",positive
"Craig wasn't as impressive of a Bond as I had hoped he would be. The spy aspect was almost entirely removed, I was hoping for a better inflitration perhaps some more gunning. I'm a fan of the older more tactile James Bond. That being said it sitll was not a dry film by any means.",negative
This is how bond should be seen,positive
Most likely my favorite movie at the moment. Brilliant acting and plot. Can't wait for more!,positive
I can't believe it but I really enjoyed this movie.,positive
Went 2 See This When It First Came Out..Its Greatt,positive
BEST JAMES BOND MOVIE. Eva Green= Best Bond woman ever.,positive
Best Bond hands down!!!,positive
Lots of action....little long for my liking. Still very good.,negative
"Daniel Graig as James Bond, wau! I really haven't been a bond fan, but now looking forward to the next one.",positive
"Excellente cette nouvelle franchise, Daniel Craig est archi nice Ã©galement. Dommage qu'il y ai pas plus d'action, genre une vraie poursuite avec l'Aston Martin Ã§a aurait pas Ã©tÃ© de refus. Mais sinon j'aime bcp le cotÃ© "" humain "" du nouveau Bond, vivement la suite :)",positive
"Finally, a good Bond! Daniel Craig did such an amazing job with the character of Bond",positive
"Best Bond ever! I love Daniel Craig as James Bond, he's perfect for the role, and I've seen almost all of the other James Bond movies. This movie is much more realistic than the other more recent ones with Pierce Brosnan. I can't wait for more of Daniel Craig as James Bond!",positive
la mejor pelicula de james bond que he visto!,positive
This is what James Bond was meant to be like. Daniel Craig is the perfect fit.,positive
"Don't compare the Bonds from different eras / the new Bond is what we've been waiting for though... instant, classic action film.",positive
worth it for him coming out of the sea with his speedos on!!!!,positive
Good film yes. Good Bond no.,negative
Edgier with less reliance on gadgets - good film,positive
He's a really good bond! :D i thought he would be crap!,positive
"I was skeptical about Daniel Craig playing Bond because I have always associated James Bond with Pierce Brosman; however, Craig did an excellent job portaying the character of James Bond.",negative
"The quintessential James Bond is back. Finally a movie that showcases the spy, and not Hollywood's ""look what we can do"" motif. Daniel Craig plays the best Bond yet.",positive
A more dark and sinister Bond... I like it !!!!,positive
huonoin ikinÃ¤ ewer....,negative
Love Daniel Craig..great action,positive
The best bond movie of all time!!!!,positive
"Another great Bond installment with Daniel Craig showing that he is a true 00 agent, with yet another great story and cast.",positive
Amazing opening scene.,negative
"Daniel Craig's performance in this latest Bond installment silenced most, if not all, critics who thought he couldn't fill the shoes worn by Pierce Brosnan, Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton. Watch it, and you'll see why.",positive
My favorite remake 007!,positive
was so looking forward to this but its just too long and the casino scene goes on too long. YAWN,negative
"I'm going to say it: Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever. This is the reinvention that the series needed after the latter Brosnan films dragged the series into oblivion. It receives the obvious comparison to the gritty realism of the Bourne series, but sets itself far enough apart to be extremely enjoyable. A bit of a stretch of an ending absolutely does not sink it. Very much recommended.",positive
007 all I have to say,positive
"not my favorite james bond, plus this guy is no pierce brosnan, who is the perfect bond, period.",negative
Introduces Daniel Craig as Bond very well. Excellent action and storyline.,positive
"Daniel Craig breaks the Bond image, but I must say that he does a good job. The writing was certainly better than the last several films, but if I can't stand to watch poker on ESPN: I certainly can't spend half the movie watching him play cards.",negative
"With a new director and Daniel Craig debuting as the lead role, Casino Royale takes the Bond series in a fresh direction. Filled with sleek new gadgets, exotic locales, fast cars, gorgeous women, and plenty of cheesey sexual innuendo (after 30+ years, you should know by now what you're in for), Casino Royale is innovative in that it does not rely on these elements as much as past films. Darker and more action-oriented a la The Bourne Trilogy, Casino Royale offers a pleasantly riveting portrayal of Bond's early years while maintaing classic 007 charm.",negative
Great way to restart the Bond franchise!,negative
"Very cool, new James bond. I love it!",positive
Yay! The villians are realistic and Daniel Craig is smokin'! Hurrah for the first blonde Bond.,positive
best Bond movie I've ever seen. And best reboot of any franchise too.,negative
"After seeing Casino Royale, I decided Daniel Craig to be my favorite James Bond ever. Not really the typical english gentleman style, but he looks powerful and very convincing in his role. The movie is full of thrill and action. Enjoyed it a lot.",positive
"One of the better bond films, I think.",positive
"A franchise is reborn, and not soon enough. I had stopped caring about the Bond movies, but am reinvigorated by this latest entry.",positive
This might have to be my favourite Bond movie now.,positive
"This was a good movie. I'm not sure what to think about the new, darker being of Bond. At least Bond has now inner conflicts and is much more interesting character.",negative
"The best Bond film ever. It's a little tricky trying to follow the plot sometimes when they're talking quickly, but that just means you ought to watch it again--and that's a good thing.",positive
Fy faen so bra den e!,positive
"A nice turn for the Bond series, definitely inspired by the successful bourne ones I presume. Still, Jason's far much better. Plus you get to hear extreme ways on the end :P",negative
Daniel Craig did an awesome job. Very entertaining,positive
"Amazing Bond movie! I loved it, it was thoroughly interesting and very action packed. Looking forward to the next one!",positive
"UM...duh...if your reading this to decide whether or not to watch, you could easily diagnose a mental issue. THE HIGHEST GROSSING ONE YET AND EASILY THE FUNNIEST!!!!",positive
"BÃ¤sta James Bndfilmen som har gjorts. Bra, genomtÃ¤nkt och en bra skurk. SevÃ¤rd",positive
"Im not a bond fan, but this one won me over. The begining is pretty good for a laugh, then the movie just hooks you in.",positive
Craig bring back Bond an possibly saves the franchise.,negative
"Same story, different bird boring!",negative
Unlike typical 007 movies this one actually had a little charactor development.,positive
paras bondi vuosikausii,negative
Daniel Craig and Eva Green are v. good,positive
"A brave rebirth of the Bond character. Campbell and Craig pull of a great movie with plenty of action, amazing stuntwork and very good soundtrack.",positive
"That's a new style they're exploring here in the James Bond series, and it made it great! Much more emotion in that movie than the others, but the car chase... sucked. Thankfully the parkour chase was a refreshing asset.",positive
Daniel Craig is pretty good. This movie itself was well written. I like the new direction of the Bond era.,negative
DANIEL CRAIG.....need I say more?,positive
"Sooooooooo good, I loved it.",positive
jotenkin ne vanhat bondit vetoaa enempi. mut ei huono,negative
"Is it 2006, or 1966?",positive
"Hi there Mads Mikkelsen, you're rather creepy!",negative
Did not think i'd enjoy this going into it but thought it was sensational. Daniel Craig was much better than I thought and really liked the whole thing.,positive
"I liked it way more than I thought I would. Good twists. Funny, also.",positive
Craig redefines James Bond...,positive
"Disappointed when Brosnan ditched, but this is a very brave ""re-birth"" of Bond which works for me, a big fan of the novels",positive
"Eva Green is gorgeous, and Daniel Craig is hot. Enough said.",positive
"Holy crap this movie's awesome. Bond gets worked big time and we see why he never allows women to get too close. Awesome action, great story, and they play poker too! Sweet!!",positive
"Casino Royale is my favorite film of all time because it gracefully beat every single one of my expectations. Daniel Craig is 007 exactly as I would imagine the character to be. Despite 44 years of existence as a character in films, James Bond never felt real until Casino Royale.",positive
"I love Daniel Craig. Surprisingly, I enjoyed watching the movie as well.",positive
I'm just not a 007 fan.,negative
"A Bond-reboot that's much better grounded than the Brosnan-era films, but sharing their sophistication. Let's face facts: all old Bond movies are crap (watchable crap, but crap nonetheless). 90s Bond started strong with Goldeneye but became unmoored (perhaps a uniquely bad choice of adjective): the threat and menace lost reality. Here, Bond is grounded: he suffers real pain and has real weakness. My favourite Bond film. For the first time since the disappointment of The World Is Not Enough, I can add the words *so far*.",positive
"As much as I liked the Pierce Brosnon-era Bond flicks, they really were just the same formula: take a megolomaniac villian, add a few absurd gadgets, a mcguffin with the potential for world-domination, a bunch of tiresome innuendo and puns, an over-the-top scifi-inspired set piece or two, shaken well, and presto. This movie has none of that. The humor, the heart, the intrigue, the exotic locales, the cleverness, the hot love interest, and the action remain, but a welcome dose of reality, roughness, grit, and intelligence that has long missed. An excellent movie, and I can't for the next one.",negative
Quite simply the best Bond film in years.,positive
What a great way to restart an icon in the movies.,positive
"A blond Bond? Yep, and it works! Daniel Craig's portrayal of 007 is the most realistic of the bunch. Bravo! :)",negative
the best James Bond film ever.,positive
"Best of the Bond Films ,... hands down. Got a bit sappy with the girl but I, loved the departure from gadgetry and never having a hair out of place",positive
"Pretty good, one bit inthe middle that I find a bit odd, and the beginning is a bit unbelievable, but is IS a Bond movie",negative
just an awesome movie all around even if it wasn't a Bond flick. this is basically what Batman Begins is to the 007 franchise.,positive
"Daniel Craig is a new Bond, blond, and more Hollywood, but definitely no worse than some of the others.",positive
not bad for a Bond film. Craig a little too mush macho a not enough gentleman.,negative
"La mejor de James Bond, el personaje es mas real y humano, le falta eso a todas las secuelas",positive
Great re-imagining of the classic role. Really great movie and Daniel Craig was amazing,positive
It's Savage!!! One of the best if not THE best,positive
"Un mec, un vrai. Brut et sensible. IndÃ©pendant et amoureux. Bond... James Bond... trÃ¨s bon.",positive
One of the best Bond films,positive
"Very good Bond. Daniel Craig was much better what I expected before the film. Extra points for that ""amazing gadgets"" were left away.",positive
the film was good and the beginning showed wot the new bond would b like. Hes a bit to uptight in this one but the action scenes made this very worthwhile watching. Still not sure with Craig and was annoyed that he only did bonds catchphrase once at the end.,positive
"Craig isn't Bond. The overall movie wasn't bad, but he will never be Bond. Ever.",negative
best bond in AGES!!!,positive
"I'm not a fan of James Bond but this movie definitely changed my mind about that. Daniel Craig is absolutely amazing and the entire film had my heart racing. The music, the action, the stunts, all the elements of a great action flick (with a touch of bad-ass charisma).",positive
"I love the new Bond, he's still suave but looks like he could kill someone",positive
"An entirely new take on the Bond mythos, which leaves the continuity a bit shaken (ie. If this Bond wasn't in the Cold War, why does he have the same boss as the one who was?). It's not trying to measure up to its predecessors as much as try something new, in which it succeeds, but fighting an uphill battle against the expectations raised by the last 20 Bond films.",negative
"wasn't to keen on a new bond, because of my love for Pierce Brosnan...but Daniel Craig definitely is 'Bond' material!",positive
"Easily one of my all-time fav Bond flicks. Daniel Craig was just awesome. Nobody beat's connery, but Craig is either 2nd, or in a tie with Brosnan. The action was great, as well as the lines. I LOVED the line, ""No! To the left! To the left!""",positive
I was one of those who said that Daniel Craig will be the death of a franchise... and I am still amazed by how brilliant the new interpretation of 007 turned out to be.,positive
Daniel Craig! Daniel Craig! Daniel Craig!,positive
"Daniel Craig acts his way into the role of Bond, even though I think that he is miscast for the simple reason that he lacks the appearance of refinement. I cried out in despair when he crashed the DBS.",positive
je crois que je l'ai vu au moins 12 fois!! He is so hot !!!,positive
"So they got rid of that mincer Pierce Brosnan, ditched the invisible cars, and drafted in even classier girls. Simple but oh so effective. Daniel Craig is awesome - pretty fit, too. I almost turned gay.",positive
un james bond ultra crédible et humain...,negative
"Smart, passionate & invincible... Three words to describe the new Bond man!!! A wonderful combination to make a superb Bond Movie!",positive
"I enjoyed this movie, because for the first time in a long time, James Bond was not a fruit and kicked serious ass; loved the line about the martini - ""does it look like I give a damn?""",positive
top 3 among bond movies along with goldeneye and goldfinger,positive
A great jump start for the character/franchise.,negative
"NO ES EL BOND IDEAL, PERO EN FIN...",positive
Best of a good bunch I think. Will definately be watching the next serving!,positive
Three words: Bond is back!,positive
daniel craig is NOT bond,negative
"Daniel Craig did not disappoint. I loved this movie, especially all the twists.",positive
cAsiNO royALe LopH u,positive
"Like this Bond film alot because I think that Daniel Craig makes a mysterious, believable Bond. The storyline was good and the action and nice cars were still there. Kinda sad but the story makes his cold, suave, player personality more understandable (for the other movies). A good prequel to the others.",positive
"ooooo Daniel Craig coming out of the sea with those shorts on! yes please, again and again",positive
A new bad ass has arrived.,positive
Bonds finest movie to date,positive
"I loved this film. It's probably one of the best 007 films ever made, and Daniel Craig makes the best Bond ever (Yes, even better than Connery). Also, the storyline of the film was excellent. It was great to see how Bond becomes Bond.",positive
"I should mention first, I am a die-hard bond series fan. That being said, I have very mixed feelings about this one. I love the more realistic feel of this one. The action was great (especially the brutal fight scene in the bathroom). It had one of the better theme songs and introductions. I was very skeptical of Danial Craig when I first heard he was to be Bond, but I think he played the part nicely. I can understand why they would want to reboot the franchise with their previous release ""Die Another Day"" being among the worst of the series. This is just the the kind of kick in the butt the franchise needed. They were becoming more about the women, gadgets, and cars then Bond himself. So, a film which focuses on how he became a double O agent was a good choice. However, this one falls into the same trap as as all the more recent Bond films; it tries to analyze the character and find out what makes him tick. The people in charge of the franchise need to realize that Bond is a legend. He is awesome in every way. However, when you try to show why he is the way he is, it makes him seem so much less cool. For example: It's no longer, ""Bond is so cool, he doesn't need women, yet he can get any girl he wants."" Now it's, ""Bond was betrayed by the only girl he ever loved, so he can't trust women anymore."" Another problem with it, is it screws up the time-line in the series. There were several unneeded, and sometimes unwelcome changes to the series (Not to be a misogynist but what's with the woman M? Me and all the other Bond fans were hoping they would go back to a male M since this is a prequel). However, it is a step in the right direction. Just stop analyzing Bond and making changes to the set formula of the series, and this may become a great franchise once again.",negative
It may not seem like a Bond film at first but Daniel Craig owns Bond by the end of this film.,positive
bond reborn (thank goodness),positive
not the best bond ever but good,negative
Great movie. Daniel Craig is so much better than Pierce Brosnan.,positive
this bond idk about him bond is more pimp hes like got a pencil up his ass or something to uptight! and bond never loses his first time in casino's!!,negative
AWESOME! Daniel Craig is beyond Yummy!!!,positive
The best Bond film in a long time. Daniel Craig is the 2nd best Bond behind Sean Connery.,positive
Some of the best action of 2006.,negative
TOTALLY AWESOME HATE ACTION MOVIES EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE,positive
I'm a Sean Connery girl myself but the blue eye did it for me. I'm hooked.,positive
THE best Bond ever!!!!!!!,positive
2 words...Daniel Craig,positive
"Just the kick in the ass the floundering Bond series needed. Takes it back down to reality, which I enjoyed. This is not to say that I don't like the gadgets and all that in the other Bond movies, it's just a refreshing change. And not only all of that, but it's a great movie in its own right.",positive
Brilliantly constructed with the heart in the narrative of James Bond rather than stereotypical blowing things up and action.,positive
brilliant new modern version of james bond young and sexy cant get any better than that,positive
Great action sequences and a much better story compared to the last few Bond movies.,positive
I usually don't like Bond movies but this was good. The stunt work will impress you the most! A must see!,negative
i've seen this 100 times,positive
Daniel Craig makes an awesome and very hot James Bond.,positive
The best James Bond film,positive
The best James Bond film ever!!!!,positive
not the greatest bond movie.,negative
this is my first Bond movie witch i really like:),positive
My fav of all the james bond movies,positive
Excellent update to the Bond series. Daniel Craig has the deepest and most interesting take on the character yet.,positive
A good comeback for Bond from that diabolical die another day!,positive
Action packed. Daniel Craig is James Bond cool. Eva Green is real hot. The action sequence in Uganda is so awesome. It loses a star for the faux ending.,positive
i`ve never liked much a bond film but this one is a real spy movie awsome acting and scenes not to say the opening theme,positive
"This was a surprize as to how good this was. Like most I was unsure if Daniel Craig could pull this off. This film has blown a breath of fresh air into the genre. Some great stunt work and superb storyline, if you can get to watch this on Blu-ray do so as this is a visual treat.",positive
i totally loved this movie. i need to get it on blu ray disc,positive
Gave james bond back its edge,positive
Oooh those blue trunkies !,positive
"To my mind, the better James bond.",positive
Thank God - at last an enjoyable Bond movie!,positive
"Was very impressed by this, Daniel Craig is a much better Bond than Pierce Brosnan.",positive
A Good Bond film... but not the best,negative
"Daniel pouts and stares his way through the movie,i expected and half wanted to hate it as i wasn't sure about the NEW bond....but he was brilliant. A must see.",positive
"Just when we were giving up on 007 after the Roger Moore style Die Another Day (I'm talking A view to a kill Moore, not Live and let die Moore...) they do what everyone thought impossible and breathe life into James Bond. Me, I never doubted Daniel Craig after watching him and Christopher Eccleston in Our Friends In the North all those years ago on TV. I liked the last Jason Bourne movie, but you need to watch this again to see who does free running stunts properly. Nobody, truly, does it better...",positive
It for sure pulled the series out of the hole brosnon dug,positive
Don't usually like Bond movies BUT this is FANTASTIC it has nothing to do with Daniel Craig in his swimming trunks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"If you're looking for a great action flick, then this fits the bill. But if you were expecting a better James Bond than Sean Connery or Roger Moore, then you'll be disappointed.",negative
"Back to basics.....no CGI effects like in the last movie. Daniel Craig - excellent..... I was a bit worried seeing as there was a lot of speculation of who will be cast in the role of 007 after Pierce Brosnan... ...and of course Dame Judy Dench as ""M"" - what a brilliant actress - especially in this role - this role really fits her like a glove. I look forward to ""Bond 22"" coming in November '08 I believe.",positive
best Bond movie ever! Daniel Craig is so hot. Love it,positive
The best 'raw' Bond film ever made!!!! Based on the first Ian Fleming Bond novel ever written this has Bond earning his classic '00' liscence to kill and has one of the best chase scenes on foot that you'll ever see!!!!!,negative
"Kanonfilm. En ovanlig Bond-film eftersom det var handlingen som var det primÃ¤ra, inte jakter och vÃ¥ld. Som alltid en hÃ¶gklassig produktion.",positive
"aweful aweful aweful... no plot, he's not a james bond at all, and she couldn't act to save her soul.",negative
Daniel Craig... need I say more? I didn't think so!,positive
I was so skeptical about Daniel Craig but he pulled it off in a big way and I thought the story line was great,negative
"Welcome back, James!",positive
Watched this one on a plane! Daniel Craig did the Bond role splendidly :D Action/Sex/Thriller ! whole package,negative
Bonus point for Eva Green.,positive
Best bond flick ever. Period. Craig / Campbell nail the true Bond dichotomy; the cold-blooded killer you want to sleep with.,positive
one of my favorite bonds yet!,positive
its not the best of james bond.,negative
I had really low expectations for this movie as I'm a classic Bond fan. I was happily very surprised.,positive
The best Bond I've ever seen!!,positive
"I expected not to like Daniel Craig, but was pleasantly surprised by his take on James Bond. Looking forward to more...",positive
Action-packed and so sad~,negative
This was really good! The best Bond-film ever made. It was so well done and Daniel Craig was just the perfect man for the job. Great storyline and some amazing action sequences. Really cool movie.,positive
Best bond movie to date!,positive
"quite a stratch ,i know , jumping like superman and playing poker, but who cares he is damn ""attractive """,positive
"I like this particular Bond, but i don't know, wasn't crazy about the movie despite some very good scenes. Eeh.",negative
explosif et trÃ¨s speed! GE-NI-AL,positive
"A little torn on this one. It was really good, but does an action movie need this much time devoted to poker?",negative
"I dont consider it a bond movie, but its still cool",negative
daniel craig is a wicked bond,positive
Much cooler and realistic Bond.,positive
"very good, kept me wanting to watch more!",positive
i lv this its the any 1 i watched caus i lyk daniel craig hes got a fit body n all lol,positive
The reinvention of James Bond! And a parkour chase in a construction site! It's so cool...,positive
"An action packaged addition to the Bond series that works on every level. It is a great Bond action movie perfectly acted by the new comer Daniel Craig, wonderfully scored by Chris Cornell, and actually very well written. It also explains a lot as to why Bond is the way he is with both women and his job. I found myself excited about the action and for the first time I saw a real emotional connection between Bond and the Bond girl. This Bond film still has the flash, action, and joy of the others, but pulls me into it in ways the others didnât. All it all Incredible movie, great acting all around, and awesome theme song!",positive
best bond film since goldeneye,positive
"There was a whole hour in the movie where no one was shot and nothing was blown up, and that's just wrong for a James Bond film.",positive
"This flick is very good, i LOVE the opening sequence, the chris cornell title song, the chase around madagascar, then off to miami international. All in all great flick.",positive
One of my favorite movies of all time,positive
Bringing it back to it's roots... Hasn't been a Bond this good since Goldfinger,positive
"I really enjoyed this bond film is funny, it makes him look human. thoroughly enjoyed",positive
hmmm Daniel Craig er en av mine favoritter. I like,positive
"Excellent portrayal of Bond and might actually be the best depiction from the novels. However, I absolutely hated that they inserted ""Texas Hold'em"" into the movie for the final card game... it just seemed so trite and ridiculously shameless and makes you wonder if they just used that game to take advantage of the popularity of the game in our current climate.",positive
"Oddly structured, but still the best Bond.",positive
"Daniel Craig kicks ass and digs down and dirty in a post 9/11 apocalyptic tale of terrorism,poker and yes...dirty martini. Of course he finishes it in the best way possible..""The name's Bond...James Bond""",positive
I usually hate Bond movies. But they finally found a Bond that isn't a 5-year-old school girl in a metrosexual British man's body. The first Bond worth my time.,positive
"I had stopped watching Bond films a few years ago, but the previews looked so good, I had to give this one a try. Wow, what a great decision. I wish they had cast it as a period piece, but it would not have been the commercial success CR was, and Bond movies are all about commercial success. Still, it was a great thrill.",positive
"enfin un james bond qui n'a pas peur de se prendre autant de coups qu'il en donne... plus sombre plus intense et plus proche du personnage dorigine.. il etait temps. Craig is Bond, james Bond",positive
A bit different from other bond movies. Bond actually does something besides just picking up girls.,negative
"Best Bond since Licence to KIll, though the last 20 minutes is a bit of a let down.",positive
How sexy is Daniel Craig?,positive
danil craig makes a fantastic bond!what a sexy bod!,positive
"Am happy to see a bond movie which the creator (broccoli) could finally be proud of. Else, after his death, all that came up was junk!",positive
Best James Bond movie so far..,positive
meh i ve seen better,negative
"Incredible! Don't compare this to classic Bonds, it's a reboot like Batman Begins.",positive
"When I first saw the torture scene, I laughed my balls off.",positive
"Best James Bond film by far! Daniel Craig played the role perfectly... from his blunt, hard character to his HOT performances of action packed nerves!!!",positive
"Not as good as a lot of people make it out to be, but it is still very solid. My main gripe really is just the length - it's 144 minutes and it really feels like it. There were a lot of things that really just didn't interest me and it made everything continue to drag. The entire poker scene, while fun, is just so ridiculous and cliched; it seems to last forever. On the good side however, is Craig, who turns out to be an excellent Bond. This is one area where they undeniably made the right choice. As for everything else, I don't know, it just never really grabbed me in a way that I wanted it to. I admired the technical aspects, yet was bored through most of the length.",negative
"Bond done better on so many levels, the new standard.",positive
Craig is the second best Bond. Connery is still the best.,positive
best james bond film,positive
"Daniel Craig gives the performance of his lifetime in a raw, original, action packed new spy classic: Casino Royale. Bond is back for good.",positive
"I love Daniel Craig as Bond. Much better than the later Pierce Brosnan films. This movie shows Bond's beginnings, which explains why he is who he is. I also appreciated the lack of cheesy puns. Such a relief!",positive
was kinda boring at times origanls are better but this isnt that bad,negative
"Danial Craig displays a new, fallible, impatient and impeccably bad ass Bond. The action, intrigue, thrills and seduction never stop exploding from the screen to your face. Too bold? Too bad. This latest Bond's got a lot going for him now and he's not going away.",positive
One of the best of the new generation of Bond men.,positive
"A very pectoral Bond prequel. The best Bond of the past 20 years, he's bonafide sexy meanness and not just cufflinks-n-gadgets.",positive
Not onew of my favorites. Love Daniel Craig but this was missing the glamour of older bond movies,negative
"The best of the recent Bonds, especially the casino sequences.",positive
Pretty entertaining....but perhaps I was just happy to take in a english language film while in Argentina. A bit graphic on the violence,positive
hats off! brought back to some realm of belivabilty. loved the opening scene! best ever.,positive
"Best Bond Ever, Daniel Craig Rocks!!!",positive
One of the best Bond movies to date.,positive
"Didnt have the feel of the regular bond, seemed unrealistic at least the first half of the movie, and didnt have as many action packed scenes as I would have liked..not the best movie ive seen but at the same time not the worst",negative
Everyone seemed to love this alter-ego Bond film. I didn't love it.,negative
Probably the Best James bond Movie ever!,positive
"Not a fan of Bond movies but Craig is good and Eva just to hot,",negative
What a ride. It starts fast and ends fast. I haven't been entertained from a Bond movie in quite some time. Nice to see a rough-around-the-edges Bond that sets up all his other films and how his character developed.,positive
kind of slow moving for an action movie. i was actually kind of bored for parts of it. all the other james bond movies are action packed non stop from start to end. this one was a snore.,negative
Best Bond film yet and I have seen them all.,positive
"Excellent! Eva Green was a bit weird, though.",negative
"portays a more ""realistic"" bond",positive
Lieblingsszene: Dusche (schmelz..),negative
"I had no intentions of liking Daniel Craig as James Bond... until I saw it. He shot right to the top for me! Gritty, edgy and so much deeper than those tongue-in-cheek Bond movies. Loved it!",positive
Yummy!Daniel Craig is the best Bond to date!,positive
Decent plot. Fine leading man ;-),positive
"i expected more, however daniel was great in it.",negative
Great movie and a very down to earth Bond!!!!Movie's best thing:Green playing Vesper!Just perfect!,positive
"I enjoyed this film, could have done with a few more catchy one-liners and sophisticated gadgets to be a bit more Bond-like.",negative
Probably my favourite 007 movie,negative
Back to the proper Bond at last.,positive
"Loses some of the suspense if, like me, you don't know how to play poker.",negative
Esta pelicula es lo mas cercano a los libros de Ian Fleming,negative
worth seeing slick and fun,positive
"Best Bond ever - no strange gadgets, straight up action and good story. Very faithful to Ian Flemming's novel - This movie is shaken and not stirred",positive
OH MY GOSH! This was a GREAT movie!,positive
The new change of pace for Bond was a great decision.,positive
I like the darker James Bond - a lot more serious than the other films which was refreshing.,positive
No soy amante de las peliculas de accion pero esta me encanto; la interpretacion de Daniel Craig como el agente 007 es impecable y acertada.,positive
"a tired franchise, new actor or no,",negative
"I don't want to empathize with my superheroes. I don't want them to be flawed or believable as 'real' people - why is it taken for granted nowadays that this type of character should be the aim of a good movie? Does this make sense? Movies such as the Bond series are entertainment, and they have no right to aspire to anything more. 'Casino Royale' shows why. By my standards, the new Bond is a disappointment - he's a brooding, uninteresting killer for hire. I think this is just as much a contrivance as a James Bond who jets around in a submarine car, beds a different woman in every city, and always has a vaguely clever one-liner at his disposal - the difference is that this heavily-contrived version of the character is considerably less fun. It's still Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan for me.",negative
Suprisingly good and brutal,positive
Daniel Craig in teeny-weeny speedos. What was this film about again????,negative
"The hottest Bond ever!! Had my reservations at first, but OMG!",positive
"Brilliant movie! Completely different from any previous Bond movie and it's all the better for it. A gritty, bloodied, harder Bond is what the franchise needed so Daniel Craig filled the role perfectly. I love how the movie ties in with the other movies tho, he makes mistakes, it shows how he comes to not trust anyone, all the good stuff, and no stupid gadgets, jus fast cars and beautiful women. Bring on Bond 22",positive
"though Daniel Craig is not my favorite Bond by a long shot, this movie brings a new element of depth and perception to the series. edgy, suspenseful, and action-packed with the standard contemporary savoir-faire with a hint of classic charm. a perfect modern adaptation of Fleming's first novel. and Eva Green's just plain sexy.",negative
"Just when I thought the franchise is dead, or feeling tiresome, Daniel Craig channels out his gravitas to make the character breathlessly sexy, and believable.",negative
best chase scene in beginning!!! wow!!!!,positive
"I haven't seen all of the James Bond films, but I can't imagine any of them being as good, much less being better than this movie. Casino Royale really shows us Bond as a human being not as the womanizing wise cracking unlikely person he has been in the past. It's also got a love story between Bond and Vespa (the gorgeous Eva Green) that's as emotional as any romantic movie that's been released lately. Amazing from start to finish.",positive
AWESOME made me realize how much of a bad ass Daniel Craig is.,positive
Loving it. Good to see class back in the saddle.,positive
"People might critique the casting of this Bond, but while he might arguably not be the best Bond, this is definitely the best Bond MOVIE.",positive
"Excellent Bond film, though much darker in tone and less focused on gimmicky gadgets and tricks. Daniel Craig looks to carry the franchise for a long time. And Eva Green's pretty hot. Looking forward to the next entry in the series!",positive
A very adventurous movie,positive
"Even with the way-too-chatty love interest and the cornball dialog about love armour or whatever the fuck they were talking about, still the best Bond film by a mile. Daniel Craig muscular, no-nonsense Bond is a welcome breath of fresh air.",positive
"i wasn't originally interested in james bond nor the james bond movies, but i loved this one! eva green is absolutely gorgeous, but i think pierce brosnan is still the hottest bond of all.",positive
One of the best bond films I have seen!! Action-packed and entertaining all the way through.,positive
The Best Bond Film next to From Russia With love.,positive
"I liked it, but the original Bacarat game was changed to Poker... hmmm, it's a sign of the times",negative
I thought that the story was a bit weak ... which I wasn't expecting (I think it's based on a Fleming original). It all seemed to end half way through and we spent the rest of the time waiting for the love of his life to turn into a Fembot.,negative
"I saw many 007 movies, but this one is my favorite one.",positive
"What can I say, I love me some James Bond!",positive
generally not a bond fan. but this one i love,positive
Not bad for a remake.........but soooo different from original!,negative
"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen even with consideration of my excellent familiarity with all the previous Bond films. If I had never seen another Bond, I'd think only Daniel Craig could play this role. From the introductory sequences to all subsequent action scenes, the film only let's up occasionally and momentarily for a breather, while still maintaining the tension at the poker game. Absolutely believeable portrayals by all characters, with kudos especially to Judi Dench and Daniel Craig. An excellent film.",positive
I loved Daniel Craig after this movie,positive
"BEST BOND FILM EVER!!! did you see the free runnin scene? did you see the airport seen? did you see the torture (ouch!!!) scene? did you see when he shot mr. white at the end? basically royale was a reboot of the bond franchise that's y he was soooo.... wooden instead of smooth at the begennin but as the character develops u can see the bond we all know and love for years ooze out of daniel craig. great film, great set pieces, great film!!!!",positive
"not enough action, too much poker",negative
"Finally, a good story and great action without the fantastical, over-the-top stunts and special effects (remember the disappearing Aston-Martin and surfing a tsunami!...those were really stupid) that plagued the Pierce Brosnan series. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery, period.",positive
pretty frickin' great Bond!! i'm into the Blonde Bond...very.,positive
i like all the action in this film it well exciting,positive
A brilliant film. I think Daniel Craig may even be giving Sean Connery a run for his money as the best Bond. Here's hoping that the next films live up to the first.,positive
Campbell and Daniel Craig did a wonderful job of bringing Ian Fleming's super spy back to his roots in his first mission...,negative
"I'm not a bond-fan, but this movie was ok",negative
The Best James Bond Movie in years.,negative
I really enjoyed Daniel Craig as Bond better than anyone else!! The movie was great just a little long.,positive
the film is by far the best bond film. and the best film from 2006,positive
"One of the better Bond flicks of late. The last two Brosnan films were absurd, despite Brosnan being the most Connery-like Bond. Craig offers a fresh new look at Bond, as a brooding and dark character. His performance is powerful and makes this new Bond more edgy--and more believable.",positive
"Incredible revamp of the Bond series. I had doubts about Daniel Craig, but I think he nailed it. The feel of it is very different, too. Less cheesy, more intense.",positive
"OK, it's not just the scene where he comes out of the water, I like the cars too!",positive
"A movie which was surprisingly good. Perhaps without the gimmicks displayed in other Bond movies, this one was a breakthrough with full actions.",positive
"Very good action film, just doesn't feel very James Bond like?",positive
Another great Bond film and Daniel Craig was good in his first outing as JB.,positive
Dreadful - Craig was wooden and some of the set piece action sequences were gratuitous. Don't waste your time seeing this Bond.,negative
"Gripping, and I hate gambling. I think it was a touch long yes, but Craig is a great Bond, better than Remington Steele",positive
too long and had no clue what was going on.,negative
"pretty good, daniel craig has lovely blue eyes",negative
"I think Daniel Craig is far from James Bond, he doesnt handsome and naughty enough to play Mr. Bond, he even rarely smiling, unlike Mr. Bond I knew that always flirting, smiling and also a good agent, for me its a bad choices...but my father loves this movie lol",negative
Entertaining and good story,negative
OMG!!!! bring back Pierce Brosnan!!! he cannot pull off being bond!!!!,negative
One of the shittiest movies ever. This is basically an instructional video for playing Texas Hold Em for retards.,negative
great action... but the use of bond's car is not there so we miss that...but its really a good movie,positive
i liked his car but sadly he's just not bond for me,negative
"The best Bond film. Dark, with surprising twists and strong action.",positive
"The sexiest bond ever.........storyline good, action and Daniel Craig yummy!",positive
daniel craig is gorgeous x,positive
"A very insightful exposition of one of the most overexposed heros in modern film. Instead of focusing on the ancillary bric-a-brac, this film gives a searing study into the character of James Bond and what makes him tick.",positive
"Five stars, only because of him.. ;) Well, no. I am not a big fan of Bond's, but this was really entertaining.",positive
Heh... one of best no-frill no-nonsense Bond movies to date...,positive
he goes alright as bond. The bond girl is superb too,negative
Daniel Craig is freaking yummy in this movie,positive
"As fine a Bond film as has ever been made. The only flaw was its slightly turgid length. Oh yeah, and the visible kneepads on the guy he shoots in the knees toward the end. Otherwise, wow!",positive
new 007 nice body bond,positive
"Didn't like it, don't like Craig as 007.",negative
I liked this Bond movie except for the predictability.,negative
A fantastic re-boot of the series.,positive
far and away the best bond movie yet,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond i've seen so far.,positive
an amazing instalment to the bond famliy,positive
"A nice turn for the Bond series. A much more mature means of storytelling, which results in a very suave Bond and a more engaging storyline. I have high hopes for the next installments.",positive
i loooooved this movie. i seen every bond movie there is!!!,positive
"Not a Bon fan per se, but this was ok",negative
He makes a great Bond!,positive
"Hot men and women, cool gadgets, but it's a bond movie, so absurd plot lines, bad dialogue, and ridiculous, but they are fun to watch, and kick ass action opening!! Plus, Daniel Craig is my husband, so I have to support him a little.",negative
"I had my doubts about Daniel Craig, but they were completely shot down. Best Bond since the legendary Sean Connery",positive
sweet lord almighty.,positive
Slowly becoming my favorite Bond movie.,positive
Really Good. Bit Long.,positive
i thought this film sucked donkey dick.,negative
does daniel craig have unusually blue eyes or is it just me?,positive
Best Bond film in a long time,positive
WORST JAMES BOND MOVIE EVER MADE 9(except maybe moonraker) AND WHAT IS WITH THE BLONDE HAIR?!?!?!,negative
"Craig did a good job at filling in Bonds shoes, the movie really flows together well. Great movie. ""Now everyones gonna know you died scratching my balls!""",positive
"Recalls Timothy Dalton's Bond, more serious than schlock. Great opening parkour chase, but ""VESPER"" as a password is far too sentimental for 007.",negative
"i truly loved this movie , best bond movie ever, i actually understood it ;-) , + its funny",negative
"Average. Good acting and suspense, but pretty bad special effects and was very fakey, even for a James Bond movie. Although it was pretty long and boring at points, there were quite a few action scenes that kept your attention.",negative
"One of the best Bond's in a long time, relying on the actual character more than any gadgets. My -only- complaints were how quickly the car got totaled, and how there's some inconsistencies with the storyline now; although set before Bond even became a 00 agent, the film features technology which is most definitely of today. Making Dr. No, the next in the series then, seem a little.. dated.",positive
"At first I LOATHED the idea of Daniel Craig playing James Bond, but this movie definitely changed my mind.",positive
"best Bond so far, and man is he HOT!",positive
awesome movie daniel craig does a fantastic job,positive
awesome couldve been better though,positive
"Best Bond. Best Bond film. This revamped Bond is everything I could ever want in a Bond film. It's smart, it's witty, it's classy, has one of the best Bond songs, and it's realistic. This might be one of my favourite films as well.",positive
brutal!!!!!! el mejor james bonds de todos los tiempos,positive
jack bauer a la place de james bond ?,positive
Bond gets dark. 'Bout time Bond was as evil as his writen word counterpart..,negative
"Everything about this movie is awesome, including the opening theme by Chris Cornell. It captures the essence of Bond and turns him into a super-badass. I can't wait for a sequel.",positive
*heart flutters* LOL..really revived vision of Bond,positive
"WTF with the terrible, terrible Chris Cornell song?",positive
He's blond! Bond is BRUNET! WTF??? Can't find hair dye? Recockulous action sequences tho...,negative
a man in a suit and the aston martin...need I say more!,positive
Best Bond film ever? Possibly. Gives Sean a run for his money.,positive
"This film is fantastic! I make out i hate the bond films, but when i get into it, i love them! and thisd was pretty cool, so much mroe realistic than the others and completely action packed...WOOHOO! Daniel Craig was pretty good actaully, didn't expect him to quite 'hit it' as the character, but his acting was brilliant, and not at all wooden!",positive
"There's always talks of who's the best Bond, and everyone always says Connery because he had the most movies, but now I truly believe in quality over quantity. This is by far my favorite Bond movie, and one of my overall favorite movies.",positive
its good.The best bond in ages,positive
best bond movie of the lot,positive
"Every bit as suave, sexy, and explosive as a Bond movie should be. Daniel Craig is perfect.",negative
The best James Bond film ever.,positive
OH MY GOD!!!!!!! DANIEL CRAIG IS THE BEST JAMES BOND EVER!!!! JUST LOOK AT THOSE ABS!!!!! OH MY GOD!!!!!,positive
Best Bond after Piers Brosnan but too early 2 make a judgement.,positive
"Liked the movie, just not a ""typical"" bond movie",negative
Wow. Bond + Badassery = a new favorite.,positive
Best Bond film made.,positive
"A shot of adrenaline to the heart for the franchise, which had overdosed on its own excesses for the previous three movies.",positive
"Guns, gadgets, cars and poker. What else does a movie need? The opening chase scene is mind-blowing.",positive
"The best bond ever, shame on those Daniel critics, he bought the soul that was always lacking in bond. Can't wait to see the others.",positive
"Un james bond profond, sans trop de gadgets, tres classe, bref une reussite. Avec un tres bon David Craig, et une ravissante Eva Green.",positive
"Not normally a fan of Bond... but liked the grittier, more human style. Great chase scene to start it all off... didn't even get too bored in the lengthy poker game",positive
here's a guy i got to keep my eyes on,positive
loved it loved him....,positive
BEST JAMES BOND MOVIE,positive
"Not a very pretty Bond, but he gets the job done.. with balls of steel",positive
WELL THERE WILL ONLY EVER BE ONE BOND SEAN CONNERY AN DIDN'T EXPECT DANIEL CRAIG TO PULL OFF THE BOND ROLE BUT NHE HAS PROVED ME AN PLENTY WRONG THIS MAKES BOND MORE REALISTIC AN NOT LIKE ROGER MOORE WITH RAISED EYEBROW AN NOT A HAIR OUT OF PLACE IN A FIGHT SCENE THIS IS HOW BOND SHOULD BE,positive
One of the best Bond movies. Daniel Graig best Bond... so far:),positive
Finally the story was more important than all the fancy gadgets and stunts.Also Daniel Craig is an awesome Bond.,positive
good job breathing some life into this dying franchise,positive
Completely redefined Bond in my mind.,positive
Best bond movie since Licence to Kill,positive
"Freaking awesome, one of the best 007 movies, and Craig is by far the best Bond since Connery",positive
i fell asleep when i watched it (both times) but it was good,positive
"Before this, Golden eye was my favorite Bond movie. 10 minutes into Casino Royale I changed my mind.",positive
james bond is not longer a fucking macho!,positive
"The opening credits are bad. The song isn't sultry and there are zero sexy, femme fatale-type silhouettes bursting into flames/smoke/etc. I liked everything else.",negative
"Even though Craig is about as British as Nicholas Sarkozy, his hardhead style and stone acting make him a new tough guy. Not quite as sophisticated as Connery or Brosnan, but it doesn't matter. Verdict is still out whether he can live up to the name, but this is a worthwhile first entry.",positive
The most intelligent of the Bond movies. All the others cannot be taken seriously. Craig portrays a real man with a difficult mission. Eva Green is perfect as his foil.,positive
The most redefining Bond film since From Russia with Love. Daniel Craig's performance as the legendary 007 is absolutely epic. Highly recommended.,positive
"Didn't expect it to be good, but it ended up being one of my favorite Bond movies.",positive
A more mature and realistic vision of James Bond.,positive
well James Bond's again.,positive
"Umm, Daniel Craig, shirtless. Need I say more?",positive
"i watched it on a bootleg, that may have skewed my opinion. Not one of my favorite bond films, but definitely cool in that it describes the history of bond. I didn't quite understand the connection between him and Moneypenny, but i understand it much more than in any other of the bond films.",positive
The only Bond worth seeing. And it's really worth seeing.,positive
"OK, so I spoke too soon. this is the greatest Bond ever. he's such a badass and never cheesy.",positive
my nfavorite bond movie,positive
filled wid ego n emotions..i like ths bond a lot n he looks gr8!,positive
"I would say this is the best Bond movie thus far. I really enjoyed the whole movie from start to finish. The torture scene was...torture to watch, but very well done. I would recommend to anyone over the age of 14",positive
Savior of the series.,positive
i thought this was good.,negative
"my favorite bond film! the chase scenes are awesome, the storyline is well written, and for once bond has a real meaningful relationship with a woman",negative
The Best Bond movie I've ever seen! Daniel Craig is slick as a secret agent.,positive
One of the best recent Bond movie. Daniel Craig was alot better than i thought he would be to be fair.,positive
There's something about Craig that makes him perfect for the role of James Bond... the best in the seires.,positive
One of the more memorable James Bond movie. Great start for the new James Bond in Daniel Craig.,positive
"At last a bond film where the stakes are really high...after all, it does take place in a casino.. but anyway, this is very easily one of the best bond films out there.",positive
i hate james bond flicks and this was the exception,negative
"Daniel Craig is without a doubt the BEST bond ever! More realistic than any other bond movies, Has to be one of my all time Favs!",positive
"absolutely my favorite bond remake... and Daniel Craig IS 007. the best ever, and definitely easy on the eyes...",positive
"Enfin un James bond un peu noir. Le meilleur depuis Sean Connery, c'est peu dire. J'a ete tres surpris de la qualite de cet opus. Un seul regret, 007 ne meurt pas ....",positive
it wasnt half bad. i expected it to be horrible,positive
i like bond style.i think Danial made it right to deserve MR BoNd,negative
Mads Mikkelsens in it!,positive
"Ok action,laaaust basert pÃ¥ 007",negative
The Next Sean Connery!!!,positive
"The best Bond film in years. Some great action sequences, only let down by a weakish storyline. No witty oneliners or dodgy innuendo either..",positive
"Definitely better than the last 2 or 3 James Bond films. But, James Bond in a Ford (gasp)?",positive
Not James Bond - give me pierce or Sean any day,negative
What not to like = other than I didn't feel it was that 'BOND' - bit too much brawn - but then again this is the first one and when he is still learning his womanising skills! It will be interesting to see where they go with the next one - least he'll be scared for life now with a broken heart and much better for it!,negative
The most redefining Bond film since From Russia with Love. Daniel Craig's performance as the legendary 007 is absolutely epic. Highly reccomended.,positive
"i have to be honest here: i was one of those people fuming at the thought of daniel craig being the next bond. i loved ""layercake"" but still, blond bond? craig is too much of a wuss in the timotyhy dalton vein to pull this off. i know when i'm wrong because this movie was brilliant. it looks like michael wilson and barbara broccoli watched the ""bourne"" movies and realised they've been surpassed and went back to the drawing board. the result is a stellar addition to the bond franchise and daniel craig in one shot has already elevated himself to the conversation of where he stands on par with the immortal sean connery. quality performances are turned in throughout by eva green whom as vesper lynd, shows a new kind of bond female lead: one with sass but with an intelligence on par with bond. a refreshing convept after having had to be punished watching halle berry coast through ""die another day"" like she owned the film. dame judi dench as ""m"" once again shows her versatility and her greatness as an actress and jeffrey wright as felix leiter was solid as well in his limited appearance. the only flaw in the flaw i found was mads mikkelsen as ""le chiffre"". he wasn't as strong a villain as i would have liked but it is a minor quibble. for me the feast of the film is the opening tete a tete between craig and the free-runner, sebastian. incredibly executed stunts and tremendous athleticism were on display here. anyways, from a life long bond fanatic to you, watch this film. it's a great one.",positive
i love the whole Bond movies series dealio...but this isn't the best remake,positive
not a real bond film i mean he crashes an aston martin the gay ass,negative
Best Jams Bond Movie ever!,positive
"Definitely a good start in 007 movies for Daniel Craig. Just as good as Connery, but I think that for this Bond, there's too much ego.",positive
"Daniel Craig is without a doubt the best bond ever. And Casino Royal the best bond-movie. I cant see how they will make more bond-movies, cause this one is where it all starts.",negative
Habituellement les James Bond je trippe pas trop mais celui m'a vraiment fait tripper,positive
Haha... I mocked this movie from beginning to end.,negative
"Daniel Craig reinvents Bond? Bah! Forget attempting any seriousness in a Bond movie, I say. Give me cartoonish villains and a dialogue full of juvenile sex puns. Anyway, OK overall, just not spectacular.",negative
A two-and-a-half-hour commercial.,negative
"lookin for double o ""daniel craig is the man, playin the mind games is no joke.. lookin forward to the sequel in december",positive
"this is how i have been waiting for a BOND film to look like, no outrageous gadgets, or camp humour, lets hope they continue in this vein",positive
good but seen better bonds,positive
"I liked the story line but, I didn't like him as a Bond.",negative
Prefer the original...,negative
"Finally, a Bond that I can believe is a dangerous spy.",positive
Very cool film with brilliant special effects and gadgets to match.,positive
A blonde Bond???? Huhhh Nice fighting scenes that's all Pretty predictable!! Nobody can replace Sean or pierce!,negative
Best Bond movie in a looonng time.,negative
"Can't believe it took me over a year to see this, being a Bond fan. Very edgy, great sets and lots of typical ""Bond"" icons. But thought the plot was a little light and very shallow in any type of political or cultural themes (which I have enjoyed in recent Bond films). Craig's pout also annoys me.",negative
good. See the original instead,negative
Wats not 2 love about the 1st bond!,positive
"Beautiful action, a well-cast Bond, and my new favorite Bond-movie female, Vesper. The romance in the book is preserved and well-translated into modern times and onto film. It's everything I was hoping it would be. I'm a little surprised by that.",positive
"That chest, need I say more. plus never manged to sit through any othe if the bond films without getting v v bored",positive
Simply the best Bond ever Fleming will be smiling down to see 007 finally realised as written,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond so far!!!!,positive
Hottest Bond scince Connery,positive
"the action sequences are good, but the story is too long. Daniel Craig is what Bond should be gritty, relentless, and will do anything for HM and country",negative
"I really enjoyed this movie. Ever since Sir Roger Moore stopped being James Bond, I didn't really care for 007 movies anymore, but I'm glad I saw this movie. The action scenes were awesome, and the storyline was great as well. I'm looking forward to more 007 movies with Daniel Craig as James Bond.",positive
Pretty cool idea: a James Bond who is constantly screwing up. This one was way too long though.,negative
Daniel Craig gets my 5 stars just for the swim shorts :),positive
Mi favorita de esta serie.,positive
My affection for Bond movies went down a couple notches after I saw this.,negative
Pierce Brosnan was a pussy compared to the new Bond. Loved it!,positive
best james bond! daniel craig is grade-A hunk material!!,positive
Amazing. Reignites a franchise that was running on fumes. The last line of the movie (you'll know it well) is just perfect.,positive
Great movie but i think Pierce Brosnan was the best James Bond.,positive
one of the best bond films in awhile. more up to beat and modern.,positive
I love the new hardcore James Bond,positive
The best Bond flick in years; the awful double climax nearly sinks it.,positive
an excellent bond. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery. best action since Connery. Not many dumb gadgets either.,positive
Really really good. Realistic and violent compared to the cheese-ball fests that Rodger Moore put out. Sean Connery and Ian Flemming would be proud.,positive
The best Bond movie yet.,positive
"Daniel Craig's eyes in High Definition... oh, an a great Bond plot too!",positive
"Craig silenced the naysayers in this one, bravo to him...argueably the best since Connery. The parkour stunts are killer.",positive
Not as good as the HYPE portrays it to be.,negative
"I know one of my friends will kill me,as he really liked the film but to me it was average...there were a couple of subtly funny bits though.",negative
"Craig is the best Bond since Connery, and this film, unlike other Bond adaptations, follows the book quite faithfully.",positive
"A fantastic reimagining of the franchise, though I hope to see a return of some of the fun and abandonment of the previous films - the success of Bourne doesn't mean that Bond has to change...",positive
"The first Bond film I've ever seen, really good. I especially like the part where he's in the chair and the guy has a big rope with big knots...",positive
daniel craig=teh sex,positive
"BOND007! There hasn't been a bad one yet!! Okay, maybe The World Is Not Enough. Denise Richards should just stick to lesbbian scenes. There nearly isn't enough of them about! Who's with me???",positive
"Mr.Craigs finest hour...er apart from Layer Cake. No Sienna Miller, but Eva Green will do...",positive
Best Bond movie yet. A proper reboot to a bloated series.,positive
What a stylish bond! The story was somewhat more profound than expected.,negative
"Bond with a twist, not my fav, where's the guns on the Aston?",negative
poker game = surprisingly awesome climax.,positive
"Sorry, but Daniel Craig just isn't a James Bond. However, it's a good movie and more believable than previous 007 outings.",negative
I really need to own this movie. Loved it!,positive
Possibly the best bond yet,positive
"This was good. The torture scene made me cry. But overall, a great Bond flick, one of the best I've seen at least...Daniel was a good Bond.",positive
"Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery. But eventhougt Connery is a better Bond, this movie as a whole overtakes the other movies.The best Bond-movie to date.",positive
One of the best Bonds ever. Daniel Craig is just awesome.,positive
"bond is bigger and better than ever, can watch over and over",positive
"One of the best Bond's i've seen in a long while. I'm still not sure about a blonde as Bond, but Craig sure does fulfill the rest of the Bond criteria. Much better without all the gadgets, loved the M banter. As for the beginning..awesome! Looking forward to the next one..",positive
[See my comments on J. Bond],negative
"It was better than I thought it would be. If I am right Daniel Craig will be James Bond for a while. It was more serious than some previous Bond movies, which made it feel more realistic.",negative
"Call it BOND BEGINS. Easily the best Bond movie in years (and I was a fan of Timothy Dalton). It injects the stale series with life, vigor and a healthy dose of what at least feels and looks like reality. Daniel Craig is amazing.",positive
"best bond EVER hes hot, cool, sophisticated, edgy...mmmmm mmmmm brillant action etc..",positive
"Sort of like an American-Indian casino, but french...like that quote in Pulp Fiction.",positive
The Best Bond film of them all and no gadgets!,negative
a raw and gritty bond.,positive
Surely the best Bond of recent years. The excellent thing about this Bond film is that it stands up in it's own right. You don't need to know anything about Bond - it's just a damn good action movie with an actor (rather than a movie star) cast as Bond.,positive
"In the nineties and noughties, Bond films had such a lack of imagination you wondered if the series could ever be rescued. Thank goodness then for this welcome rejuvenation. Bond, played extremely well by Daniel Craig, is now fallible - no longer do we witness him take out the entire KGB and emerge with barely a scratch on him. This time he bruises, bleeds, suffers and shows human traits that have been badly lacking in previous efforts. Another triumph is the action segments, certainly some of the best I've ever seen in a Bond movie, zipping by at breakneck pace and thrilling in their unpredictability. The film isn't perfect - it's a fraction too long and the plot is mystifying at points, but somehow the sheer pulpy energy of the rest of the movie makes up for its shortcomings. Bond is back!",positive
"leffa on tÃ¤ydellinen, uusin Bond on tÃ¤ydellinen!",positive
Couldn't imagine a blonde 007 but Craig has lifted the character to a whole new level. The chase scene was just beautiful and full of surprises.,positive
"i like the new series with new actor, the money they spent on the movie are worth it. well done eva and daniel",positive
"This one was a pretty snazy flick, the ending really caught me off guard. It wasn't as action packed as some people had said it was, but overall was pretty damn good.",positive
The best Bond since 1908.,positive
I wish I was Eva Green! Best Bond and Bond Girl!!,positive
daniel craig has done an excellent job...,positive
One of the best Bond films ever! (-8 Amazing how they keep this series of movies going! These films started over 40 years ago.,positive
I learned poker watching this...heheheh YAY JAMES BOND!,positive
best bond in a very long time,negative
"James Bond is back! and I hope this one sticks around longer. Peirce sucked except for Goldeneye. Said in a Sean Connery voice on SNL: ""ya know Peirce, there's only one James Bond.""",positive
The best James Bond movie in a long long time.,positive
It was ok. Daniel Craig was ok. The action was ok. But where's the sense of humour and fun from the Connery days?,negative
A lot of people were skeptical about casting Daniel Craig as the new Bond. But we should all know by now that the producers have never chosen the wrong Bond. This isn't just a great Bond film but one of the best films of the 21st century as well. Eva Green was also perfect in the role of Vesper.,positive
"This film easily has the coolest title sequence I've seen all year. Music video director Daniel Kleinman worked with Framestore CFC (Europe's largest effects house) to create this jaw dropping sequence. It's too bad they have to follow the curse of the shitty opening song. Mr. Kleinman is set to direct the opening sequence for the next Bond film (Bond 22) as well. This film opens with a fantastic film noir style scene in which Bond makes his second kill to give him double 0 status. I was like an A.D.D. ridden little girl squirming in my seat in excitement during this scene and after the credit sequence I was convinced that no matter what happened after this just those two scenes were worth my time. The film continues into semi normal bond fare, although we do have crazy stunt laden scene directly after the titles. Then we get into the main plot of a crime lord bad guy who is financially in above his head and is relying on a high stakes poker game to keep up his evil bullshit. Obviously you send in the No0b Bond to beat this dude. The new James Bond is Daniel Craig. I really can't stress how much I love his face. It always looks gnarled. It looks super awesome when it's filled with cuts and bruises, which is often. He makes a wonderful Bond. Kudos to director Martin Campbell for making that choice. He was the director of Golden Eye which we may all recall as the last decent Bond film. Overall this was a fantastic film.",positive
Bätte än alla Brosnan Bond,positive
"first ""bond"" movie that i actually liked",positive
Classic Bond. The action is fantastic and Daniel Craig was much better than I thought he would be. I even know Non-Bond fans who loved it!,positive
2 words: Daniel Craig,positive
Daniel Craig is fine. That's all I have to say. And I really need all of Eva's dresses. You can see how DEEP my appreciation went... but no matter. I still had fun.,negative
"Good, Daniel Craig doesn't seem like Bond though...",negative
I think this captures the closest and most real Bond yet.,positive
After seeing Daniel Craig as Bond I'm convinced Pierce Brosnan pees sitting down. The noticeable lack of super-gadgets makes prior Bond movies look super-dorky.,positive
"I love Sean, but Daniel Craig IS James Bond. It was a brilliant decision to go back to the first Ian Fleming book and what the Bond character develop and smooth out his rough edges. l can't wait for the next Bond movie.",positive
"Not as powerful as many of the other Bond movies, but it's great because it really explains why he is Bond and how he became the man he is known to be",positive
"Amazing Bond film! Daniel Craig's wonderful, the story's interesting, and the action's intense.",positive
better james bond there could not be. Enjoyed fact there was no over the top stunts with hi-tech gizmos.,positive
"I don't like Bond movies, this one didn't change my mind. It was unnecessarily long winded... I must be the only woman on the planet to not find Daniel Craig sexy... UGGGGHHHHHH.",negative
"sorry, the chair scene ruined an other wise decent bond movie",negative
stop making bond movies,negative
The only James Bond I like,positive
Good movie. Daniel Craig did a nice job acting.,positive
"to little action, too much product placement and Daniel Craig has only one and a half facial expression.",negative
Didn't think Daniel Craig could pull this off but he did excellantly. One of the best Bond Films with a much harder edge than the others.,positive
"In fairness I never like Bond movies, so the fact that I'm rating this at all is a form of praise. Bond videogames however...",negative
"One of the best Bond movies - and yes, you purists, it does totally rival the Sean C. days. Dig the Parkour, Art du Deplacement scene in the beginning where Daniel chases the baddie in the beginning. One of the best opening credits too... must on a big screen.",positive
Bond.... Darth Bond.,positive
"Not a bad addition to the 007 library - not as gaudy as the rest, but still gets the job done - Derek Likey",negative
not the best bond movie,negative
Daniel Craig makes James Bond cool again.,positive
"The only Bond movie I've ever seen--it wasn't bad, but not the best action movie ever.",negative
I'm a huge Bond fan and this certainly didn't disappoint. Daniel Craig was definitely the right choice for the James Bond role.,positive
Doesn't feel like any other Bond film which is a good thing if you ask me!!!,positive
"didnt think i would like it, but i did!",positive
This is the best Bond movie since the Sean Connery era. I almost lost hope in the franchise with the lame Pearce Brosnan version.,positive
"lOVE THE NEW 007,but kinda miss the old cool Bond",positive
was good. But kinda violent and sad,negative
Definetly one of the best bond movies! Daniel plays the part of 007 very well and the story line is excellent.,positive
"Not quite the perfect Bond film, but definitely the closest yet.",positive
"It was a really good mindless action movie. However, Daniel Craig is NOT James Bond.",negative
"Tries to be Bourne, but too many slow bits.",negative
"craig has done bond proud, best bond movie i've seen in a long time",positive
"Craig does a good job. Its fast, its original and it will keep you hooked and on the edge of your seat!",positive
"Always Hated JB movies but this one, I LOVED! and Daniel Craig.... phaoowwwww",positive
Aivan sairaan hyvÃ¤nnÃ¤kÃ¶inen ukko! Muusta viis.,positive
This is one of the greatest Bond films (although Goldeneye is still my favorite)... really big budgets help movies like this travel all over the world and destroy Aston Martins... Craig is awesome and I can't wait for more.,positive
Much better then the recent Bond films,positive
Fantasic film..Daniel Craig has mastered the role of James Bond. This is the Bond that Fleming intended..not the comic japers of Roger Moore!!!,positive
By far my favorite Bond film. People were hating on Daniel Craig because he is a blonde Bond but he is everything you want and more as 007. I will also say that I was not a fan of Eva Green before this film but thought she was a hottie after seeing her. Can't wait till the next one.,positive
Bond back to his best,positive
"This flim was ruinned by following things, 1.bond did act the save. 2.NO GIRLS!!! 3.NEW NICE CAR is a serioulsy shit way.",negative
the best 007 movie i've seen,positive
It is defintiely the beginning of a new series of Bond films. Craig does a great job introducing himself as the new bond and I am sure that the rest of his 007 films will be good as well.,positive
PIERCE BROSNAN A SU LADO DA ASCO. SEAN CONNERY ES PRINCIPIANTE A SU LADO. PERO QUÉ BIENNNNNN¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ QUE SE JODAN TODOS LOS QUE CRITICARON A UN JAMES BOND RUBIO. HIJOS DE PUTAAAAAAAAAAAA,positive
"A vodka martini, please. Shaken or stirred? Do I look like I give a damn?",positive
"What can I say that hasn't been oversaid? Craig is the best choice they could have made to replace the name of Bond, by leaps and bounds. Looking forward to the next one.",positive
definately the best bond movie...n craig did a realli good job...very realistic...comapred to other bond movies...,positive
"Paras Bond. Ei mennytkään kun 20 vuotta, että ymmärsivät muuttaa Bondin suuntaa siitä kepeästä martinin litkimisestä miehekkääseen turpiin vetoon.",positive
"The best Bond film ever. hands down. Only a few early one by Connery come close. The harsh realism and plausibility of this movie far surpasses the average Bond flick and I think that if this pattern continues, it's for the best.",positive
Daniel Craig plays a pretty good Bond in this one!,positive
"all hail bond! too bad the gadget tradition is gone and the plot has an unhealthy dependence on cell phones, but bond is back!",negative
"The best Bond film since Connery packed it in. At long last someone's made Bond the cold and calculated killer Flemming created. Gone are the BBCesque effects and the cornball ""smooth"" oneliners. Instead you're given a secret agent to rival Jack Bauer and a pace, style and maturity that Bond has been lacking for decades.",positive
"Absolutely brilliant. Takes Bond back to it's roots and throws out the over-powering stench of cheese. By the time you are 10 minutes in you will know that you're watching a brutal, gritty Bond that we've never seen before. Certainly not one for Roger Moore fans, but for anyone who likes a good thriller, action/adventure or Sean Connery's Bond, I could not recommend it higher. This is what the big screen was made for.",positive
best bond movie i've seen....the new james bond is alot better,positive
Daniel Craig - what more do I have 2 say...??,positive
"Cool, but Bond's not supposed to fall in love.",negative
"a bond film that i can get behind. real, engaging, tragic, brutal; i was pretty blown away by the fact that it was an honest to goodness film and didn't just rest on the laurels of the bond name. i also really, really appreciate that the action also felt more organic and physical. the parkour chase in the beginning made me happy as a clam that likes a well executed action sequence.",positive
I didn't think I would like this one. I love his second kill.,positive
The first action scene is one of my favourites.,negative
The best bond film yet.,positive
I didnt like this movie nearly as much as everyone else,negative
"My favourite Bond movie, Bond is no longer invincible. It's flipping awesome and Craig kicks ass as Bond.",positive
First Bond movie in years that didn't roll my eyes. Excellent action and good sense of humour about the series/genre.,positive
"I've only really got one word for this movie. Bad Ass. It is nothing like it's predecessors. It really closely follows the intense spy storyline told by the books and less of the silly goofy bondness. Watch it whether you like Bond Movies, or not.",positive
I am already a Huge Bond fan... but this..... this is the next level! Loved it!,positive
One of the best Bond films ever. Daniel Craig ROCKS.,positive
best bond movie in years.,positive
my husband looks a lot like this hot new James Bond - i'm a lucky gal!!,positive
"daniel craig was a good james bond, surprisingly.",positive
"i heart bond, james bond",positive
Do you ever feel like a spy/secret agent when you leave the theatre after one of these? Or is it just me?,positive
"Thank God Brosnan's gone, ""James Bond"" should not be synonymous with ""douchebag"".",positive
"I'm still a Connery fan but this film as well as Goldeneye are probably the best in the series, Daniel Craig beats the crap out of the role and makes it his.",positive
Whoo... what a rush!!!,positive
But I still prefere Pierce Brsonan as James,negative
"Best Bond film ever. Also, I didn't think I'd like Daniel Craig as Bond, but he does a great job.",negative
"Daniel Craig looks realllly good in this...lol It has great action/adventure stuff in it, too...",positive
Awesome! Eva Green is hot and Bond is a badass.,positive
Worst bond movie ever. Bond was way out of character. Where was the great music and where were the gadgets!,negative
"Awesome. Sort of overly long, but man... Loved it.",positive
In my opinion....the best James Bond movie! I was sceptical at first but Daniel Craig prooved that he was more than capable to hold the name of Bond....James Bond.,positive
"I'm only an average to rather lukewarm fan of Bond movies... sitting next to my father, I managed to watch most of the older ones while growing up. When the newer ones with Pierce Brosnan came out, I saw all of them only because whichever group of friends voted to go. Hence, when this one came out, 2 of my friends randomly decided to see it wayyyy after the release date bc there was nothing else that our other friends had recommended. When the opening graphics started to play across the screen, I sat up a little straighter to take it all in. It showed the typical outline of guns shooting bullets but with extra sharp, clever graphics. And then the first chase/action scene was one of the best... ever. Even if all the jumping was crazy, I loved the rugged recklessness so uncharacteristic of the usual sharp-shooting Bond. And what's more, Craig and Green had amazing dynamic; I loved their prickly introduction-impression on the train, which then segued to the head-over-heels in a quick but sufficiently believable way. I also liked that the main female character had more depth to her than just a swimsuit-clad body.",positive
I'm not a Bond fan - but this movie blew me away. It's still got some of the tongue-in-cheek humour that forms 007's action sequences - but it's not camp like it's predecessors,positive
Daniel Craig makes THE most excellent Bond since Sean Connery.,positive
"intriguing, but not my favorite Bond",negative
Daniel Craig is pretty hot.,positive
"Vesper Lynd: It doesn't bother you? Killing all those people? James Bond: Well I wouldn't be very good at my job if it did. One of the most anticipated or may I just say the most anticipated film of 2006 period, was the new Bond film 'Casino Royale', a remake of the first of the Ian Fleming 007 novels that promised to re-invent the series. Being the skeptic I am, I initially thought 'Casino Royale' was going to turn out to be another Superman Returns, a film so many people had such high hopes for, but ended up letting them down tremendously. After hearing such positive reviews of 'Casino Royale' and discovering it's remarkable 94% positive reviews on rottentomatoes.com, I became very excited to see the film and find out if it was as good as it's word of mouth. To my surprise, 'Casino Royale' didn't disappoint me at all, in fact it surpassed my already high expectations. Although it's not an excellent piece of film-making, 'Casino Royale' succeeds with flying colors in bringing life to a tired, clichéd and worn-out action series again. From it's opening brutal black and white sequence in which our protagonist, Bond, James Bond, played expertly by Brit Daniel Craig, kills two people in order to achieve his double 0 status, we know there's something different about this Bond film. Instead of the fun and over-the-top campiness of the previous films, this is actually some gritty and cool stuff. It only gets more different when the opening title sequence doesn't feature the steamy sexual shadows of naked women of the previous 20 films, but instead it features silhouettes of Bond himself (fully-clothed, I should make clear) gracefully shooting his firearm at nothing in particular while playing card suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades) fizzle in the background. Then, it hits us, we aren't watching the same Bond movies we've been made to sit through for the last forty years, when the film delves into the character of James Bond -- he's not the eloquent, prudish and clean Bond we've seen portrayed by Pierce Brosnan, Roger Moore or even Sean Connery -- he's a tough, built, ruthless guy who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty and talks with a mouth full of food in one particular scene. But most importantly, he isn't the flawless super being like in the previous Bond films -- he has his flaws and he makes his mistakes because the guy is only human. In other words, there is a new bond in town and he's one bad ass motherf**ker! The plot here doesn't steer that far away from Ian Fleming's heralded novel, or so I've heard. The only real significant difference, I guess, is the leap from the 1960s to the present, 2006. Most bond films surround a ridiculous evil mad man trying to destroy or take over the world, but in this the villain is simple and relevant for the times we live in -- some obnoxious French asshole who is helping fund terrorists. For his first mission, Bond is assigned by his boss M (Dame Judi Dench) to stop the bastard by beating him in a casino poker tournament. From there, I won't tell you anything more, just that the film features great action sequences but is not overflowing with them. For the most part it's leisurely paced compared to the other Bond films, which is not a insult in the slightest bit. The film sometimes drag a bit, but I'd rather have that than constant non-stop action with no room for character or plot development. The screenplay is much superior to any of the Bond films and all other action films this year also. It has a few flaws, but for the most part it flows smooth and creates an ultra-cool atmosphere. Martin Campbell's direction is merit-able, as is the film's beautiful cinematography. The acting is also something to take note of as well. Every James Bond film before this was lacking in the acting department, but not 'Casino Royale'. Daniel Craig lunges onto the screen with his vibrant, engrossing and completely unique portrayal of James Bond, a very intelligent but in turn a very arrogant M16 field agent. Although he may not be deserving an Oscar nomination, what Craig does here is brilliant and courageous, he takes a beloved and cherished cinematic hero and does a complete 180 on his personality. This could have horribly back-fired on Craig, but instead it worked miraculously. Eva Green also is great as what I might consider the best 'Bond Babe' of all time. She's not a ditzy floozy or self-absorbed bitch, but a smart and cute little firecracker with her share of problems. She's more than one-dimensional, not to mention extraordinarily attractive (especially when she's out of makeup), which is a must for a 'Bond Babe'. The rest of the cast is solid but not as noticeable. The villains are all good enough and Mads Mikkelsen is convincing enough as the cowardly French villain, Le Chiffre. Judi Dench, Giancarlo Gianni and Angels in America's Jeffrey Wright are all excellent as always but it's unfortunate they have such small and meaningless roles. All in all, 'Casino Royale' is well worth your time if your time if you like action/thrillers and absolutely essential if you like Bond films. Great acting, solid directing, incredible action sequences, a gut-wrenching torture scene that will have guys in cold sweat and an intense poker showdown that will make you sweat bullets and that crazy French villain cry tears of blood (yuck, that was pretty disgusting!) make this one of the best remakes in recent years. This ain't your daddy's generational Bond movie, it's a powerhouse revival for the year 2006 that kicks the old films square in the balls. Grade: B+ (screened at The Cine Capri @ Harkins Scottsdale 101, Scottsdale, Arizona, 11/18/06)",positive
"Director Martin Campbell helmed the previous reinvention of the Bond franchise - the superb Goldeneye - and this is just as strong. This is Bond back to basics; a tough, rugged, morally ambiguous womaniser who couldn't give a damn whether his Martini is shaken or stirred. There are no clever gadgets (bar a car-mounted defibrillator), the chases are on foot for the most part (and all the more thrilling for it) and, although the film is long it never outstays its welcome. There is a negative that meant I had to dock it a point though - some of the worst exposition I've ever seen when Giancarlo Giannini's Mathis explains the status of the poker game to Vesper Lynd in brain-achingly basic detail. Such quips as ""There is now 50 million on the table"" or ""That is Le Chiffre's Tell, which means he's bluffing"" should have been omitted as they stand out like a sore thumb in an otherwise intelligent Bond script. Here's looking forward to Bond 22!",positive
"Ahhh at last i seen the film,tututut me could have seen it yonks ago anyways,Daniel Craig as the new Bond,am i impressed as a major Bond fan,hellz yeah,he has the charm n the charisma to play James,ooo i liked the free runnin scenes at the start,the lovey dovey scenes were a bit blah but oh well,good movie and cool cast!!!!",negative
"Really good. Much grittier than all the previous tosh. Daniel Craig's a bit wooden at times but there's still scope for a few cheesy lines and some erm, eye-watering violence. If you're a man, anyway!",positive
Ive hated all the other James Bonds because it never had much of a plot this one put all the others to shame.,positive
one of the best bond movies ever made,positive
Top stuff if you can get it on blu-ray!,positive
"The producers totally re-engineered James Bond. Man, were they courages - and successful, phantastic! Craig is fantastic. Adds a subtle brutality to the character while he maintains the softness in respect to women. I.e. certain women in certain situations..",positive
"Just incredible! Daniel Craig is the second best Bond, behind Sean Connery. The film itself was amazing. The scenes in Italy towards the end were superb. The collapsing buidling in Venice was very clever. Stunning",positive
I enjoyed this movie. Even if it was pre-007.,positive
"Perhaps not quite the best Bond film, but definitely the closest the movies have come to portraying the literary Bond.",positive
daniel craig delivers...,positive
"This is the best Bond movie so far with the most bad-ass, British looking Bond ever.",positive
"Definitely not the best in the series... Though definitely up there. He'll never beat Roger More or Sean Connery. Though with this movie, he easily beat George Lazenby and Timothy Dalton. Thought it was going to end a couple of times, was about to stand up, and then realized there was more, but aside from that it was very good. Not only that, but it's unfortunate about the real lack in the gadgets--those are what made all the other movies. Maybe his next movie will include them.",positive
I have seen all the Bond's movies....this is not a disappointment. I actually like his non-emotional face.,negative
"Get some Daniel Craig, Get some",positive
"Hmm, jag fÃ¶redrar nog Ã¤ndÃ¥ ""gamla"" James Bond filmer men det var ett snyggt fÃ¶rsÃ¶k att uppdatera genren",positive
"Thoroughly enjoyable so much that I pushed someone who walked infront of the tv to get out of the way. Suave, semi-sophisticated, and a dirty Bond. I thought the lack of selling sex was a big plus.",positive
"Casino Royale was fucking terrible. Is everyone in the fucking world on drugs? How come piece of shit fucking films like Clerks 2, V For Vendetta, Babel, Napoleon Dynamite et fucking al people love like the jesus when they are all flaming piece of shit fucking films? Thankfully Casino Royale is worse than all of these movies put together. All of you people who have just hollowly echoed the reviewers you've heard on tv (""Duh. I think he's the best bond ever."" ""Duh. This is the best bond movie yet duh."" The same fucking hollow regurgitations were circulating when the last shitty harry potter movie came out, the exact same fucking things when it was the worst film of the series, not that I'm saying Casino Royale is the worst film in the series, but it is pretty fucking terrible) have no idea what makes a movie good, and your a mindless fucking sheep. Daniel Craig has all the personality of wood, no more boring than wood, what's more boring than wood? Like, more boring than watching a fishing show where the fishermen are watching grass grow. More boring than watching the world series of poker, WHICH IS ABOUT WHAT LIKE FORTY FIVE FUCKING MINUTES OF THE MOVIE IS! JUST FUCKING DIFFERENT BORING SHOTS OF UNMOTIVATED BORED SHITTY ACTORS (sorry jeffrey wright what teh fuck were you doing in this piece of shit, do you really have that many bills that still need to get paid?) SITTING AROUND A FUCKING TABLE STARING AT EACH OTHER! This movie it goes on for nearly two and a half hours. The fucking ""big poker game"" or whatever the fuck, they break, like every ten minutes for potty and snacks, like a group of fucking senior citizens playing bingo. And another thing. Check out the sweet progressive role black people play in the movie. Deranged jungle guerillas and backstabbing double crossing cia agents. And another thing. La Cheefe or whatever the fuck his name is. Is the most over the top ridiculous bond villain spoof character this side of fucking Dr. Evil. I know your evil spooky bond villain has to have a weird physical defect or curiosity but three defects? Not only does he have different colored eyes, he also has asthma and he cries blood. The jerkoff who wrote the script probably jerked off all over the place with every fucking page he wrote. See the thing is, you've gotta make a choice when your making a movie, you have to either decide that your going to make a movie that is an obvious, direct homage to the classic 1960s bond spy movies or you have to make your modern crazed high tech spy movie, you can squish them both together, it's a fucking retarded mess. The movie does hit a lot of those old bond movie cliches, like two characters talking for like fifteen minutes about what's going on. The only difference is in the old movies the camera pretty much stayed in one or maybe two positions or moved slowly around a room. Now there is like 3847 cuts for a conversation between two people where they basically just keep repeating what's going on because the plot is convulted and inane and hackneyed ridiculous. Your supposed to be a super spy, right James? How super spy is it to, while playing your undercover character to constantly walk around in public talking to your contacts and talking out loud everywhere you go about all the spy things your going to do? Oh and when Judi Dench first pops on the screen I almost shrieked in fright because she was the first one in the movie to have any kind of energy what-so-ever. She just comes running on to the screen like ""Oh that James"" bringing back the best 1980s cop movie cliches around ""Bond you've really done it this time."" Also it takes this completely charmless Bond like ten minutes to say anything, he has to have these constant long speeches about fucking everything to why he chose that sandwich to when he plans to nap. Oh and I know that you take a certain leap of faith when watching movies such as this, but after a dozen or so WACKS TO THE BARE BALLS WITH A BIG FUCKING ROCK THING ON A ROPE YOU CAN'T FUCKING WALK, ALL YOU CAN DO IS PUKE AND CRY AND FALL APART AND NOT WALK OR MOVE AT ALL. See, that's why even though you think your like re-inventing the fucking wheel with your ""I got a great new torture thing to pull on Bond"" dealey scriptwriter cockface is the hottest jam in town, it fucking stinks to high heaven, it's fucking ludicrous. Why not, I dont know, have the guy stab him in the chest with an ice pick over and over, until he breaks free and runs away? Sure James can take a fucking beating, but the human body has it's fucking limits, he is not Batman and even fucking Batman's testicles would FUCKING TURN TO MUSH LIKE IN GONE LIKE IN APPLESAUCE LIKE IN POOLS OF BLOOD BETWEEN HIS THIGHS after that many slams to the balls. Connery never would've stood for that shit. And another thing. Most of the movie was just an excuse to get Craig to stand in the corner of the screen in either a dapper sharp looking tux or equally luxurious leisure wear and look away from whoever is talking to him. And another thing. The movie was probably scouted by the fucking producers of Wild on. And another thing. There is nothing to like about this bond. At all. You don't want to cheer for him because you have no reason to, he is just this fucking asshole who is like ""I know everything I am the best"" the whole time. We fucking hate assholes like that in real life. Dudes who have everything go their way and haven't really earned it and don't even make up for it with a personality. You want a fucking better plot I can shit out in two minutes? So this is a prequel right, and I know it follows the book or whatever the fuck, than the book has got to be just as boring if it's just PEOPLE PLAYING CARDS, (at least Rounders had Malkovich...Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich) but check it, you make young versions of all the bond villains, they have some sort of super evil club they belong to, that James smashes up, by playing them against each other Fistful of Dollars style and by excellent psychedelic evil base smashing action. Oh but then you dont get the chance to sell a bunch of laptops and cars, darn, thanks sony, your the best. Don't see this movie. It's fucking terrible, I cant stress that enough.",negative
I LOVE THIS BONDMOVIE! :D,positive
very exciting action,positive
"Best Bond made yet - Daniel Craig makes it. Bring on the next one, the next sexy Aston Martin and the next installment of Daniel half naked...",positive
"The greatest of the series...rebooted, refreshed, rugged, and ready for the 21st century. The Cold War is over, bitch...by taking him back to basics, we get an entirely new Bond - a man rather than a machine. I look forward to next year's sequel.",positive
"Not bad. Didn't feel like a Bond Movie but then again, he was still in the making.",negative
"Good. I'd heard there was an inordinate amount of product placement in this, as you tended to get in the Brosnan movies, but it wasn't bad at all. The action set pieces were really good, especially the early scene featuring the free running. Daniel Craig carries off the role well.",positive
"Bond was a bad-ass in this movie...this was before he was the lucky superspy we know now...he was more of a Jason Bourne than Bond actually...the whole him falling in love thing was weak, but I'm glad they got off that quickly and ended the movie with a bang.",positive
"loved it, love it. Anything with DC in it ....",positive
Dont like him!!! :p,negative
"One of the best 5 james bond movies ever, great bond",positive
this already is my favourite bond movie! shows how 007 became what you see in the original movies. Excellent action sequences. Daniel Craig seems just natural as Bond.,positive
"A nice return of Bond, jacking the series back to it's rightful place. Exciting, intriguing and less about sex more about secret agent fun!! I would say Craig is the best bond since Moore.",positive
the best bond film ever the acting was amazing,positive
great movie and greater book.,negative
Very good movie one of the beter James Bonds,positive
I LOVE BOND FILMS!!!,positive
"Some people have said that this is the best Bond film yet, and that Daniel Craig is the best thing since sliced bread. Sure, this movie was good, but it lacked a lot of ""Bondisms"". Very few action sequences, no Q gadgets, and some scenes were very long and drawn out. Don't get me wrong, this movie was good, but it wasn't Sean Connery good",negative
"The names Bond, James Bond. Brilliant and ingenious. Shaken not stirred. Can't wait for Quantum of Solace",positive
An amazing retooling of the franchise.,positive
A good prequel that's a bit darker than the typical bond flic. Pretty much explains why he's with 10 women per movie.,positive
I applaud the makers for a well done reboot of the Bond franchise. Not amazing... but look at the last several Bond movies and you'll see this is clearly a step up.,negative
not as good as pierce brosnan or sean connery.,negative
"Craig is fantastic as Bond. I saw this film in the US, and I walked out with a smile on my face thinking that, aside from the glits and glamour of Hollywood, this was filmed in humble Pinewood. Packed with action that keeps the audience entertained, the plot is as unpredictable and exciting as any 007 film. The tradition of very long Bond movies has continued, but it seemed worthy of the audience's time and money.",positive
"the only bond film i like, mmm daniel craig!",positive
james bond is the shit,positive
pretty sweet movie.The first scene is awsome. (the chase scene.),negative
the names bond james bond,negative
"Sigh...another James Bond movie that doesn't deliver. The action sequences were great but the plot had no substance, and any poker fan would dismiss the poker scenes as another movie that just didn't get it right...they should have stuck to baccarat. No character development and what a silly scene in the shower where Bond ""sucks the blood off her hands"". GIVE ME A BREAK!",negative
"Sorry, but Craig sucks as Bond. Film lacks punch or charm and is trying to hard to be Bourne. Testicle bashing amusing.",negative
"Daniel Craig...what can I say? The best bond I've seen. Loved him and loved the action scenes, amazing.",positive
Definitely the best bond since Sean Connery,positive
"This is only of the best Bond films yet. I was sceptical, but have to say that Daniel Craig makes a great Bond.",positive
"Best Bond movie in recent years. All of the acting is really good and it has some damn fine action in it, too. Better than the last two Brosnan Bonds, thats for sure.",negative
"This humanized, dark, (even more) cynical version of Bond is a huge success: Craig makes it seem he CAN be killed. He is more man than myth.",positive
watched the beginning was just bored so i stopped,negative
"best Bond for a while now, not bad for an ugly fucker",positive
I STILL think Daniel Craig (Bond) was screwed over when he was denied an Oscar Nomination for this film...,positive
Cool as fuck. Daniel Craig IS Bond. He is the ice cool killer we all deserved and only really got a bit of with Connery. This is one of those rare movies which allows me and my wife to agree on just how good it is. The final star is lost because I know too much about the character already and I wish that this had been my first taste of Bond.,positive
"I HATE James Bond films, but this is fantastic.",positive
the best james bond yet,positive
Best Bond since Sean Connery... Maybe the best ever in my opinion.,positive
"Guns, women and cars. Thats it really. Good if you're sad and straight.",negative
Of course there's only one Bond - but Daniel Craig comes in a close second.,positive
Oh my! This film is amazing for one scene and one scene only! Daniel Craig - Speedos! But apart from that it really is a wicked film!,positive
Dug it. Really like the new Bond.,positive
Daniel Craig is amazing as Bond,positive
"pretty good, pretty good",positive
si c'est ca le nouveau JB est-ce qu'on peut revenir en arriere SVP?,negative
best Jame Bond ever.,positive
Not my favourite Bond as not your a typical Bond. No gadgets - Nice action scenes though.,negative
"It's probably not that difficult to be the best Bond film in thirty years and in truth it's not that big a stretch to be one of the best Bond films ever either. Casino Royale lives up to both those tags and it is a more than competetent Bond film, delivering some tremendous action sequences in the first half of the film before allowing time for Bond, as a character to develop. The second half of the film fleshes out Bond, presenting a different character to what you're used to, giving you some background into his pysche, then the film goes a bit skew-whiff by overcooking the romantic aspect to this cold-blooded killer who falls in love after his first shag. The laying on of the Forever Friends relationship held back everything else and instead of being a bigger and better Bourne Identity it all felt a bit contrived and manipulative. Daniel Craig was good and the attempt to bring a degree of realism to the scenes of violence is long overdue so in the context of being a Bond film it's a very good one, in the context of how it sits against other films, I thought it was enjoyable, entertaining and overall a good film.",negative
daniel craig pulled it off!!,negative
Paras Bond-näyttelijä,positive
Brilliant film.Im not too into the james bond films but this one was amazing.Well done to Mr Craig.,positive
Best from modern Bond movies,positive
Best Bond since Connery,positive
"An excellent restart that takes Bond back to the Ian Fleming-based cold assassin like the unbeatable Connery era. Brilliant production values and direction kept up the gloss and action of a Bond film, but greater depth and strong performances - notably from Craig, make it easily one of the best in the series.",positive
"One of my faves. I was a little skeptical of Daniel Craig at first, but he's now one of my favorite Bonds.",positive
"Horrible, horrible movie....nothing remotely close to the older bond films. No chases, no narrow escapes....zilch. New bond please!",negative
I'm a sucker for Bond movies. They remind me of Cary Grant in North By Northwest.,positive
Daniel Craig is hot.,positive
my favourite bond movie of them all.. Mainly cause it doesn't follow the corny bond formula. I enjoyed it,positive
"didn't follow the james bond model enough, and if you're making a james bond movie, thats kinof important.",negative
"Not my favorite Bond movie, but I do like Craig's acting ability",negative
James Bond grows up.,positive
"This film really revived the bond franchise. Daniel Craig played a great bond, and Mads was fantastic as the creepy villain!",positive
"The best bond movie ever. Daniel Craig is magnificent, action and special effects are gripping. Humanises Bond and is much closer to Ian Fleming's original Bond than most of the previous Bond movies. I never thought I'd say this but... move over Sean Connery, Daniel has stolen your crown!",positive
"No gadgets or jokes, excellent action and an ok-ish plot. No problems with Daniel Craig as Bond. A more grown-up film but still not Bourne.",positive
First Bond movie I've ever seen. Jason Bourne could beat James Bond up one handed but the movie was still pretty cool.,negative
This Bond is growing on me slowly.,positive
"This is a totally different taste of Bond. Very enjoyable, but just a little long.",positive
"Good overall, good debut for Craig. But it certainly miss something or someone Pierce Bronsman !!!",negative
"One of, if not THE best James Bond film of all time.",positive
Bond!!! JAMES BOND!!!,positive
best Bond movie ever! Casino Royale humanized 007 and explained his preference for solitude among other traits.,positive
horrible es poco. pesima.,negative
"En av de beste Bond-filmene jeg har sett. ""Back to the roots"" er vel en god beskrivelse.",positive
"OMG how cool is Bond??? to those who questionned Daniel Craig as Pierce Brosnans successor i hope you have al eaten ur words!! This is best Bond outing in a long long time, great action sequences, fantastic bond wit as always! the only downside is the rather nasty torture scene which will make any mans eyes water!! fantastic",positive
excellent for a bond movie,positive
"The best Bond Movie ever, the story is amazing. The action from the opening scene just keeps getting better and better.",positive
many people say they dont like daniel craig as the new bond but i think he does a great job. hes a lot different than the others and i jsut liek this movie a lot!,positive
"This really is a unique Bond movie, because it breaks the stereotypical suave gentleman role. This can especially be seen in the opening freerunning sequence. Simply because of this, the movie scores highly, not to mention the intelligent plot.",positive
"Still doesn't feel like a Bond movie. Not enough action, car chases or exotic locales.",negative
an okay james bond flick but not my favorite,negative
"It's too bad that Pierce Brosnan had to end his career like he did. However, Craig revives the series by playing perhaps the best Bond figure ever. Charming, mysterious, stealthy, agile, crazy...it's all there. Made by the same guys who made Goldeneye, which is the best movie ever.",positive
The best Bond since the Connery Bonds! Daniel gets my thumbs up!,positive
the best bond movie period...,positive
"Top movie, completly different to all the other movies in the franchise, however reasuringly familier at the sametime. Great stunts, great story line, fantastic to see how the charactor developes into the Bond we know and love!",positive
Great actor for a great movie.,positive
"Bond rebooted, and with some style! The free-running scene at the beginning is just ace. Bravo Daniel Craig!",positive
It's Bond. need I say more?,negative
"A good plot, some great action and some superb acting crossed with the odd good plot twist here and there - How can you go wrong?",positive
Yllätyin siitä kuinka hyvä tämä oli. ja siitä kuinka uskottava.,positive
i just love my husband in this hes so fit.love u always daniel,positive
"The beginning of a new era.....In my opinion Daniel Craig is the best bond out of the lot.... he's bought something different to the table in terms of action.He's made this character his own. Daniel Craig is the real bond, slick and stylish.",positive
almost as good as sean connery,positive
All time worst Bond movie. I am glad to only bought this after 2007 Christmas sale. So not much loss apart from time.,negative
"le meilleur bond qui ait Ã©tÃ© fait, Daniel Craig excellent et Eva green a Ã©tÃ© bien meilleure que je ne l'aurais pensÃ©",negative
Impressive debut for Daniel Craig. Sensible and intelligable plot with some great action and high tension moments.,negative
Bond is back in Daniel Craig. Finally a Bond movie again which is not over the top.,positive
"not bad, not a true bond flick also",positive
This has got to be the best Bond film to date.,positive
"I watched a good while ago and couldn't even make it through without sleeping... but with the help of caffeine and some friends, it turns out it's a pretty spectacular movie.",positive
Probably the best Bond film of all time.,positive
"It's weak in some areas. It tries to explain every aspect of Bond's awesome. We don't care why he is awesome, he just is.",negative
"Good bond flick, they're all great apart from the Timothy Dalton drivel flicks.",positive
Classic action packed entertainment. This is also the first Bond that has a truly British feel to it.,negative
Waiting for the next one...,positive
"wonderful stunts and the entry of another bond-nonetheless a better one , more energetic and a bit too sharp. The movie was at par if not better than the previous bond stints but yet it keeps you spell bound.Daniel craig and eva green though show signs of making a good pair.overall worth seeing once.",negative
"This was one of very few movies from 2006 that really grabbed me and this new re-vemped Bond was a joy to watch and I never get bourd of watching it. Although I am a Bond fan and loved Pierce Brosnan as 007, after seeing Daniel Craig, he made Brosnan look a bit wet and slimey.",positive
"Eva Green... waouh, it's a perfection! Eh James!!! I kick your ass in poker when U want!",positive
"The best Bond movie ever! Well, at least the first one I've ever liked. It's kind of, ""when is a Bond movie not a Bond movie?"" really. Stripped of all the gadgets and the campy humour and the school boys', approach to sex and action it's more of a superior spy thriller, and a Bond movie in name only. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean because he's raw and masculine and dangerous enough to do some damage. This movie not only shows us how Bond got his licence to kill, it presents him as someone to deserves to have the thing. The opening chase is dynamite. There are lots of twists and turns in the plot, it seems to run out of steam but then has a finish that BRINGS THE HOUSE DOWN. Whoa! What a zinger!",positive
Best bond film ever - with plenty humor too!,positive
I prefer Pierce Brosnan,negative
"Almost perfecto...very enjoyable 2,5 hours :)",positive
"This is Bond at its best, great action film let down by a slow ending. roll on the next 1",positive
"Along with being one of the best movies of 2006, it's one of the best Bond movies of all time. It's slick, stylish and wholly engaging, like any good Bond movie should be. Eva Green is a good actress, but isn't really up to par with the hotness of the other Bond girls, however. The opening chase scene deserved an Oscar on its own. An amazing movie.",positive
"Bond is back! (I better I am not the 1st person to say that?) Daniel Craig is one of the best Bonds, I don't care he is blond, because he is that good. Let's hope they can follow this up with another great Bond film?",positive
holy crap prob the best james bond movie yet,positive
BORING!!! but not terrible.,negative
"I didn't think it had any story, but he pulled off being Bond.",positive
i was surpised that i actual liked this newby bond,positive
His privates sure took a beating from that french man.,negative
best bond since Connery,positive
I hate James Bond...until this movie! This James Bond rocks!,positive
best of the new bonds.,positive
"I guess it was cool when he ran through that wall. District 13 is better in every way, and its budget was whatever luc besson found in his back pocket.",negative
Best Bond since Connery,positive
"I liked more things (Craig's look, opening credits, hand-to-hand choreography) about this than the rating suggests, but it was just so insufferably long overall and slow in parts that I have to downgrade the overall viewing experience. The only reason I watched is because Marc Forster is directing the sequel.",negative
one of the best Bond moveis ever!!,positive
Le meilleur James Bond selon moi!,positive
Best of the new Bonds so far,positive
My favorite Bond movie. Craig is a lot more gritty compared to previous Bonds and he does a very good job. The action was just right (not over the top) and eye candy was superb too.,positive
awesome! best Bond movie!,positive
A gd Bond film but still not my favourite one.,negative
great great great!! Daniel Craig makes an excellent bond and is as brooding as Fleming would have wanted him to be. Best Bond film in years....and the scenes coming out of the sea are clearly worth re-watching over and over again....... :-),positive
there was only one reason i originally wanted to see this film - daniel craig. Having seen all the bond movies over the years this one beats them all. from the opening scenes right through to the end the action doesnt stop & laced with cheeky humour this is definately one of my fave films,positive
best bond movie ever!!!,positive
"2 reason i would EVER watch this a. The beautiful eva green. b. The ONLY sction scene, of the Austin flipping over was Suuuperb!!! Reason not to like this Bond movie..... er a million i guess",negative
"A great Bond film, reinventing the genre a bit.",positive
got me hooked to poker....lool,positive
"[center][img]http://mpcdigital.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/casino-royale-salida-casino-poster-tn.JPG[/img] [/center] El día de su estreno, amigos y un servidor fuimos a ver [b]Bond Begins[/b]... estooo... [b]Bond: Año Uno[/b]... er... [b]Casino Royale[/b], coñe ya. Claro que si uno se pone a pensarlo no van desencaminados esos dos títulos para hacer referencia a esta película, número 21 de la saga canónica del [b]Bond[/b] cinematográfico. En otros filmes anteriores (concretamente en [b]Al Servicio Secreto de su Majestad[/b] y [b]Muere Otro Día[/b]) se insinuaba que el nombre [i]James Bond[/i] podría ser un código tanto como el número [i]007[/i], explicando así las distintas caras del personaje a lo largo del tiempo y películas (que eso no explicase las distintas caras de [b]M[/b], [b]Monneypenny[/b] y [b]Felix Leiter[/b] no parece venir a cuento a los partidarios de esa teoría). [b]Casino Royale[/b] parte de la premisa de que [b]Bond[/b] es [b]Bond[/b] y solo hay uno, y que en su momento fue un novato como cualquier otro, con su licencia de agente [i]00[/i] recién conseguida. Claro que el tono general de la película, la muestra de ese [b]Bond[/b] más cercano que nunca al de los escritos de [i]Ian Fleming[/i] y el aumento de un tono realista dejando de lado las excentrecidades más categóricas de la saga insinúan también que este bien podría ser el inicio de una nueva continuidad (si podemos usar ese termino en las películas de [b]Bond[/b]), lo cual se ve reforzado cuando uno lee por ahí que el próximo [b]Bond 22[/b] será una continuación directa de este [b]Casino Royale[/b]. En pocas palabras, nos encontramos ante una película bastante redonda, fresca, divertida, con momentos de acción de un nivel altísimo (esa persecución inicial, ese aeropuerto de [i]Miami[/i]...), suspense del bueno (acojona esa partida de poker), un [b]Bond[/b] más matón y asesino frío que nunca (como en las novelas, y no el chulopiscinas de muchas de las películas... un aplauso a [i]Daniel Craig[/i], que convence como pocos), una chica que no es un florero (una genial [b]Vesper Lynd[/b] interpretada por [i]Eva Green[/i], cuyos diálogos con [b]Bond[/b] son de lo mejor del film), un malo carismático y siniestro que no es el enésimo megalomaniaco que uno acostumbra a ver en estos films, etc... todo aderezado con una BSO de [i]David Arnold[/i] en la que, curiosamente, el tema musical de [b]Bond [/b]de toda la vida queda reservado para ese momento final del film en el que James se convierte en Bond. Mira tu por donde, por una vez la frase de la promoción televisiva, no anda desencaminada.",positive
"Got he is sooo hot - smouldering, why aren't there guys like him in Northampton?",positive
"A new Bond for a new era - and he's a good one, in his initial voyage. The last Fleming Bond novel to be ""adapted"", CASINO is welcomely retro: no silly gadgets or inane quips - just the psychological scarring of a novice killer-Double O. Love the way you never hear the ""Bond theme"" until the last two minutes. Not bad.",negative
Bond re-invented: gritty and brutal.,negative
The intermitent action was good and so was the cast. I was wrapped from the beginning,positive
One of the best Bond movies to date.,positive
greatest movie of all time.,positive
best bond movie ive seen and daniel craig was a well played bond. new tough and with a hint of suave.,positive
Boo-hiss on anyone who says Craig doesn't make for anything but a superb Bond.,positive
"Best bond movie I have seen. Draws 3-dimensional characters and brings some emotion and drama to the roles of both Bond, and the bond girl. Extra half point for Eva Green :)",positive
"I haven't seen all of the bond movies, but this just didn't quite feel like the others that I [i]have[/i] seen. I was expecting there to be more action and I was a little disappointed with the movie's plot. I did, however, like Daniel Craig as the new James Bond.",negative
the best bond movie ever.,positive
"Would you believe that after the shitstorm that was Die Another Day, they go out and make the best Bond movie of all time? It happened. After this and Goldeneye, it is apparent that Martin Campbell knows what the hell he's doing when it comes to Bond.",positive
"oh dear, was completely and utterly seduced by the incredibly sexy performance of Daniel Craig as OO7, bah humbug especially as he reminds me slightly of my ex, not that he needs to know, his ego is big enough. Thoroughly enjoyed the film too :oP",positive
"Daniel Craig is a great Bond - back to basics with a rough edge and a rougher tongue. Before him - Sean Connery was my favourite Bond ever, never rated the others (especially Moore). Looking forward to the new Bond movie in 2009 :-)",positive
good action and good movie!,positive
"The best Bond movie in decades. This movie is simultaneously gritty and suave. Craig's outstanding portrayal of Bond at the beginning of his 007 career is the best since Connery's take on the character. The writers have also portrayed Bond as a highly dedicated, intelligent and skilled operative with slight sociopathic tendencies, just the sort of person needed to deal with the increasingly complex vagaries of a post-9/11 world. Additionally, the musical score, plot, cinematography, action sequences, dialogue, interesting villains, beautiful yet non-objectified women, and a great sense of play all make this a must-see film.",positive
"I'm sorry but I didn't like this Bond movie. Nothing against Daniel Craigs performance, but there was very little action and plot. Way too much time playing cards in this movie. I was very confused at how the Bond girl died in this movie. She appeared to drown, woke up and then died. I was a little perplexed at that scene. Could have been better and I expected more, at least from the Pierce Brosnan series",negative
"Finally, a Bond you would believe could kill in cold blood. I felt Craig's Bond was much closer to the literary Bond. Engrossed from the opening scenes. Roll on Bond 22.",positive
Blue trunks. Nuff said.,positive
"My first Bond movie, and I enjoyed it. Eva Green is brilliant, as always, and I quite enjoyed Mr Craig, jumping about, shooting things, he was cool.",positive
A great refresh to the series that was starting to get a little stale. The first action scene was the best of the entire series.,positive
Is It The Best Bond Film? No But Its Still A Must See!,positive
AWESOME!!!!!!!....i dont like bond movies...but this one very very good movie,positive
"Action all the way, fast moving, entertaining if a little gruesome in parts. Great storyline and loved the ending.",positive
"It's not a Bond film! The feel is all wrong, the continuity is out of the window and it's got some pervy sadistic scenes. Die Another Day wasn't great, but it was the end of an era.",negative
"During the film you see Craig doing his rape stare all the time, and it's awesome........",positive
Didnt really like it. To be honest dont like any Bond movies,negative
best james bond ever,positive
"Daniel Craig pisse le sang, s'emporte, s'énerve quand il perd et surtout, il souffre. Chose que le mythe James Bond avait oublié dans sa splendeur trop immaculé. Le meilleur 007 amha.",positive
i'm on Daniel Craig's side. he's the best Bond ever.,negative
"I am told this movie doesn't do justice to the other ones because it messes with the characters and tries to give too much background. Without having seen any of the other Bond films, i can say i enjoyed this film because it was slick and Craig does a great Bond as far as i can imagine he should be.",positive
"esta buenÃ­sima, nada de babosadas explotando aquÃ­ y allÃ¡, es james bond como debe ser, directo y puro.",positive
"My first Bond film, and it makes me want to see more. Seriously impressed with Daniel Craig.",positive
"I got this for christmas, and it has inspired me to become James Bond. Huzzah!",positive
"Ehh, it was pretty good. Lots of action, but I was kind of sleepy when I watched it, so I guess I'll have to watch it again some time. Oh, and Daniel Craig runs funny.",negative
"Starting in Black and White it gives Bond, one of the coolest openings ever. Daniel Craig plays Bond at the beginning, who makes mistakes, is emotional and at times is rather brutal. The action is awesome with an amazing chase scene in a consturction site, that sure will deliver a ""wow."" Interesting story that if I had to nitpick the thing is the time length, one of the longest compared to other Bonds. And an ending...lets just say is different, unexpected for a Bond flick.",positive
The problem with James Bond films is that teh best action sequence is always at the beginning. I did enjoy this but the middle section love story should have been cut down.,negative
Brill and Daniel is gorgeous!,negative
"Meilleur des James bond Ã  mon avis! Je n'Ã©tais pas convaincue par Daniel Craig avant de voir le film, mais finalement, excellente performance! Tout Ã  fait savoureux!",positive
The best Bond movie to date maybe because its not so tongue in cheek.I think Ian Fleming would have enjoyed this.Sean is still the best character for Bond but This story is very good and much easier to follow.,positive
Never liked the James Bond movies. This one however sets up a much stronger strength of character and makes the difference,positive
"craig is better than any bond since connery, and eva green is one of the hottest bond girls ever",positive
"More action, less gadgets. That's it!",positive
"So dirty, but finally a good Bond movie.",positive
"Mah, 007 era una persona elegante, o sbaglio?",negative
"I was iffy at first, as I am a Pierce Brosan fan. But Daniel Craig certainly pulled off a good Bond. I always loved stories about the beginning of these type of heroes. The story line was pretty good and the action scenes great, as can be expected for the Bond series.",positive
"new Bond is far from perfect, but prefect for Bond",positive
It was a relief to see a bond film that wasn't laden with plastic gadgets & exploding gizmo's. The acting is good as I would expect from Daniel Craig. I hope this is the future of bond films now!!,positive
The only Bond movie worth watching.,negative
A very different Bond movie. Looks like they're considering reinventing the brand.,positive
great movie kept me goin,positive
"just watched the movie tonight again on sky. as good as i remember it. can't wait for the next movie, which may or not be called 007.",positive
This Bond kicks major ass! Safe to say that this is the macho version of the Bond Series. PQ and SQ: Excellent (blu-ray) Story: Great Acting: Very good I am ready for the next..,positive
phwoarrrh. daniel craig. enough said!,positive
the best bond Movie..Daniel Craig is Great as James Bond.,positive
"Lots of action and no gadgetry or silly conquer the world schemes in this Bond movie, which I am kind of split down the middle on. The cinematography is great and the story is pretty good, although, like the book, I thought the ending dragged a bit and the climax was too early. Still, quite good and the intro is one of my favorites.",negative
The best James Bond ever.,positive
"I've always loved Bond films, but this one is on an entirely different level. Craig plays a very different, more realistic Bond. In my opinion he's the best one so far. This has become one of my favorites.",positive
Stylish and modern. Does Bond good and with all the best can be watched on repeat without losing excitement.,positive
very good!!! i loved it!!!,positive
The best Bond... ever,positive
my names bond ................ JAMES BOND.............???????,positive
"I know it's not the same as the old 007, but I liked it",negative
One of the most exciting films ever! Daniel Craig makes a good Bond and Eva Green makes a good Bond girl. . . x,positive
"Very different direction for Bond, but very appropriate. I loved it!",positive
not full mark but good,positive
Best Bond movie ever. Can't wait for the next one.,positive
"sean connery is great, but this is the best composed and executed bond story of them all",positive
"Way better than average Bond flick. The makers of Bond seem to do right when they hire the unknowns. Daniel Craig brings the attitude of Dalton with the panache of Connery and the wits of Brosnan, flipping the series on its ear, and bringing a new Bond for a new generation after the overblown ""Die Another Day."" Bond is back and will return. Well worth the purchase.",positive
A lot lot better than I thought - mch darker but could see the twist at the end coming.,positive
Awesome movie i love Daniel Craig,positive
Un _James Bonb burdo y violento,negative
Daniel Craig is officially my favorite Bond since Sean Connery!!,positive
"All other Bond's (except Goldeneye) should be like this as they all suck. This is brilliant, believable spy shit",positive
a blond james bond?luv it anyhw,positive
"After all those years of second rate Brosnan Bond-movies, we are finally treated a decent Bond-movie - which is to greatly underestimate this masterpiece. I'll always be faithful to a couple of Bond flicks from before 90's, but I can't deny the possibility that Casino Royale might even be the best Bond movie. Of course, I also had low expectations.",positive
Opening scenes awesome!,positive
"Best James Bond movie I saw in my life, but then again I only saw a few.",negative
"The best Bond movie in years. No silly CGI's, no gimmicks or gizmos and a straight forward, realistic storyline. Hopefully this will be the start of a new string of gritty, realistic Bonds. Bond is dead, long live Bond!",positive
"I'm not a massive Bond fan for various reasons. This Bond film stands on it's own. Great acting and a dark Bond. If they continue like this, I'd be happy to watch the next one.",negative
good but a little sad,positive
Bond finally gets his balls back after 25 years.,positive
"Bond movies just don't do much for us. And ""blondebond"" - please give me a break, he's not blonde but mousy colour! Otherwise Daniel Craig fits well in the character. This James Bond has more depth than his previous counterparts, but is still very shallow. Dramaturgy is too predictable and because of that the movie is numbing.",negative
Great reboot of the franchise.,positive
My favorite 007 movie yet!,positive
Bond at his most bastard-est. Plus Judi Dench is hot!,positive
Gets better every time I watch it. Daniel Craig redefines Bond. Favorite scene - Bond getting his cool back washing off the blood after killing the baddies. He's still a human being - not an unstoppable killing machine. Awesome.,positive
by far the best bond yet,positive
"Tied with 'GoldenEye' as my favorite Bond film. Go figure, both of my favorite 007 movies are ""reboots"" directed by Martin Campbell...I wondering if that's saying something, KEEP HIM! Anyway, I loved Daniel Craig as Bond, never doubted him at all once he was announced as the new 007 (if you'd seen L4yer Cake you'd have known immediately he was the perfect choice). Anyway, the chase scenes were great, the characters were well written and I'm looking forward to see what the next Daniel Craig Bond film will be like. My only disappointment in the film is I wanted the Aston Martin car chase to be longer and bigger, it was only about 45 seconds.",positive
SPIN OUT THIS MOVIE REALLY ACTION PACKED AND FULL OF ADRENALIN MAKES ME WANN DO THE IMPOSSIBLE!!!,positive
Bad plot. Bad acting. Plausible action sequences...That's a bad James Bond! Bad James Bond! Outside for you! And no table scraps!,negative
not bad. Original one with Peter Sellers will crack you up.,negative
"Giving this movie four stars seems hardly fair. It's a bond movie and far from perfect but I went into it with such low expectations that the face they chose to turn it into a character study blew me away. To me this is the best Bond ever. (I've never jived with the portrayal of Bond's extreme ""masculinity"" as a good thing. His violence and womanizing are inhumane and the loss of humanity portrayed in this movie makes me love it.",positive
really good story and great acting,negative
"Started out with great momentum but dragged on way too long. They could have easily trimmed a lot of excess fat out of this film. The parkour chase sequence is easily the best part of the film. Still, it's great to see Bond in a gadget-light film again, as it should be. Extra points for the lack of cheesy CGI windsurfing sequences. Better than most Bond films (though that's not saying much), and overall a promising reboot for the franchise.",negative
it's more realistic than other Bond movies,positive
"Fuckin awesome opening chase scene, and i'm not usually a big fan of elaborate chase scenes... Craig got back to the core of the character.",positive
"wow, this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. Daniel Craig is amazing.",positive
Craig almost nails Bond in the franchise reboot.,positive
"Back to basics, and it's for the best after the OTT FX-laden Die Another Day. Ever since I saw Layer Cake I thought Craig wouldn't make a bad Bond, and he pulls it off just fine. Some brilliant one liners, and the final scene is perfect as we hear that familiar theme for the first time, along with that immortal line...",positive
"Awesome, started slow but its the origin of bond. the title song is kool. And this bond is as tough as nails",positive
the flogging scene was highly disturbing and im not even a guy.,positive
"Quite simply, what Bond should be.",positive
"I think it's probably the best 007 movies i've seen... I would have given it a higher rate but the torturing scene, speaking as a guy, was too disturbing for me to watch",negative
i liked this bond movie maore than any other,positive
BEST Bond movie in YEARS!!,positive
Stupid plot which doesn't seem to make any sense. But kick arse action set pieces. Daniel Craig was okay as bond but this should have been a lot better.,negative
it only took 30 years to make a good Bond movie.,positive
Certainement le meilleur Bond !,positive
"Good action movie, but not very Bond...",negative
best Bond movie in a long time,positive
"Bond's back, baby! Cooler, darker and tougher than ever. Best to Bond movie to date. The character seems stronger now that he's flawed.",positive
best bond movie best bond actor best bond song,positive
good action and it iz sik,positive
Toimiva kokonaisuus.,positive
One of the best Bond movie!!!,positive
"Daniel Craig is HOT! :-) For once, a Bond movie that isn't limited to being JUST a Bond movie.",positive
"i didnt want to watch it, but when i did, i was blown away by how appealing this film was even to me.",positive
A change from the normal Bond movie.,positive
at first i thought daniel craig was goin 2 be a crap bond but surprisingly he was a really gd bond,positive
Surprisingly I found this movie quite enjoyable. Packed with action.,positive
"At least the bond series is actually getting decent again, but just took to long towards the end.",negative
My favorite Bond movie with my second favorite Bond.,positive
transformed the bond genre for the better,positive
the best bond film ever,positive
"This is exactly what the James Bond franchise needed. I'm impressed by Daniel Craig he makes a very believable character, he's bad and tough, and he has the cool comments. No laserguns, invisible cars or super satellites, just raw action from begging to the end. The ending dragged out a little, but it makes me look forward to the next film, like a kid to christmas!!!",positive
Daniel Craig makes a great Bond,positive
TrÃ¨s bon James Bond,negative
"It was fairly enjoyable film but as it was a remake of the 1st one it didn't seem to work. Bond had just been given his 00 status, 9/11 had just happened and he was introduced to major characters such as Felix Lighter for the 1st time this just didn't ring true to the series and what had gone before. I think it would have worked better if it had been set in the same time frame as the original and acted as a guide to how James Bond was ""born"" and not bowed to the blatant product placement of the DB9 for the crash, I don't think the film would have suffered for it. It will be interesting to see How Daniel Craig grows into the role but he didn't do badly for his 1st attempt.",negative
Best Bond movie ever!! I think I saw it like 7 times!!!,positive
not a bond fan but this is a good film.surprised have good daniel craig is as bond.,positive
Loved The Chase At The Start x,positive
"Best 007 film in ages. Daniel Craig plays a Bond that is much closer to the Fleming original. Dark, brooding, violent, vengeful, almost psychopathic. Great stuff.",positive
"I've never liked bond movies, but this one is great... it's action all the time!",negative
"I think its like the 4th time now I've seen it and its still good. REALLY good. Can't wait for the next one, but they really have to do good to beat this one... (And Neil, Bond NEVER drove a Focus... ;)",positive
Absolutely brilliant... this is what bond should be like,positive
craig on loistava bond,positive
"All the crap that normally gets on my tits with the other Bond movies is gone with Casino Royale. What they deliver is a Bond minus the impossible gimmicks and excessive womanising. They give it more of a 'spy' feel, but still with the action, humor and 'Bond' vibe (and of course the Austin Martin!). I felt they really worked the plot line well and all the characters were well cast - especially Craig. An excellent 'back story' to JB's character and well worth a view.",positive
"Compared to the other Bonds this was a bit average, but then it is supposed to be his first mission so it's ""allowed"" to be as less tech as the others - I personally didn't like is.. Especially what happened to the signature car and no gadgets!! Very disappointed for a Bond movie but not as much as the other previous ones.",negative
best bond ever !! must watch dis,positive
"awesome action movie, not a bond film.",negative
"This is a new take on Bond and I think it's a good direction. None of the fun of Bond films is lost, but the darker edge makes him a better character.",negative
My new favorite Bond film.,positive
James Bond is back again. guys uv got to watch this movie...xxx,positive
In my opinion (but apparently I am alone on this) probably the worst James Bond movie I've seen.,negative
"Everything I hate (and I mean REALLY HATE) about Bond movies is gone in Casino Royale, one of the best action films I've ever seen. The film takes a page from the Bourne series, replacing a smug, womanizing asshole for a lead with a man who actually feels and makes mistakes. Modern audiences, I think, want more than sexual innuendo and gadgetry; they want an actual movie, one with a unique storyline and characters who don't simply fill predetermined archetypes like ""the bad guy"" or ""the Bond girl."" Casino Royale does that, all while providing phenomenal action and suspense sequences (the middle-act poker sequence is one for the ages). Here is a Bond movie that can make a jaded 22-year-old teary eyed.",positive
This is the rough and hardcore Bond as we have never seen him before.,positive
watched it on a plane but didnt pay much attention,negative
"The new Bond and a better one too, though not as 'happy'. The parcour scene is simply a masterpiece.",positive
Best and most realistic bond movie yet,positive
Best Bond movie. Period.,positive
"Mmmmmh Daniel Craig, swimming trunks, mmmmmmmmmmmmh....",positive
Daniel Craig does a good job at portraying the infamous James Bond. Good storyline and great action scenes. A great installment to the series!,positive
"Best Bond film in ages, possibly ever. Far more gritty and dramatic than the previous Brosnan efforts, where the franchise had almost become a parody of itself.",positive
"Probably the best James Bond that The Royal Service ever have, this 007 Rock !",positive
daniel draigh doesnt play bond so effectively as his predecessors.nyc movie all the same,negative
surprised by this movie,positive
"It's ok, nice to see a new spin on it. Daniel Craig didn't ruin the franchise like some people thought he would, but he didn't make it anything spectacular either. This still has all the bad jokes and inuendo, the only difference is that there's more sex and bigger explosions.",negative
I enjoyed watching this and i think he looked good coming out of the ocean hehe,positive
"This movie (easily the best Bond film in years, btw) has a lot of things going for it, namely its sleek screenplay, stunning action sequences, and Daniel Craig's deadly sexy ice-blue stare.",positive
Good typical James Bond movie. But after the first time its boring.,negative
"Initial reaction - not sure. But it has grown on me, and boy is it good, not to mention brutal",positive
"Definitely a New Bond. Gimmicky in places (poker, parcours) but probably the most solid film of the lot.",positive
James Bond does not?DOES NOT?run through walls.,negative
"Une nouvelle ere pour les agents du MI6 avec l'arrivee de Daniel Craig plus charismatique que jamais. Laisses de cote les gadgets en tous genres, ce volet plus noir et plus mature que ces predecesseurs fait une large place a la psychologie complexe et tourmentee de l'agent secret. Un petit bemol neanmoins puisque chronologiquement, l'action du film est censee se passer au moment ou Bond est promu agent double-0, soit avant tous les autres episodes, tout nous rappelle le contraire dont notamment cette reference faites par M. aux attentats du 11 septembre. Mais cela ne gache en rien le plaisir...",positive
Great update to the series. Brings Bond to this century.,positive
"I was never a fan of 007 movies, until this one. Actually, I don't think I am really a fan even now. I just love this one and can forgive some of its cheesiness as it is a 007 movie. Daniel Craig is awesome, the action sequences are mindblowing, the pacing is terrific, the twists although predictable were still thrilling to watch. Yay for Bond. James Bond.",positive
One of the worst 007 movie...,negative
Huge deception for this last 007 movie !,negative
"I hate the out of place introduction to this film. I have no beef with Craig as Bond, and think that his character is decent, however this film should have been much better. Everything from the poker game onwards makes me go a big rubbery one. Having Bond try to copy Bourne was a good idea, a shame that they couldn't make it as good. One star in the mark purely for Eva Green.",negative
This new bond (Daniel Craig) is cool. No gadget stuffs thou... Disappointed... :((,negative
GREAT STUFF WELL ACTED BOND MOVIE,positive
"Pierce Brosnan was an amazig Bond, but Daniel Craig just may be a worthy replacement. He was great as 007 and the film was packed with classic Bond goodness.",positive
I'm glad they realised the last few Bonds were getting a little campy. I was especially fired up when I heard Daniel Craig was gonna be the new 007 because I had seen him in Layercake years before it made it so this side of the pond. A much more accurate portrayal of Bond I think. Excellent all around.,positive
"Crap. It's not a Bond movie. Would have gotten a good score if it didn't have the Bond name. When the bartender asks him ""Shaken or stirred"" and he says ""Does it look like I give a damn,"" I quit...",negative
Good movie. Daniel Craig is an excellent choice for Bond. I can watch this movie over and over.,positive
what a great bond film! Craig is absolutely wonderful...really lived up to the hype!,positive
"kind of curious if this is the direction the franchise wants to take, but it was a lot less geriatric than the other bond movies. kind of got the sense he might've been too buff for a bond.",negative
Can watch over and over!,positive
SO GOOD! Second best Bond ever.,positive
awesome relaunching of series,positive
Daniel Craig = hottay This is one of the few action movies that I like - but that's mostly because of the scene where he almost dies ^-^ I like self sacrificing heroes,negative
I enjoyed this but the first fight scene was unnecessary long. Love Daniel Craig.,negative
"I must admit I enjoy this less everytime I see it. I thought he was a stellar bond the first time I saw him, but I increasingly yearn for the exaggerated sophistication of Pierce Brosnan. Bond isn't supposed to be ultra-realistic, so I don't think we should get too carried away trying to make everything plausible.",negative
"A significant direction change in the 007 movie series. Say goodbye to gadgets, supercars, and larger than life explosions. This production provides a raw and visceral Bond. A genuinely successful film for this era.",positive
Suprisingly rather good!!,positive
Den bÃ¤sta bond film! Om det ska bara vara en bond brud med sÃ¥ ska dom vara som Eva Green :-),positive
Brilliant - my favourite Bond film. An excellent performance by Daniel Craig.,positive
ha! the first bond movie that can actually make me watch the whole thing...after the last two attempts of a movie this one is ...interesting,negative
"This is only the second James Bond movie I've seen and I really liked it! Daniel Craig is not a handsome man, but he's strangely sexy. The story was great (except the ending dragged on) and the action scenes (espeically the opening one) was crazy awesome.",negative
"Daniel Craig does an undeniably fine job as a young ""Bond, James Bond"", portraying a slick as ever, yet rough and ready as well as refreshingly genuine secret agent. With not quite as many gadgets and explosives as its predecessors, this Bond movie instead, plays well with an intriguing plotline, riding high on emotions, tension and character building. Mission accomplished - a fitting introduction to 007.",positive
Different from the previous bond movies. Still entertaining.,negative
Best Bond movie ever.,positive
"if you are going to make a movie with poker...at least use the right poker terms...the begining when bond beats the other guy with 3 aces..he has 2 in the pocket, and 1 on the board...the dealer says trip aces..which is 2 on the board and 1 in the pocket...they should of said...a SET of aces...had to turn it off after that happend..",negative
"Bedre enn de forrige tre 007-filmene, men det skulle bare mangle. De var crap. Og 20 minutter sentimentalt pjatt 2 timer inn i filmen, hva i h... er det for noe!!? Filmen kunne med fordel vart 45 minutter kortere.",negative
La mejor bond movie ever!!!!!!!!,positive
"Just when I thought Bond movies were a waste of time and money, BAM! Best Bond movie yet.",positive
I have seen most of the Pierce Brosnan Bond films and this one blows them out of the water. It's just a really good action movie.,positive
this story redefine high and mighty hero... he suck on being urban ninja.. almost got killed jumping between crane,positive
"I'd have to say the best Bond film I've ever seen. Every scene is done perfectly, and the villains haven't been this nasty since Licence to Kill. Truly amazing.",positive
yup. Nr21 is the nr one,positive
The way every Bond film should be.,positive
Martin Campbell knows how to Bond. An exciting debut by Craig that shows there is life in the old spy yet -- but the film itself is weakened by a patchy second half.,negative
As the biggest bond fan i have to say this is by far the best of the bunch this the Connery dayz. Craig is our,positive
Kaikkien aikojen paras Bond.,positive
If you want to sit on your leather lounge watching old Bond movies go ahead. This is the only Bond movie for me. Can't wait for the next installment.,positive
daniel craig is a damn good bond... and the movie is really good - follows the book!,positive
Fantastic movie. A lot more like I'd expected. Not much emphasise on gadgets but more about why Bond is Bond. Mr Craig is now the Bond of this century. Can't wait for the next installment.,positive
"best bond since ""from russia with love""",positive
"a very good film. its not quite up to par with some of the great bond films, but its close. i found this film particularly interesting because it takes place when james bond is starting out. he just earned his 007 licencse. a new interesting perspective.",positive
Not the best Bond but certainly one of the better ones.,positive
I appreciate the refreshing changes to the bond series.,positive
"Bad ass Bond, a little more like Flemming meant him to be portrayed. No offense to Sir Sean, but Roger Moore, give me a break.... Daniel Craig is the new man",positive
When i heard Daniel Craig was going to be the new Bond I wasn't too happy. I thought that he was a little to rough to get all the ladies. But he worked quite well.,positive
"The best bond movie ever made, great story, great acting by all cast, and great martial art visualization, Daniel Craig is the real and best bond ever, after watching this movie, I don't have the feel to watch other bond movies before",positive
"Danial Craig make s GREAT Bond, he actually makes you feel for and understand the character. His thighs, OMG!!!",positive
"juste un James Bond ... mais avec Daniel Craig, c'est de nouveau la classe ! ouf !",positive
"My first Bond movie. Great fun, especially if you drink a martini along with Mr. Craig.",positive
Daniel Craig is a brilliant James Bond. Excellent movie,positive
Best Bond yet. I liked this much better than the original! You really understand why Bond turns into the womanising man we all know... And that free-running chase at the start... wow.,positive
"The best Bond, fuck Connery.",positive
they get better every time!,positive
this movie is so sick especially the part in the casino,positive
Quite possibly the best Bond movie ever,positive
"Interesting movie, good action.",positive
The best film ever. And I'm a Connery fan. This puts the franchise back to Dr. NO days. Craig kicks ass!,positive
Best Bond movie ever.,positive
"daniel craig gives the bond franchise a kick in the balls. a thrilling action film with some great set pieces - the casino scene standing out. a great example of an action film with brains. greatly looking forward to the next one, my film of 2006.",positive
hm.. updated bond... yet classic,positive
possibly the best james bond movie yet??,positive
Bond is campy...this isn't. Too many pseudo endings.,negative
"wow, this bond sucked: zero car chases and too many cards.",negative
just good... long ending!,negative
"The best James Bond movie ever made!!! The story was great, the acting was superb and i love Daniel Craig. And i have to say that i have cried everytime i watch the last scene with Vesper.",positive
New style 007. No more rely on modern and unrealistic weapons. Daniel Craig is cool. Good casting.,negative
Enjoy thoroughly although I do not think that poker is a sport. I like Daniel Craig and think he has a harder edge to him. Connery still is the best.,positive
It wasn't at level of James Bond's movies,negative
"James Bond is reinvented with what is the first book in Ian Flemming's series. This is Bond's first adventure, hence the semi-younger Daniel Craig as Bond. He is not as suave as the other Bond portrayls, but he brings a much rugged and bad ass image to the Bond series. A good action film, and the opening credit song is still in my head. Worth your time.",negative
Possibly the best Bond movie ever?,positive
"Before this James Bond, I was an unconditional fan of Roger Moore. Not anymore. Daniel Craig has all it takes to make a legendary James Bond. And that body !... Man !... Anyhow, besides that it has everything you expect from this type of movie.",positive
A fabulous rush of blood to the head. Always knew Daniel Craig would make a deliciously masculine Bond...,positive
"et bien moi, j' ai bien aime le bond blond !",negative
gd film one of the best :D,negative
As a spy/action movie it was just about watchable... as a Bond movie it was dreadful. If I want gritty and serious Bond I'll go read the books.,negative
Don't like Daniel Craig as James Bond,negative
"AS THE GREAT FAN OF 007 I LOVED THIS FILM , EXCELLENT FILM , THE DIRECTION BY MARTIN CAMPBELL IS PERFECT ITS HIS BEST FILM, THE STUNTS ARE GREAT THERE IS NO CGI EVRETHING IS DONE OLDSCHOOL, VERY INTENSE ACTION SEQUENCES , AND IT IS BALLANCED WITH THE POKER GAME CLASSIC SCENE FULL OF SUSPENSE, THE INITIAL PARKOUR CHASE IS ONE OF THE BEST ,AND THE BEST PART THE ASTON MARTIN SCENE UNFURTUNALY IT ROLLS 7 TIMES AND GETS ALL BEAT UP , BUT IT BEAT A GUINNES RECORD ,THE INTRO SCENE IS THE BEST IN ANY BOND FILM TAKEN FROM THE BOOK COVER AND THE SCORE BY DAVID ARNOLD WITH CHRIS CORNELL SONG ""YOU KNOW MY NAME"" THE BEST BOND SONG EVER AND MY FAVORITE !!!!!!! SINCE THE FILM STARTS FROM THE GUN BARREL SEQUENCE YOU CANT BLINK , EXCELLENT FILM , I MISS PIERCE BROSNAN AS BOND BUT THE FILM IS SO GOOD , I LOVE IT ITS JUST THE BEST JAMES BOND FILM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",positive
He has been very very sexy...,positive
i went to the movies to see this. I wasnt expecting much because im not a massivbe james bond fan. But this movie was great. By far my favourite james bond movie!!!!,positive
An excellent re-boot of the James bond films. Daniel Craig puts the grit back into 007.,positive
"My first Bond movie actually, and it set a very high standard for all the 'previous' Bond movies I haven't seen! Bond Lynd romance was a little protracted though towards the end. Daniel Craig was excellent, he looked the part of a spy. Can't wait for Bond 22!",positive
"This film was nothing short of excellent. It's a nice new look at the Bond movies and a start in a new direction. I think Daniel Craig is the best Bond in several movies. It's a gripping, action-packed movie that's worth multiple viewings.",positive
"Enfin un Bond oÃ¹ je ne m'emmerde pas, oÃ¹ l'homme est crÃ©dible...un relaunch du mythe, modernisÃ© mais trÃ¨s proche du roman de Flemming.",positive
Bring back Sean connery,negative
"Not bad. I didn't think I'd like it. But I was pleasantly surprised. Bond wasn't as awful as I thought he'd be and Eva Green was very charming. This was a smart movie, I was pleased to find and made me want to see the next one.",negative
Best foot chase ever in a movie.,positive
Much better than I thought it would be.,positive
I thought it was one of the best 007 movies,negative
well written and bravely open-ended. Eva Green was great in this.,positive
"The first Bond film to hold my interest all the way through. Many good things - Eva Green, fantastic opening and closing action setpieces, Eva Green - it's generally great. Kickass theme song too.",positive
"Daniel Craig, forgive me for doubting you. Eva Green, you are very hot.",positive
"A great start to Daniel Criags stint as Bond. Kept reasonably in the realm of possibility (for a bond film at least), the stunts are still spectacular as are the locations. I could have dne without the last 20 mins or so but even that is still better then most movies.",positive
Not as gd as the other ones but still gd.Cant wait still the next ones.,positive
"Terrible, a shameful travesty of Bond",negative
"I really enjoyed the film. Besides, the opening scene with Chris Cornell's song (you know my name) is worth watching..",positive
just the best bond ! georgous,positive
Give it a feeling...,negative
Craig makes an awesome debut as Bond as he returns back to the roots of 007,positive
"Very good James Bond, looking forward to the next one.",positive
I love a bit of Bond!,positive
"good, i loved the action scenes, especially the stunts on the crane and around that part, when he goes after that one black guy.",negative
quite like this Bond even though he's a duck face,negative
Craig is a good Bond. A bit less un-real,positive
"I've never seen a single James Bond flick, but this one looks really good.",positive
"Oh man, I love this movie! I liked how they brought the gadget levels down, and it was a more physical arena.",positive
"Although I never saw the original, this one wasn't too bad. Not as much action as you'd expect from such a long movie, but definitely worth seeing.",positive
Best bond movie in a long time,positive
FACT - Best James Bond Film,positive
"For me, Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever. He actually looks like he could be a spy, not a GQ model.",positive
"""Would you like your martini shaken or stirred?."" ""Does it look like I give a damn?"" ""Casino Royale"" forgets the Bond of before and reinvents 007 into the hardboiled agent that he was meant to be. Gone are the inventive gadgets, invisible cars, and witty attitude that we have all come to expect of Mr. Bond. Daniel Craig has redefined the British agent for ""Casino Royale"", and rightfully so. The film takes Bond back to his beginnings as 007, before he became the sly fox that others have portrayed. Here, Bond is as cold as ever, woman are pushed aside, gadgets are turned off and finesse is thrown out the window. The film's plot is still as over the top as ever, but unlike films of the past, it is still somewhat grounded in reality, which gives the film much more depth then the series has ever had before. That's not to say the action is any lower, the opening scene in Madagascar is one of the most exciting and dynamic scenes in Bond history for a matter of fact. This is the 21st Bond film and the sixth Bond in over forty years. If ""Casino Royale"" is any indication, the series is in good hands.",positive
Who would not love to see Daniel craig come out of the sea half naked. Woohoo,positive
"Waaaaay too hyped. It failed to grip me right from the start, and when the credits rolled I just didn't feel like anything had really happened other then a overly long single poker game. Everyone raved about Craig being the new Bond, but there simply was no emotion in his acting at all. Severly disappointing.",negative
The Best Bond Movie!,negative
"Perhaps THE best bond film to date, Daniel Craig is superb, the story is excellent! Has everything a top Bond film must have",positive
"Objectively, this is probably a very good film, though as a fan of the camp, cheesy ear I have to say that it just wasn't my kind of think. If I wanted high-octane action, I'd watch a Bourne film, and without appalling one-liners, this one was lacking for me. Also, as someone who doesn't understand poker, I was lost for half of it! On a brighter note, the action was of high-quality and I felt that the plot (bar the poker) kept me interested. A credit to reboots!",negative
An excellent reboot of a classic franchise. Daniel Craig is the most realistic and hardcore Bond yet.,positive
"This film is everything that you have already read: gritty, realistic 'Bourne'-ish and to boot it is a good story with some defined characters. I think Craig is a great choice for this style and Eva Green is also a great fit. The early chase sequence is another classic. As long as you remember that this is a Bond film, therefore not everything will make perfect sense (I found the scenes where he is on the phone to everyone back in London slightly strange) then you will be fine. I also think this film meanders a little towards the end, but you can't have everything.",positive
Great action moive! And I love it cause Mark says the girl in it reminds him of me:),positive
"Took FOREVER to get this rights cleared, but they certainly tried to make the most of it. Think it saved the franchise, Shoulda done SOMETHING with the car though",positive
"Am normally not a big fan of Bond movies, but did really enjoy this one. Was action packed with lots of twists and turns.",positive
spot on bond film excellent,positive
I liked it. Action Packed,positive
Pretty good movie with the new James Bond. Love the start of the movie with all the runnings and stuff.,positive
best bond since Tim Dalton,positive
he's a really great 007...worthy to be bond!,negative
picture perfect. i love 007!!!,positive
Still not sure of the re-imagining of bond yet!,negative
I found it to be sexy and better than I thought. Was glad I saw it.,positive
"Action/thriller yes, Bond film, not sure...",negative
"Mmmm, new Bond, sexy Daniel Craig... I like it.",positive
"well, it's really well done, definitely the best bond yet... but I also found it incredibly depressing.",negative
I admit i was alittle shaky of watching this movie since daniel craig is usually in something very boring & long but this movie has clssic written all over it.,positive
"A Great Remake, open scene q little much for one to beleive, after all ribs do break. But great action and it will be in the collection",positive
"La primera pelicula del 007 que me aguanto, buenisima. de verdad me gusto. Daniel Craig es el mejor 007 de la historia he dicho.",positive
"i like it... and i HATE bond films, so it must have been good!",negative
Best of al James Bonds - this guy is hot!,positive
"i've only seen this film once but i loved it. i was fully prepared to be extremely sceptical, (can a person really defib themselves?!?) but i was pleasantly suprised, i think the poker scene could drag on repeat viewing but overall, i liked it.",positive
Really good. I like the addition of Daniel Craig as the new James Bond. The first chase scene with the cranes was phenomenal.,positive
"The only problems with this movie are its inconsistencies with the rest of the James Bond movie series. They don't make it any less enjoyable, however. Great movie for any genre.",positive
Best bond possibly ever. i cannot fault it.,positive
Best Bond movie in ages.,positive
Craig is a good choice for Bond. The story is great while still keeping the winning formula of Bond flicks!,positive
Best James Bond I think I have ever seen. Great movie fantastic action.,positive
"Any film that can make me watch a James Bond film has to be good. My first experience of James Bond, loved it. Daniel Craig is a great Bond after a lot of speculation about whether he was the right man for the job. The film is the answer really: Yes.",positive
Best Bond film in years...,negative
"Basically, the perfect movie",positive
Quite possibly the best Bond yet. And--since the 007 series doesn't exactly put up the toughest of fights--a very competent action/drama in its own right.,positive
Mmmm probably the best bond yet!!! loved the nod to Ursula!!,negative
Haven't seen an opening sequence as intense as this one since Raiders of the Lost Ark and Saving Private Ryan. Not just the best Bond movie but one of the best action movies to date.,positive
A decent movie. This seems to be the Bond film for those that don't like Bond films. It shys away from pyrotechnics and endless action sequences in attempt to build more tension. A welcome change from the tedium that has become Brosnan's trademark.,negative
"The product whoring by Sony Corp. is just plain irritating, but to mark the film down for that would be unfair to the cast, the acting is great all-round, and Craig plays Bond as he always should have been; Ruthless, dirty and a complete bastard, but oh-so charismatic...",positive
Love this movie on the big screen. Daniel Craig is a bada$$ Bond and the action was fast. With the right amount of Romance as well.,positive
"This was a decent Bond effort. He was suave, yes, and there were a few lovely ladies as per usual, however, they toned down the Bond-cheese here and replaced that with a steely, hard wanker of a Bond which was quite amusing to watch. I don't normarily enjoy these kinds of films but it was certainly an amusing watch...",negative
Best. Bond. Ever. That's right. What can I say? I don't much care for the oldies...,positive
"A well-needed reboot for 007. To me this is the first film where it's IAN FLEMING's James Bond-a brutal, ridig, unwavering assassin",positive
Daniel Craig- Yum Yum!!,negative
"Pas mal, mais je regrette beaucoup Pierce Brosnan et ses prÃ©dÃ©cesseurs...",negative
Back to basics - can watch this over again!!,positive
daniel craig and eva green need i say more?,positive
"Filmen andas pengar. Allt ar ruskigt valproducerat, snyggt och putsat. Oppningsjakten ar en av de basta actionsekvenser jag sett nagonsin och Craig gor sig utmÃ¤rkt som Bond. Dock tycker jag filmen tappar fart i pokern, som dessutom alltid ska vara sa overdriven. man kan faktiskt vinna pa annat an straight flush! Slutet var ocksa forbryllande da man tror att det Ã¤r slut fast det bara fortsatter utan nagon given riktning...",negative
Even people who hate Bond films will enjoy this. Daniel Craig does a fantastic job as 007 and you'll def fancy him even if you're male!,positive
I liked the bringing of Bond into a new era where he spends more time doing his job than doing women. Judi Dench as M was also a good move.,positive
Its ok but again this film was to long and I was sat there like what the hec? So nah not my favorite film.,negative
Bond is back and better than ever! This film was defiantly a challenge for both Daniel Craig and the Directors after all they had to have immense tension around a poker table which is hard for a blood thirsty audience such as the usual bond crowd who's idea of tension is a gun to someone's head not turning over two pieces of card. This was masterfully gun and defiantly has got a lot of people interested in poker. Craig was amazing and if he keeps this up he may be my knew favorite Bond. The only problem was the film went on for ages. But who cares it was amazing.,positive
"Althought Daniel Craig's a little wooden, he's half a bad James Bond. I'd rate him above Dalton and Moore, but below Brosnan and Connery. But given I think he could really develop well. Plot was great, and the free-running scene in the beginning was fantastic. Throroughly enjoyed!",positive
"Fantastic film. Includes all the usual Bond moments. Not the best Bond movie out there, but still worth a watch.",positive
ok not a movie masterpiece...does have it faults.....but kick ass!!!........finally a Bond you would not fuck with!...pointless gadgets and time waisting sexual excepades out the window. Stripped down and raw is the way to go......altough you'd expect Craig to have spent a little more time in the gym......lllaaaaazzzyyyyy.........,positive
A brilliant new Bond movie - Craig will be a top 007,positive
Nice movie. I liked the starting chase with parkour jumping. Also the part James drinks Chateau Angelus ( i have 1 bottle of it),positive
not best james bond film ever bt is great,positive
"Pretty good, my 1st Bond movie sadly enough, but I enjoyed it a lot! I have to say Daniel Craig is awsome, makes for a good detached killer, Eva Green is gorgeous, I thought it had a good mix of action with romance.",positive
The best James Bond movie period,positive
one of the best bond movies yet. It wasnt as action packed but it was very entertaining,positive
very good just too long,positive
I like the gritty no frills James Bond.,positive
"not like the other Bond movies, but still incredibly entertaining",positive
"Wow i was not expecting such a great movie! Just when u think its over it picks back up, and again! Great Debut for the new Bond! Great Movie! Definately killing the first Casino's curse!",positive
My first James Bond movie and I really like it! I love all the action and adventure! Now I can't wait to watch the old ones!,positive
"I'm not a huge fan of Daniel Craig, but it was refreshing to see a James Bond dress ""down""! Eva Green is absolutely stunning - If I had to be Italian, I'd want to look like her! Mads Mikkelsen is my hearthrob - he's a Danish replica of my absolute favorite male model, Noah Mills! Very stylish film!",positive
"Excellent Bond Movie, so many twists!",positive
"This is the film that rejuvinated the Bond franchise and it's the best Bond film to date in my opinion.Daniel Craig is amazing in the film,definitely the best Bond since Connery,maybe even better than Connery and Eva Green gives another sensational performance and the relationship between her and Craig is the backbone of the film.The action scenes are amazing and the film has something i've haven't seen alot of in the Bond movies,depth.One of my all time favourite films.",positive
Action is awesome. Cute guy! But...he drove a Ford!!! Nothing next to the Aston Martin!,positive
The car is not jaguar... pitty...,positive
probably my favourite bond,positive
"007 at his best.. stirred, not shaken!",negative
Brought Bond back to life. Took out all the gadgets and nonsense and made him real.,positive
"An extremely overrated Bond affair. On it's own, it works, but in the context of the series as a whole it's just frustrating.",negative
"Craig is a crazy-great Bond, he is dirty and gritty, and I love it.. this one really took me by surprise, and I am glad that it came out the way that it did.. and Eva.. whew... rockin' action movie, great Bond addition!!",positive
"The perfect Bond. More, please!",positive
"A bit slow in a couple of parts, ....BUT I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!",positive
if u lyk action ull luv this,positive
By far one of the best Bonds I've seen!! And the only Bond to rival Connery!,positive
"I'm not a real ""Bond"" fan, but this movie was an incredible ride. I hope they make a lot more that build on what was accomplished in this movie.",positive
Completely changed my view on James Bond,positive
aweomse bond movie. my favorite yet!,positive
"This was actually the first James Bond movie I've seen from beginning to end, no joke! And if I'm honest, it was AMAZING! And it wasn't just Daniel Craig's body that was amazing too! The fight scenes, the gadgets, what a movie huh? It really was awesome! I thought Vesper (Eva Green) was pretty evil by doing what she did, and to think they were getting along so well! Anyways, deffo a 5 star movie! Loved it!",positive
"The first Bond movie i really like. He's the Anti-Bond. This guy actually bleeds! He's athletic, credible and not as mushy and over0the-top as his predecessors.",positive
very good movie.kinda different from the other bond movies but equally as popular.,positive
Daniel Craig reinvents 007 (and does so incredibly well).,positive
"Best Bond (movie) Ever. I don't care if he's blond. That's a stupid,arbitrary thing to be arguing about, people! Sure, Connery had the grace and the swagger, Pierce actually LOOKED like Fleming's description of Bond, but those movies, and I love them all, even ""License To Kill"", but not ONE of them is the MOVIE that this was. Most stylish, best shot, best made Bond. Hands down.",positive
"good, but the blatent advertisng is annoying",positive
"Not a Bond fan, never have been..but this new darker Bond is much, much more absorbing. Hope the next one is anywhere near as good.",positive
"Great film and cast. Enough said. Torture scene looked painful, except for you alex, no offence.",positive
"high octane action sequences, arousing plot, and the best james bond since sean connery thanx 2 a surprising daniel craig performance",positive
"Its good but I just didn't like it for some reason...the BOND formula seemed to have been ""ruined""........its a bit harsh I know...ah well. ;)",negative
Found the story a little slow at times but overall Craig did a fantastic job as the new bond - he's a much darker and human bond which I think is a refreshing change for the overall series - not as many stupid one liners either which I also enjoyed,positive
A cut above the usual Bond exercise; unusually somber. Casting of Eva Green (from The Dreamers) is a stroke of genius.,negative
Daniel is the real Bond 007 !!!,positive
Just watched this for the second time and I appreciate it even more though I already gave it 5 stars after the first viewing. I've seen Mikkelsen in Danish movies before. This was I believe the first English language movie I have seen him in and he killed it as the villian.,positive
Daniel Craig looks like a monkey.,negative
"Yay, a Bond film worth seeing. Critics were quite harsh on Daniel Craig but I think he did a great job. So they can all jump in a lake. Also they finally ditched all the ridiculous gadgets (invisible cars anyone?) and Bond's over-the-top chauvinist ways. Downside: most awesome car chase scene stopped before it even started.",negative
The film that changed the life and legacy of the one and only James Bond 007...Could Daniel really be better than Sean??,positive
Bond is back... and as Daniel Craig... well... what can I say? ;) Damn!,positive
the new James Bond is quite handsome.,positive
"Daniel Craig is NOT James Bond, and Mads Mikkelsen is NOT Le Chiffre. Third and most horrible rendition of Ian Fleming's immortal story.",negative
"a new, old(er) james bond",positive
Awesome film! One of the best!,positive
My favorite Bond movie yet.,negative
"Bond is back... Daniele Craig plays an excellent role. Bond is not an ultimate superhero here. Hope to see Craig in future as a Bond, James Bond.",positive
too many places where they should have ended it but didn't,negative
Daniel rocks as the MI6 agent and Eva's performance is just as beautiful as she is. This is the only bond movie I own,positive
"Perhaps the least likely looking Bond to play the role, Craig puts his stamp on the character and makes it his own. As a die-hard fan, he's a pleasant surprise...can't wait for the next one.",positive
"Surprised at how much I actually liked Daniel Craig as the new Bond. The actor who plays Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) is pretty smoking hot, too.",positive
kept me awake from a well deserved nap,negative
I was among the many who thought Daniel Craig was gonna be an aweful Bond. Well looks like im eatin crow now cause he was great and this is one of the best Bond movies of all time.,positive
YES! They finaly humanized Bond!,positive
better bond of recent years,positive
"Its good! revamped a flagging genre, and daniel Craig is convincing and a good change in style for Bond. Packed with action and for a change bond getting the odd cut and bruise.",positive
Daniel Craig IS James Bond! & Judi Dench is the shit.,negative
Daniel Craig is one sexy guy!,positive
"This re-establishes Bond as a bad-ass, a la the Batman Begins series. And I like that.",positive
"Good, but what happened to Bond he isn't suave and sophisticated anymore but I do like the gritty feel. If they could balance this it would awesome.",negative
"Even though I don't like Daniel Craig as Bond, I did like the movie.",negative
Hate James Bond but this is good,negative
Daniel Craig is the best James Bond yet.,positive
Bond is back! Daniel Craig hits this one out the park and brings the bad ass back to the character. Eva Green was also fantastic in her role. Overall one of the best Bond movies period.,positive
Daniel Craig is quite possibly the best James Bond the franchise has ever seen,positive
Modern Day re-imagining of James Bond is a spellbinding adrenaline rush!,positive
"Inte illla alls, fÃ¶r att vara en James Bondfilm. Gillar skarpt nÃ¥gra av ""jaga-bov-scenerna"" i bÃ¶rjan. Och att Mr Bond kan strunta i om Dry Martinin Ã¤r omrÃ¶rd eller skakad... i alla fall nÃ¤r livet stÃ¥r pÃ¥ spel.",negative
best bond movie ever.,positive
Wow I wished I had seen this film before now this film was really good. Theres only one thing that could of been improved I think they could of had a better story because there was all action and it wasn't going into much of a story like if you look at films like The Rock that as lots of action and a really interesting story this doesn't it as lots of action but not an really interesting story. Overall this film was really good and is worth watching but this film wasn't materpiece but its worth a few watches.,positive
"I'm speechless, Daniel Craig is indescribable, the movie is huge success, prosperity & ongoing success to Daniel especially in the coming Bond movies...",positive
"Bad ass Bond rocks, and there are poker scenes. Gets a little silly at the end, but it's a Bond movie, what do you expect?",positive
"I've never really liked James Bond movies until I saw this one. Daniel Craig is simply amazing at playing James Bond. For once, it's not the same bullet-proof unbeatable Bond. This time there's actually a conflict. This time the plot actually makes sense. For the first time, a 007 movie actually deserves some applause.",positive
Craig's not a bad Bond.,negative
Film solidement bon qui vaut la peine d'etre vu. Surement le meilleur des James Bond!,positive
"Very cool, Bond movies were normally the reserve for the Bank Holiday and Xmas, but this brought it bang upto date! Great action and Daniel Craig after one movie is one of the best Bonds ever!",positive
Excellent. Le meilleur Bond,positive
bond's rebooted/remade resorting back 2 basics as each prior mission got more bloated+ridiculous. craig finally breaks thru carrying a film. action is raw/real stuntwork amt'ing to a great actioner. i can't wait for the next one!,positive
Shaken or stirred? Do I look like I care?,positive
A Bond film that downplays the gadgets and actually provides some depth to Bond's character.,positive
pierce never really fit bond for me.. but daniel craig does. best bond movie to date,positive
HOLY SH*T was this move dope! Daniel Craig is an amzing James Bond. This is how I've always wanted Bond films to be like. I have been a bond fan for a long time. Each and every actor to play Bond gave the films a special something...Daniel Craig does that plus more.,positive
"Remarkable action movie of the millennium! 'Now the whole world's gonna know that you died scratching my balls! ' - James Bond 'Vesper Lynd: Am I going to have a problem with you, Mr. Bond? James Bond: No, don't worry, you're not my type. Vesper Lynd: Smart? James Bond: Single.' M: You don't trust anyone, do you? James Bond: No. M: Then you've learned your lesson. ' James Bond: 'The job's done and the bitch is dead..' James Bond: Vodka-martini. Bartender: Shaken or stirred? James Bond: Do I look like I give a damn? 'James Bond: The name's Bond... James Bond..' 9/10.",positive
"It is a shift from the usual James Bond. Less funny, less gadgets, but tougher. Daniel Craig wears the JB suit quite well.",negative
"have to say i was proven wrong daniel craig is a good actor! and he does fit the 'bond' role... loved the scene..."" everyone will know you died scratching my balls"" lol",positive
"Best Bond Movie I have seen in years. Daniel Craig is probably the perfect choice for this role. He lets Pierce Brosman look like a sissy and left me wondering why was old Piercy chosen in the first place. That aside, the return to the previous style of Bond is more than welcome. The Bond movie before was so over the top, it became unbelievable. This movie relies rather on solid action and believable scenes and pulls the Bond name from the mud of the previous two movies.",positive
The other day at work I was actually in a foot chase just like the one at the begining of this film...,positive
"maybe whenever a new bond comes in there first one will always be good. This one just seemed better done, it didn't follow the rigid formula",positive
This was the best Bond movie since A View To A Kill....but a hell of a lot better. Very Gritty. Finally..a bad ass Bond.,positive
"Bond is usually shit, but this one is hardcore and almost ""realistic"" 5 star cause they made Bond worth seeing!",positive
"Craig is the best thing to happen to Bond since Connery. He added a human dimension to a the standard cocktail sipping womanizer, made him look like a real spy. Haggis' screenplay includes the sharp Bond humor with none of the inane and blatant innuendo which hindered the Brosnan flicks, and the action was remarkable. Can't wait for the next one.",positive
thought it would be stupid.. and i was right..,negative
"Just face it, Daniel Craig is the Bond.",positive
i still like Brosnan's movies better but this one was good,positive
The best Bond movie by far! Daniel Craig's bod was to die for!,positive
"One of the top 5 Bonds, which is good because things were starting to slip at the end with Brosnan. Craig brings new energy to the role of Bond. Coupled with a great story, intense actions scenes, and a solid supporting job from Eva Green, this is a worthy entry into the Bond canon.",positive
"It was fairly good as a movie, typical bond stuff. But the ending was 1. very confusing 2. setting up for a sequel",negative
"The best Bond movie ever. When James Bond hits a guy, it actually looks like it hurts.",negative
"In my opinion, the best bond film so far- actually had realistic bad guys in it this time!",positive
"a great mix of action, plot, and sharp little burns in the dialogue. There's a great underlying theme relating to Bond's development as the Bond we know him to be... Throughout the movie, even from the very first scene it's about him needing/wanting to prove himself and in every key scene his overwhelming desire to prove his abilities (or capabilities?) costs him dearly...how many times could he have saved himself a lot of trouble just by shutting up? ...for example.",positive
"i really like the character transformation - the grittier, rough around the edges, less polished bond. thought this film was stylish and fantastic.",positive
kabhi meri yaaad ae toh loat aana ok,positive
So much hype for this movie and so much disappointment.,negative
Best bond movie ever!,positive
"The best Bond movie yet sees Craig give Bond a real ruthless edge, whilst still able to show his passion for the ladies. All the other lead roles very good and the story has some depth",positive
Easily a Top 5 Bond film.,positive
"Once again, James Bond is cool to me. I liked this one a lot but the Bond girl looks like a mutant.",positive
"Never was much of a fan of the James Bond series, and this movie does not do anything for me either. Rather disjointed plot, and very predictable.",negative
best bond film yet cant wait for 22,positive
Daniel Craig is very cool,positive
action pact and very interesting,negative
Excellent Bond film. This film was much more realistic than all the others so far. Daniel Craig could be the best Bond - he brings a certain menace to Bond that the others never had. The film was also a lot morelike a traditional action flick. I was suitably impressed and am looking forward to the next installment.,positive
"Bond re-invented. How wonderful to finally shake off the old heritage. Modern, fresh, smart in a way Bond hasn't been for years. A few more cuts in the middle and it would've been perfect.",positive
Best Bond movie ever.,positive
"Never saw a Bond movie before Brosnan's ones. They were ok but didn't grip me. Then I saw this one last year. This one did grip me! The humor, the action, the women. This is a great film.",positive
"This reinvention of the series really did help. Copying the slightly more realistic approach of the Bourne trilogy provided a grittier more involving drama, while still including the huge classic Bond set pieces. And although some people said he couldn't do it, I though Daniel Craig made a very capable Bond, although there was a little too much pout. And there is still a bit too much product placement. Apart from that, jolly good film.",positive
best bond movie i ever seen,positive
"I liked seeing the origin story. Something about Casino Royale reminds me of Unbreakable and Batman Begins. Maybe the connection is obvious. Anyway, of those movies, I felt happiest about this one, but it is probably the most conventional. Still, it isn't exactly conventional, especially compared to its James Bond predecessors, and I was struck particularly by the way Daniel Craig slowly became recognizable as the character we know. So one side of this movie is surprisingly conventional, and another is surprisingly effective and subtly unconventional. I hope that doesn't sound like utter nonsense. See it!",positive
"The first time we've seen Fleming's Bond from the books in action. Fantastic film that passes the 'Bourne' test - i.e. Bond would stand a chance against Bourne. Fast paced, edgy and ruthless.",positive
"I feel that I should give this movie another chance, because everyone else came out praising it, and I left kind of disappointed.",negative
If You Have A Blu-Ray Player Get This Movie It's 100 Times Better Than On Dvd,positive
Best Bond film since the days of Connery.... I don't care about the fact that they started Bond again but set it now... it worked! Would have been nice to have Money Penny though!,positive
Daniel Graig is The Bond.,positive
"I won't make big claims yet, but Daniel Craig could be the second best Bond behind Connery. Only time will tell. Best Bond of the Modern Era with Goldeneye a close second.",positive
"Probably should have been or be rated R, many parts were horribly traumatic. It is what it is and that is not friendly. It is mostly predictable, especially if you have seen this type of movie in the past.",negative
"This new bond film is really good, they went back to basics and it worked. this one of the best bond that I haven seen so far.",positive
"I didn't want to give this a 4 cause everything else has a 4. It's a good number. Anyway, Craig was the man at Bond. Great action, nice story, and way to go at keeping the legacy going.",positive
"Easily the best Bond film since the Connery era. Thankfully all the silliness and over-the-top gadgets that plagued the last few Brosnan Bond films are gone! 007 is once again gritty and realistic....just as he originally was in stories like From Russia With Love. I'll admit I was one of the many who were skeptical of Daniel Craig taking over the role, but he exceeded my expectations in every way. Well, it also helped he had a fantastic script to work with. I'm glad they kept the majority of it as close to Ian Fleming's novel as possible. Amazing action sequences, a great supporting cast, terrific music by David Arnold, and some fine character development make this the best Bond in over 30 years.",positive
"Daniel Craig does a good job as bond. Give him darker hair tough. Def. better than pierce. Besides that, i loved this movie. The mixing of old and new. Old cars. New technology. Just great stuff.",positive
"For me this was the second worst Bond movie (after the Lazenby debacle). The one redeeming line comes when Craig is accused of probably wearing a Rolex and he gives a withering stare before saying ""Omega!""",negative
My favorite Bond movie yet. I loved how it was Bond before he got all cocky and depended on gadgets. A great film that reveals the Bond that we all know.,positive
"Oh wow, I didn't think Bond could get sexier than Sean Connery. Daniel Craig is so edgy, I can't wait for another!",positive
"Great acting, good action and a solid plot.",positive
"Not being a Bond fan,I thought Daniel Craig was a good choice. Full of action, it kept my attention.",positive
Wa kinda ugly Bond dis? Man look like him work a factory,negative
Gets better the more times you watch it. Some phenomenal scenes and plausible origins storyline.,positive
"That I would give this movie five stars is surprising to even me. I'm not a Bond fan, per se, but Craig as Bond was an outstanding choice and he does not disappoint. This was a great film.",positive
"I absolutely loved it, it was great action and it wasn't full of crap that it didn't need to be. The movie was anticipating and even thrilling at parts, and also has some romance. Daniel Craig puts forth the biggest and best part I have seen of the Bonds, and Eva Green and Mikkelsen really set it off nicely. It was one of those movies that you can actually follow, which is nice, and the choreography is done well. I recommend to anyone that they should buy this movie!",positive
"Finally, a Bond who's a human being, not a series of cliches and in-jokes that look like a human being.",positive
Best Bond movie recently made. Suffers from some confusion in the last part.,positive
"Daniel Craig as Bond is good. The movie, overall' is better than average.",positive
Daniel Craig's blue swimming suit? Anyone?,positive
Daniel Craig is so good as Bond!,positive
"not much action like other bond movies. still, a cool flick",negative
My favourite bond movie.,positive
Craig performs good as Mr. Bond. Entertaining all the way.,negative
"Bond, a very good ""bad"" bond.",positive
my fav bond movie next to gold member..,positive
"The best Bond in the last twenty years. An excellent way to start a new, and believable, Bond. Craig looked the roll, which is more than I can say for Brosnan. Can't wait to see the next one.",negative
My favorite Bond movie so far (I've seen them all). It follows pretty much the book.,positive
"I love Daniel Graig as James Bond, the best Bond ever.",positive
This was the rebooting that the franchise needed.,positive
BEST JAMES BOND EVER!!!! How can 48% of the reviewers not be interested in it? They obviously know nothing.,positive
Aika mÃ¤iskettÃ¤. Uusi bondi aivan venÃ¤lÃ¤isen nÃ¤kÃ¶inen.,positive
Scartch his balls!!! lol,positive
The Ultimate James Bond,positive
I love Daniel Craig! The movie was good too!,positive
It's the first Bond movie I've actually been able to make it through.,positive
Excellent refresh of a franchise that was dying. A blond Bond...i was sceptical but Daniel Craig is the man.,positive
Daniel Craig is an amazing Bond and the one 007 that can actually act. Casino Royal is packed with great action and Danish actor Mikkelsen must be the best baddie since Jaws . Bond has completely reinvented itself! By it today!!,positive
"I'd give it 5, but I still don't understand why what happened in the end happened. Gritty and entertaining.",positive
Can honestly say that this is the best James Bond movie made yet. Daniel Craig is a freaking pimp.,positive
"Some people said there was too much poker playing in this movie. I would like to ask them what they're smoking. The plot was based nearly entirely arround the bet he placed on that poker game , so it would only make sense for there to be a couple minutes of poker playing. It really wasn't even as much as I would have expected.",negative
"Back to basics, after some sucky bond movies. And it works, the best bond movie in a long time.",positive
"Best Bond-movie ever made!Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever aswell! I really love it! Lots of nice action and stunt choreograpgy, and right to the point, with no cheesy nonsense. And what makes it even better is that you get to see his beautyful body...",positive
"A good action movie for those who either haven't seen old Bond movies or haven't liked them. On the other hand if you are a ""fan"" of the real deal this film is going to irritate you. I don't think Martin Campbell has understanded the whole Bond concept right and maybe because of that the whole updated Bond-idea goes horribly wrong. Big part of this failure to catch the original Bond feeling is few mistakes in casting. Daniel Craig is suitable as a action man but definitely not as a Bond. Eva Green is pretty but not a Bond girl-type at all. Maybe the year 2000 means texas hold'em and parcour but to me those are just lame ideas for a movie.",negative
Best bond film ever made..,positive
One of my favorites. An AWESOME James Bond. I <3 Daniel Craig,positive
"Solid spy-action, and a standout performance by Craig in his Bond debut--all players up and down the cast were superb frankly. It's a wonder what awesome-ness can be had when actually following the stellar plot of an author's work.",positive
"Finally, a Bond film that doesn't feel dated.",positive
Another good Bond film.,positive
"Could be the best Bond ever...following the lead of Bourne, there are less gadgets and this sets the scene for so many things that we see and love in the Bond franchise. Craig (despite my misgivings from previous films) performs very well and Eva Green (as always) lights up the screen. Add to that a grat soundtrack (that doesn't rely toomuch on horns - as the others do) and a brilliant chase scene at the start and you have the perfect mix for a Bond film...Lets hope the next ones follow suit (pardon the pun).",positive
I was a bit apprehensive about Craig in the beginning but he was awesome.,positive
"The best Bond to come along in quite some time. It's dark, action-filled, and everything a Bond movie should be.",positive
"Welcome back, Mr. Bond.",positive
"Nearly ruptured myself jumping at the end. Loved it, Daniel Craig, mmm",positive
"def my favorite Bond movie, aside from Sean Connery-Bond films...this one he's edgier...no cheesy nonsense...",positive
YllÃ¤ttÃ¤vÃ¤n hyvÃ¤. Daniel Craig oli itse asiassa aika jees. Suosittelen!,negative
Best bond since Sean Connery.,positive
The first half was good. I fell asleep for the second.,negative
"lame, predictable, daniel craig is the worst james bond ever!",negative
If it's not Pierce it's not Bond...,negative
The best James Bond protrayal I have x=seen so far. Caniel craig is awesome!!!,positive
"cant beat sean connery but it was alright daniel craig was okay, and CHRIS CORNELL DID THEME SONG!!",positive
"Finally saw it. I liked it. Lots of action - really good stunt choreography - and not as cheesy as the other Bond movies - a good ""intro"" to James Bond",negative
"It's not the best Bond movie of them all, but it's close. Daniel Craig reboots the franchise with his new badass version of Bond -- something that's been sorely needed ever since Connery left so many years ago. The best Bond movie in decades. If you don't agree, you're either a knuckle-dragging moron, or a closet Remington Steele fan. Either way, you suck.",negative
Best Bond movie ever.,positive
One of the top 5 Bond films in my book.,positive
Best Bond movie ever made.,positive
Daniel Craig IS Bond. I never thought anyone could beat Brosnan but Craig has brought the macho back. And those little blue swimming shorts.,positive
"Best Bond movie. The old ones with Sean Connery are good, but seem mysoginstic and dated. This movie rocked.",positive
esta pelicula siii q me gusto.... de primero pense q daniel craig no era el ideal para ser james bond pero... nada que Ver!! me gusta mucho como actua y si la hace super bn de bond,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond.,positive
had some memorable parts... like when hes tied to the chair... ouch...,positive
Yeah -- Bond is fun again.,negative
love this movie and especially when i watch it with sophie she has a 007 dance,positive
Le meilleur des James Bond / Best James Bond ever !,positive
"Now this is a James Bond movie. Criag looks like the kind of guy you wouldn't hide your wife from, but you'd lose her anyways. He's so rugged he makes Patrick Swayze in Red Dawn look like Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing.",positive
Saw this in New York City on 26th Dec 2006! I don't usually like James Bond films either but this was a 'must-see' - TWICE!,positive
"An excellent Bond adventure that stands up to repeat viewing, unlike the previous three Bronsnan outings. Craig is the best Bond since Connery and this outing is up there with the best of the series. Apart from the unnecessary Venice showdown and the Swiss Nursing home sequence which stalls the film dreadfully this is a fast paced and action packed outing.",positive
Best Bond film ever!,positive
luv all bonds flicks...Dainel Craig didn't an amazing job as Bond,positive
"brilliant...Daniel has revamped 007 big time, finally James Bond gets to come into the 21st century!",positive
The only Bond that made me want to see those films :],positive
"ok, daniel craig shouldnt be playin Bond",negative
best bond movie ever keeps u glued start to finnish waz not sure about daniel craig but he excels as bond cant wait for the next installment,positive
"Bond returns and I dare to say he is the best ever! Human, emotional and still awesome!",positive
best james bond film made,positive
"I'm not really a fan of the franchise, and as Bond, I don't really think that Daniel Craig works, but as an actor, he does a great job. This is the least Bond Bond film I have ever seen, so I rather liked it.",positive
Hands down my favorite Bond movie. The writing so much better and Daniel Craig is fantastic.,positive
"I normally hate James Bond movies, but this one is great! It's exciting, romantic, not too full with action (like normal Bond movies) and it has a surprising ending. Daniel Craig is without a doubt the best James Bond EVER!!!",positive
This is the only bond film i have seen and the only one i would watch again and again.,positive
return to great form for Bond,positive
"After the camp of recent escapades, Bond is back to basics. Craig is awesome, helped by a cracking script and a classy David Arnold soundtrack.",positive
"Enjoyed the movie and acting by Daniel Craig, but am not too sure about Eva Green. She looked like a soap opera actress... maybe it's only me. Wish Gwyneth Paltrow or someone more believabe had played the role.",positive
It's as good as Die Another Day was bad. THAT great.,positive
This is the best James bond movie.,positive
"The best Bond movie I've ever seen and I've seen most of them - Daniel Craig is awesome (plus he spends an awful lot of the movie either with no shirt on or with a very tight, wet shirt on...)",positive
"Parmi les trois meilleurs James Bond avec Goldfinger et Thunderball. Croyez moi, c'est un expert qui parle ;)",positive
Real Bond is back!!!,positive
"Just great. Couldn't expect a Bond movie this good. Thank you, especially Daniel!",positive
"Some of the best action scenes ever, including the amazing gorilla man... best Bond movie ever",positive
"Great story, awesome action and Daniel Craig - WOOF!",positive
good bond film for a change,positive
Daniel Craig makes a decent enough bond. Still it's toted as the best of the bunch by some. I don't see why it was just him sitting a table playing cards for half of it I guess if you like poker it's for you. I prefer Bond playing the simpler games like Baccarat or Blackjack since they take up far far less time,negative
great movie! He's a stud!!!!,positive
"Well I wasnt expecting to be impressed, however I was, somtimes its nice to be wrong.",positive
"Awesome movie, I have always been a James Bond fan and this just made me an even bigger fan. Daniel Craig fits the role perfectly.... A must see....",positive
he was an excellent james bond,positive
Loved it! Had all the cool spy gear! Judi Dench does a really good job again reprising her role.,positive
"This is simple... People didn't know how Craig would do as Bond...but he showed up and, in my opinion, he is the best Bond since Connery...I can't wait for more of the new 007",positive
By far the best James Bond. Certainly the best acting I've seen in a James Bond movie bar none.The last several Pierce Brosnan films were so pathetic I considered abandoning the series all together. They had no acting at all and barely any plot. Just cliche bad guys and lots of unrealistic special effects enabled stunts. This is Bond better than it ever was. Actual plot. Daniel Craig is fantastic in this film.,positive
to long for my taste more of a sit ay home in a comfy couch type of movie,negative
"I've never been a big Bond fan but this movie had me on the edge and kept my interest. It was great to not see stupid unrealistic gadgets or corny ""Bond"" lines. (Other than the last line in this film) lol but overall a great movie",positive
pretty damn good. i hated that they replaced the traditional card game of baccarat with texas hold'em.,positive
Hello Blonde Bond! He makes my life. This movie is amazing and again up there in my favourites of all time.,positive
"The most amazing movie ever!!!!!! Ah, Daniel Craig is amazing!",positive
Reimagining Bond successfully.,positive
One of the best James Bond movies! Daniel Craig was much better than i really expected!!,positive
"Best bond film since the days of connery, just brilliant",positive
"Bum-bom, bum-bom, berm-bom, bum-bom. Revived the franchise which had fallen so tragically into a chasm of tackiness. And I love a good ginge.",positive
i can honestly say the best james bond movie since goldfinger. about time he got out of the boring pierce brosman stage. daniel craig is the best bond yet,positive
"nearly the best bond ever, eva green steals the show..",positive
"nearly the best bond ever, eva green steals the show..",positive
"This was the first Bond movie I managed to sit through. Granted some of it was very cliche, but it was good.",positive
"Wow! I've been brought up on Bond, but this kicks ass big-style - eat your heart out Jack Bower! Perfect blend of British Bond and action, more raw and gritty, the way it should be. Craig rocks!",positive
"A cracking Bond adventure, especially considering the film it followed. After the disappointingly OTT Die Another Day, Royale brought the series firmly back down to Earth, and - more importantly - back to Ian Fleming's original character. This is no Bank Holiday romp - this is Bond as he is meant to be seen.",positive
"The most action-packed James Bond movie, and one of the best Bond films. The chase scene in the beginning was one of the best I've ever seen!",positive
"Aunque no vi el mero principio, estuvo entretenida",negative
"The James Bonds are always great but this one,with Russia with Love is the best out of all of them!",positive
Liked the fractals in the title sequence. Good film too.,positive
"nice to see it went a bit further than most of the bond films, adding some character-building elements, a slightly more complicated narrative & an intensity on the intuitive sense of the character over flashy gimmicks. reminded me of dr no. this film is just the tip of the iceberg of the way those films Should have gone....",positive
Amazing stunts and great scenes,positive
best bond 4 a long time,positive
"Saved the series, after the disaster of 'Die Another Day'",positive
One of my favorite Bond movies.,positive
Theres parkour here! :D,positive
"A good film, instead of a good Bond film. Craig superb. Best Bond film ever made hands down and a very fine action film.",positive
"What characterizes a James Bond movie? A mad genius villain? Super weapons? Spectacular high-tech spy equipment? Beautiful women? James doing impossible stunts, usually with an understated witty remark? Well, not this time: all of that is missing in Casino Royale. This James Bond more of an action hero than a secret agent, the girl isn't especially pretty, and the villain is just another terrorist (don't we have enough of those in the real world?) The plot revolves around a multi-million dollar game of Texas Hold 'em, so learn the game if you want to know what's going on.",negative
one of the best james bond movies defo,positive
"One of the best, if not the best Bond movie. Daniel Craig makes Pierce Brosnan look like a sissy. Ian Fleming would be proud.",positive
"Who would have thought? A blond Bond. Not as good as Connery, but comes in a close second.",positive
very good..(although daniel isnt a handsome guy),positive
"Quality movie with girls, guns, lines and a good plot. It keeps interesting after numeroud watches.",positive
"For the first time since God knows how many movies, I'm in love with James Bond. Wow, could this have been a more suprisingly incredible movie? Mental games, a Bond that can take a hit, that almost dies, that falls for the girl, that establishes the legacy? Daniel Craig, will you marry me?",positive
Possibly the best bond movie yet.,positive
thankfully they decided to start over and just get rid of all the old cliches that were really detracting from the last few bond films. daniel craig is easily the best bond since connery!,positive
Excellent start to the rebirth of this movie franchise.,positive
One of the best of the franchise!,positive
"Daniel Craig is wonderful as James Bond! He's hot, he can act and the back to absics approach worked. did i emntion that Daniel Craig is hot?!",positive
Bond the way he should be. Not too much focus on the girl ( ok at the end there was but it was all about the mission and the action!!!!),positive
Best car of Aston Martin DB7 I love car,positive
Not yet a true Bond film but a great action by any standards. The next one will inevitably be worth the wait.,positive
my favorite bond movie so far. daniel craig is a badass and he's terribly handsome.,negative
"I refused to accept a blonde Bond, but Craig was impressive.",positive
"Excellent. I wouldn't call it the best 007, but it's in the top three.",positive
not a James Bond fan at all but it was alright! Passed couple of hours quite easily and inoffensively!,negative
"While Sean Connery is my favorite Bond, Daniel Craig runs a close second. One of the best Bond films of them all.",positive
"Probably the best James Bond movie to date. Interestingly, it is also the James Bond movie that focuses more on the characters and less on Q's gadgets.",positive
the best of all the bond films so far,positive
"wicked good, i only give it 5 stars because i love bond movies",positive
my first james bond film and i loved it!!!,positive
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
lots of typical bond stuff. Not enough Gadgets. the bond is unprofessional too. but a good action flic.,negative
"a dramatic change from the ages of Golden eye and die another day. While you do not see such charecters as ""Q""'/""R"" you see a more down to earth Bond that is a lively revival from the classic novel",positive
firstly i thought that Craig was not a good choice for bond but after watchin the movie i feel that Craig has done the justice to the dark character of Bond in Casino Royale,positive
A great introduction of Craig in the Bond role. The poker scenes are very well done.,positive
I actually liked Daniel Craig as 007 a lot. This was a good one.,positive
"A good lean Bond - not closer to the books like some people who haven't read the books say - this one has a lean and haggard look - a good one for the early 2000s, when the game seems a grim one.",positive
"Excellent birth of a new James Bond. The only thing I don't like is the end. Very VERY dumb. If I could see that she was a traitor... why can't he... I mean... he's james bond. He's the one seducing the women on the other side... well, I hope in the next one he'll have his full IQ capacity",positive
I.Love. Bond. I own this dvd. Amazing new direction at a classic tragic character.,positive
"This is the first Bond film since Moonraker that I have enjoyed, and understood the plot of. Daniel Craig was fantastic, and I really felt for his character at the end, which is something that previous Bond movies wouldn't make me do.",positive
"The best ""james Bond"" of all the series...",positive
Best Bond movie to date.,positive
Daniel Craig is the best James Bond yet. I didn't fall asleep at all during this movie!,positive
the new version is better,positive
I was very skeptical about Daniel Craig being able to pull this role off. I am a huge James Bond fan (yes even the cheesy ones). This movie was amazing though. Hands down the best James Bond to date. Daniel Craig added so much depth to a seemingly shallow role and by the end of the movie in the final scene you finally saw the suave James Bond you know and love. This is an amazing prequel that adds so much depth to the entire James Bond series. I strongly recommend this one to any action/spy movie lover.,positive
One of the best bond films i have seen. I would go as far as saying he is the best bond since sean c,positive
I agree with ben more hard ass bond! best ive ever seen!,positive
"okay, not like the old bond",negative
Daniel Craig IS the new James Bond,positive
"Where the fuck are the gadgets??? WTF. It's Bond, without none of the dope shit.",negative
"I could go on forever about the continuity. It's the first bond, and M is older... and the cars are newer... instead of older... and there is no plot. Besides gambling. Then it ends... hmmm.",negative
Uudemmista Bondeista paras. Roger Moore on kuitenkin se vanhoista paras! Totisempaa Bondia.,positive
i love the sarcasm and the witty dialogues even more than the action!!! a complete entertainer right from the first frame to the last!! probably the first bod who makes it look like all the stunts can be done!!!,positive
In my top 5...truly amazing.,positive
"With the exception of the overly long 'end sequence' this was certainly a well played bond, however far from the best.",positive
"Thank god they diverted from the same old formula they have been using since the franchise began. Much better than any other Bond film before it, especially the last three.",positive
"One of the most intriguing Bond films yet; there are some things that strike me as very wrong here (strange pace, clunky dialogue, well-done-but-average action), but in the end? Oh so right.",positive
"A great addition to the Bond series, but not enough suave sophisticated Bond so much as, I'm going to chase you down and rip your face off Bond.",positive
Raw power in the hands of Daniel Craig. Can't publish what I was dreaming about him.... Sigh....,positive
"After being unsure of the future of Bond, I was very pleased with Casino Royale. It proved any worries to be completely unnecessary. Daniel Craig was a great Bond, pulling off very hard and gritty moments and also the softer charming moments we all love. Can't wait to see his second outing as I love the Bond series.",positive
"Not the Bond we've come to know and sometimes enjoy, but I found this one to be a pretty good action movie.",negative
"Interesante, el desarrollo fue flojo y el final fue muy crudo.",negative
"amazing, one of my favorites",positive
"A radical change in the series. It's a joy to finally see Bond take on a real personality, impulsive and sadistic.",positive
I hope new Bond movies are like this. Freakin' sweet,positive
"A fantastic Bond film, very different from the rest. I did not really look at it as a Bond film, however, due to its many diversions from formula.",positive
this movie was ok decent action,negative
"Everything a Bond film should have been, and then even better.",positive
the new bond did a great job,positive
Hats off to Daniel Craig.,positive
I'd venture to say this is the best Bond movie.,positive
"The only Bond movie I have watched all the way through.I loved the action,the story,the cheesyness of the love story.I was glued to it,and Daniel Craig was so hot!!",positive
"Loved it -- great action, less gimmicks, more character development. Great reset of the franchise. Can't wait for 22.",positive
They nuke Bond's balls,positive
craig est incroyable en Bond. intense en simonac et c'est pas peu dire.,positive
fwar!!! daniel craig!,positive
I enjoyed this one. The Brit is hot. The only part that made me squeemish was the ball torture part...that was just too much. Im still in pain thinking about it.,positive
best movie ever....xxx,positive
"I love Daniel Craig as 007. Surely he's the best one since Sean Connery. This Bond is realistic and he hurts. The directing and editing are incredible. The story is interesting and features a great love story. As with all Bond movies, the music cuts in with perfection. See it!",positive
great movie the best bond film to date,positive
Having read several of the Bond novels I can honestly say that this was the most accurate portrayal of James Bond yet. Daniel Craig gave an amazing performance and looked the part as well. Hands down my favorite Bond film. Definitely helped me forget about the terrible Die Another Day.,positive
"Perfect in nearly every way, could very well be the best James Bond yet, Daniel Craig does an excellent job as Bond",positive
Great addition to the James Bond series. Daniel Craig did a great job!,positive
"Overrated but entertaining. Craig is a Jason Boure-esque Bond, and te story is more serious and dark than previous Bond pictures.",negative
Although the timeline is all to cock and this doesn 't feel like a Bond classic its still a decent film Mr Craig is a fine actor so i'm looking forward to his next attemt at 007,positive
Still can't beat Connery!,negative
I thought the new bond is fucking great.,positive
"007 movies are usually interesting, the plot in this one wasn't as interesting as the final twist. so, yeah, good overall.",negative
"Fantastic movie. I hated Prick Bronsan, but now that he is out of the way, and Daniel Craig has taken over, I am eagerly awaiting the newest installment.",positive
"Many say.. ahh go back to the old ones... they are much better, but this one surprised me alot...",positive
I loved it daniel Craig was the first blonde bond but it worked for me. Kept me gripped to my seat wish I had seen it at the cinema.,negative
"Now this is how Ian Fleming imagined his creation, James Bond. Ruthless and determined yet cool and confident, this is a Bond that depends on his own skill and wits, not gadgets and fancy cars. And that is why it worked.",positive
"The best Bond of them all. Everything about this film beats the rest, from the opening credits, to the more intelligently designed plot, the scenery, acting, dialogue, everything. Daniel Craig does the most accurate Bond portrayal yet.",positive
first time ever i thought bond was hubba hubba hotness!,negative
better than pierce brosnan,negative
everyone said that Goldeneye was the best bond flick and i agreed but after i scene this one iunno there pretty tight,negative
"bond is back and playing poker, cant get much better",positive
The most realistic bond movie ever,positive
"An excellent relaunch of the Bond franchise. Daniel Craig is the only physically intimidating Bond to grace the screen, with pure intensity in his character.",positive
The best Bond ever. Daniel Craig is fantastic.,negative
Emphasis on character development instead of SFX is a welcome change.,positive
"gotta love james bond, this is an instant classic.",positive
"This movie rox it has action, humor and hotness!",positive
Bond Begins? More realistic storyline and more character development than any other Bond movie works for me.,positive
"gile....dari semua pelem 007 yg pernah gue tonton dari jamanny Sean Connery smp yg paling anyar si Daniel Craig, pelem ini yang bikin gua nonton berxx..apalagi ada si cantik Eva Green..hmm....",positive
Probably the best 007 movie. The thuggish psychotic emotional detachment of a trained killer with a short life expectancy come across here. People die quickly and professionally and the gadgets are sensible. The plot is ridiculous but I liked the idea of the bond girl being a bean counter to make sure that not too much tax payers money is spent.,positive
best James bond movie!!,positive
Daniel Craig -um- falling out of the bottom of a chair -that was worth the admission price alone.,positive
"an awesome movie...Bond when he just started,reckless but he was awesome..but i'd have to say that die another is a bit better",positive
My favorite James Bond.,positive
Not as good as brosnan,positive
daniel craig in swimmimg trunks!!!,positive
"Craig is a badass Bond, but the film as a whole feels a little dragged out",negative
"On a level with Tomorrow Never Dies and The Spy Who Loved Me. I was among those prepared to blame Daniel Craig for not being Clive Owen, but Craig is Bond.",positive
cause I love all james Bond films,positive
"Great 007 Movie, May Need To Start Watching The Franchise Again After Seeing Bond's First Mission. Need To Hit The Gym Hard After Seeing This Movie (You Know What I Mean!)",positive
only bond movie showed in China.......,positive
Great Movie. Definately one of the best Bond Movies. Actor Daniel Craig does a great job of portraying a more kick-ass Bond.,positive
"daniel craig is ok, but i prefer pierce brosnan, he was the best bond ever!! but still 5 stars from me!",positive
"Great action movie. But a great BOND movie? Hard to say, because it didn't feel like a Bond at all. This one still has me a bit confused...I enjoyed it a lot, but I can't help but feel nostalgic for some of the forgone traditions.",positive
"One word can describe this film: Excellent! This IS what a Bond film should be: Thrilling. ""Casino Royale"" delivers all the goods, without the gadgets. No gadgets? Yep, that's right, NO gadgets. Maybe a few ""enhanced"" tools. But that's it. This is a gritty, thrilling Bond flick for the new ages. Okay, we start off with Bond (Daniel Craig) earning his ""00"" status. (Love the black-and-white effect.) After that he goes to Madagascar where he ends up killing an important lead. But not before doing an excellently staged parkour chase across the city. Killing the lead puts him against his boss, M (Judi Dench), who's frustrated because they wanted to question the man, and not kill him. Bond later travels to the Bahamas, where he eventually ruins one of Le Chiffre's (Mads Mikkelsen) plans. Leaving Le Chiffre bankrupt. Le Chiffre stressfully stages a high-stakes poker game at ""Casino Royale"" in Montenegro, to win the money back. Bond is sent to be in the poker tournament. On his way, he meets an official from HM Treasury, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), who he later falls in love with. The plot for the movie is bullet-proof. (By that, I mean no bullets go through putting ""plot holes."") Daniel Craig is a great James Bond: Tough, agile, and can actually be hurt (physically and mentally). He's fantastic! Craig sits on the Bond throne without adjusting the seat. He fits in. He's not Connery, or Moore, but he's his own Bond. That's what makes him great. He doesn't try to re-create previous Bonds, but, rather, makes his own. Bravo, Mr. Craig! Also, Martin Campbell should take a slice of the cake for his brilliant directing! As well as the actors. They're all flawless. Eva Green, Judi Dench, Mads Mikkelsen, Jeffery Wright (did you think I'd forget him?), everyone! This can rank as the best Bond film in years, if not, the best! My score: 10/10 My RT score: 100/100",positive
Could have been shorter(by condensing the SLOW parts) but overall a good movie.,negative
Probably one of my favorite bond films of all time. The execution of this story is perfect and Daniel Craig is one of the best bonds that I have seen.,positive
"One word - amazing! Arguably the best Bond film I have ever seen. Daniel Craig brings Bond back to his roots - reminiscent of Fleming's original harsh, cold-hearted secret agent, the humour that has often been associated with the character is now all gone. People hail Connery as the best Bond, and it is true no one else has come even close to Connery's portrayal - until now.",positive
This movie is soo Good! And Daniel Craig is HOT in this!,positive

"best bond since a long, long time... due to the fact that Brosman sucked as 007",positive
"Craig and Dench are brill, the rest average!",positive
one of the best Bond movies' ever,positive
i actually had a blast watchin' this.,positive
One of the best Bond Movie with On Her Majesty's Secret Service! A new beginning for a new Bond!,positive
"(farting noise) ""I'm making farting noises with my mouth,"" (farting noise).",negative
"Excellent, if a bit over long. Craig is very good.",positive
"Thank you for a new, most excellent, Bond.",positive
I have seen all of the Bond movies. I would have to say that Casino Royale with Daniel Craig as 007 is the best of the movies.,positive
"""a little more to the left"" it hurt to watch",positive
"that first scene... so great! First I saw of ""parkour"" in film.",positive
"An Actor's biggest challenge - being a better Bond than the previous if offered the chance. Craig came, he saw, he was not found wanting. They set out to take bond to his roots and they did just that, but gave us flair and sex appeal too - brilliant Sunday movie whatever the weather",positive
The series gets back on track. Daniel Craig owns this role.,positive
This is actually a funny movie. A revolutionary image of Bond being out of control and away from the type of classic aura.,negative
Daniel Craig is awesome.,positive
"I thought it kicked the crap out of all of Brosnan's Bond movies with the possible exception of Goldeneye. This could be because Fleming actually wrote both stories, but Craig gives a life and playfullness to the character not seen since Connery. Looking forward to the next installment!",positive
"as close to the books as they will ever get , welcome back Sean i mean James",positive
"never into in bond's movie but this one i like, daniel craig is so cool",positive
Daniel Craig is a badass. best Bond since Sean Connery. the movie was very well done and developed the characters nicely.,positive
"Much better action than the other bond movies. Nothing out of this world, just good old bad guys who need someone to put his foot up their ass.",positive
One of my most favorite movies in years. I love that bond is back to his roots and isn't corny anymore.,positive
"I really enjoyed this movie, I believe Daniel Craig is what the Bond Universe needed to help us into the next decade of Action/Bond films. I am curious to see how he keeps it up.",positive
It wasn't even a Bond movie... plus Daniel Craig is preeety ugly.,negative
"Best ""Bond"" in a while.",positive
"I have such a crush on Judi Dench in this movie. Oh, who am I kidding? I always have a crush on Judi Dench.",positive
"Classy, clever, and action-packed. What Bond is supposed to be. None of that cartoony evil villain crap.",positive
"No ""Q"", no gadgets, no shooting, no humor. Just a game of poker. LAME!!! The first 10 minutes are the best part, after that shut it off. Give me the high-tech Brosnen stuff over this James ""Blond"" any day. Or better yet bring back Connery for one last blast.",negative
"your average james bond movie: shooting, chases, money, and a chick in the end.",negative

The 1st neo-Bond I really enjoyed. All splash and entertainment.,negative
quite enjoyed the new Bond...,negative
"Craig is an amazing Bond, great way to tell the story of how Bond became 007.",positive
I really like the ation and pace of the film,negative
right behind GOldeneye for favorite bond movie,positive
I've got a little itch...,positive
Bond is back with a vengence,positive
Wasn't as good as some of the other bonds but was still pretty good. I don't really like Daniel Craig as Bond.,positive
"i didn't think anyone would be able to make me waver in my long-standing devotion to sean connery, but daniel craig is the new leading bond man in my life. so good, so much more to it than most bond movies.",positive
"After the stinking monstrosity of Die Another Day, surely the only direction for the Bond franchise was up (but then you would have thought that after the crap-o-rama of The World is Not Enough). Mercifully, Casino Royale does show signs of improvement but that is more a reflection of the woeful depths the series had sunk to than any great cause for celebration. Daniel Craig makes a muscular, charismatic Bond but the film's scenario seems incredibly tired with the drama struggling to rise above a so-what level of interest. And while the Monte Carlo and Caribbean settings would have once seemed the height of stylish affluence, these days they merely epitomise a cruddy nouveaux-riche naffness that will only appeal to people who read magazine articles with titles like 'How to Live Like the Beckhams for Â£1.99'. Returning 007 helmer Martin Campbell (Goldeneye) handles the action in competent fashion but, aside from an early chase across a building site, none of it ever really threaten to take the breath away. Eva Green as the love interest fills out an evening dress in eye-catching fashion but appears to be significantly younger than her leading man. Any scenes where Craig is called upon to flirt with her results in him coming across rather like a sleazy uncle while the love scenes between the two threaten to raise the spectre of such previous Bond May to December romantic mismatches as Roger Moore and Grace Jones (okay, they're not that bad). The title song is absolutely bloody horrible for what seems like the eight-hundredth time in a row and a certain make of laptop was featured so heavily I was surprised it didn't crop up in the cast list in the closing credits.",negative
mmmm... Daniel Craig... what else do you need to know??,positive
"A lot of character development -- movie gold for me. I was kind of confused about Vesper's motives (which is all I can say about that, so as to not tip off people who haven't seen it, but I'm probably one of the last people to see it for the first time). Goldeneye is still my favorite out of sentimental value and love for Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, but this one is pretty good.",negative
"action, suspense, beautifully shot, a guy film through and through, good storyline, near perfect for me",positive
"Nice to see Bond updated.. ironic being base on the first novel however. Edgy, fun & awesome action - Daniel Craig best Bond since Connery",positive
"The most realistic Bond yet! Gets ass kicked way more than usual --Craig fits the bill on this one. Not a huge fan of the excesive amount of poker playing, but that was how it was in the book! Hope the next Bonds' follow ""suit""?",positive
Ranks among the top tier bond films,negative
Fabulous. Enough said.,positive
The best Bond movie. A great portrait of James Bond's early darkest days.,positive
ian craig is the second best bond behind connery.,positive
"The best Bond movie in a long, long while. Daniel Craig's Bond is gritty, violent, and intelligent; he doesn't need the gadgets to beat the bad guys. He's emotionally conflicted, which makes him more human, and more deadly. Favorite Bond movie.",positive
Good reinvention of the franchise.. some inconsistencies but a solid Bond movie with a wee too much poker.,positive
"What a disappointment! Give Pierce Brosnan back the role. Too gritty for my tastes and didn't feel like Bond at all, just some hired assasin. I didn't care for the storyline either. Daniel Craig will never be JB to me, I just really don't like him.",negative
"I usually do not like James Bond movies, but this was one was incredibly different. Daniel Craig is awesome.",positive
Best James Bond movie ever made. Daniel Craig is amazing. Done.,positive
"Very awesome, very dark, just sweet.",positive
i thought it got too boring in the middle.,negative
"eh...I don't like the new James Bond, and one of the lines with the new ""bond girl"" could have come straight out of a cheesy drug store romance novel...",negative
"i thought it was shit, everybody else loved it. i say they're dumb.",negative
Bond...at his best. Brings Connery's no BS attitude back,positive
Such a kick-ass Bond. Love Daniel Craig.,positive
First 10 minutes was worth the 9 bucks,negative
"I love Bond movies although many of them are very cheesy. I honestly believe this is the greatest Bond movie ever. I love the fact that the Bond character was taken seriously and we get to see a more gritty realistic Bond that kicks ass. Great action believable story and a cool Bond (Daniel Craig is the perfect Bond, even better than, dare I say, Sean Connery).",positive
Didn't fit in with the other films. Sean Connery needs to come back one last time.,negative
"So I wasn't sure if Craig could pull Bond off but he definitely exceeding my expectations, bringing something new to Bond. As for the storyline, once you admit that it can only happen in a Bond film, you enjoy it that much more.",positive
"Meat Head James Bond doesn't work that well for me, eva green does though",positive
"what a good bond craig the local makes, a bit cheesy but not as cheesy as the others?",positive
"in my opinion, the best Bond movie to date",positive
"This is the best incarnation of the character on-screen; he acts like an assassin , rather than an intelligence officer (""secret agent"") that people believe him to be.",positive
honestly my favorite bond...a whole new dimension of one of my fave heroes. wonderful story and extremely entertaining action.,positive
"Finally, a real James Bond. Daniel Craig is amazing.",positive
I thought Bond had balls in this film. Good action.,negative
The blonde Bond is the Best,positive
"TrÃ¨s bon film qui tient en haleine, Daniel Craig est excellent et ne jure pas dans ce rÃ´le avec les prÃ©cedents 007.",positive
"Daniel Craig is a revelation as Bond. And a dark intriguing chapter in Bond's life, nothing campy here.",positive

Love to play poker ?,positive
Good Bond film but not the best. This was just a great action film with the Bond name.,positive
Better than most Bond movies. Lots of eye candy.,positive
Bond remodelled into a much rugged and hard hitting than ever before. Superb.,positive
bringing back a respectable bond,positive
daniel craig was good in this and was worth watching as im not a james bond fan,positive
...scarier bond... unanswered questions... and so we wait for the next part of the story...,positive
How Bond should be! A real person with feelings...Daniel Craig...what can I say?,positive
"Though a betrayal to the Bond franchise, audiences will wonder why ""Casino Royale's"" dubious authority and moral uncertainty rings true.",positive
this is what i called the real james bond. n i jus loooove daniel craig!! the bluest eyes I've ever seen! i jus fell in love w/ him (his eyes!),positive
great flick until the bloated 20 min love story section near the end of the movie. monkey man made a good bond despite his licence to kill dalton haircut.,negative
"A nice fresh, and true to the nature of Bond film. I enjoyed this, though had the entire film been black and white such as in the opening perhaps I could have liked it more.",positive
Bond er tilbage! Hil Daniel Craig! Godt at se en skuespiller spille James Bond med en rÃ¥hed og selvfÃ¸lgelighed som ikke er set siden Sean Connerys tid som 007.,positive
"It looked pretty, but I was bored. I'm more of a ""Goldeneye"" type guy.",negative
Wow. I like James Bond?,positive
"umm i donno about him being more 'real' cuz real people do not jump building to building like that, nor do we walk off stab wounds and such, nonetheless, extremely entertaining, and really a great romantic tragedy",positive
"Solid actioner caries a little more to it than most of it's kind. Ultimately I found the last half to lack the excietment that the first half built so strongly. Still, it's definately worth watching.",positive
"I didn't know if I was going to like him, but I do.",positive
it was not bad. makes james bond look more human and not all hero. it had some slow parts but watching daniel craig made it all worth it,negative
The movie that made me hot for Daniel Craig.,positive
My Favorite James Bond,positive
great adaption of the book and a great bond movie much like the ones with Sean Connery,positive
"This film is the best bond yet, filled with high octave action, wit, and charm. Casino Royale is the quintessential Bond film that balances glamor/ grandeur with a more realistic, dark modern reality. Much of the movie is carried by Daniel Craig, whose portrayal of 007 deserves high recognition, combining the darkness of Timothy Dalton, some of Brosnan's charm, and Lazenby's vulnerability, Craig crafts James Bond not just as a ruthless assassin, but discards the facade of the lifeless agent, embracing Bond as a human with tender emotions.",positive
Best James Bond Ever!,negative
"Bond fan here, but this is a Bond in name only. Can you possibly imagine this ""early"" Bond ever evolving into a 007 played by Connery, Moore or, God forbid, Dalton? Shudder. Craig takes Bond to a new level and adds the kind of depth that resurrects a franchise. Lucky for Broccoli, Bond was never in trouble, and now they have the most powerful movie brand to leverage in the world.",positive
"Holy cow! Daniel Craig has the bluest eyes. He's so cute and he's an amazing actor, must not forget that. Casino Royal is amazing. I've always loved Bond movies and this was fabuolous. One of the best.",positive
Bloody brilliant Bond! Craig is awesome and while i missed some classic 'Bond' things - this was a great re-invention.,positive
"I must admit, I was hesitant when I heard Daniel Craig was going to be the new James Bond. Well...he put all my worries to rest. One of the best, if not the best, opening 20 mins of any Bond film. Daniel Craig isn't the Bond we're used to but he delivers in his new way.",positive
"really pretty good. i didn't think i was going to like it, but it was good...",positive
Revival of a dying franchise. Daniel Craig is the best Bond.,positive
It's not so hard to watch Bond. This film was worth the time it took to watch it.,positive
"Appaling and boring. Im Devistated, While Daniel Craig is playin g bond I will never go and see another one. From a huge bond fan, It made me feel dead inside. Im betrayed!",negative
it turned out to be better than i thought. however daniel craig isnt even close to pierce bronson. bronson is the best bond ever!,positive
Different Bond same over the top action. I thought it was good but not great,negative
The best Bond-movie this far. The only thing that could've given it the full five stars would've been Connery. He will always remain my #1 Bond.,positive
"Casino Royale has brought Bonds into the modern era with a bang, all the usual extravagant locations, explosions and hot women, but just for a change it has a realistic bond without masses of cheesy gadgets. Problem is I can't help but feel its stolen a lot from the Bournes. Still world class and the best Bond ever. Daniel Craig for prime minister.",positive
"the best bond film (although not book) there currently is (and yes....i grew up watching ALL the bond films). from the very first scene, till the last watery grave for that (the only bad thing i've got to say about this movie) annoying posh ponce vespa. loved it. and it's got daniel craig in a pair of tight blue shorts.....what more could you want????",positive
strayed away from traditional bond,negative
The first Bond move that I liked...,positive
"Daniel Craig was much better than i anticipated, but he's no Bond though. I liked some moves he performed and the chase scene in the beginning, but that was really it- i mean it was really just an (i would like to say below, but almost all action these days is below everything) average action movie.",negative
Great movie...little slow in the Casino scenes...,positive
"Daniel Craig is not better than Connery, but I liked him better than Moore.",negative
"i dont really like Daniel Craig, also the fuckin' FORD that appears in the movie but I can forget all that just because its a Bond movie",negative
Compared to the last couple of bond movies this was good. However for an action movie it was slow. Judi Dench made me cringe with her unbelievable portrayal as the head of MI6 and Eva Green must be the ugliest Bond women in the whole franchis. Overall the movie could probally be fixed by slashing about an hour of slow script from it.,negative
awesome need i say more,positive
"pretty good, lots of action",negative
Bond is back doing what Bond should be doing. None of that crazy shit. Just old fashioned espoinage.,positive
this is very amazing and excellent movie :D i like it.,positive
le film le plus stylÃ© du monde,positive
Daniel Craig - so hot! Most believable James Bond ever.,positive
Great new bond actor!,positive
"Doesn't come close to the other bond classics. They decided to cast the new Bond as a jerk now? Crashing the Aston-Martin was...neat?...but other than that, not much car action.",negative
"Easily my favourite 007 movie and Bond. Had doubts about Daniel being cast, but he blew me away. The guy can act and he is easily believable as a spy with an edge. Almost forgot who the other bonds were (with apologies to Connery who now comes as the second best). Same director as Goldeneye, but different look and style, thanks to the script enhancements and producers wanting to relaunch Bond with more tuned to current times. Oh yeah, less CGI and Gismos and old fashioned stunts! Worth watching just for the early running chase on top the crane and through the construction site! Bond is Back!!!",positive
"Other than the first action scene, where Bond is running through the construction site, there is no real excitement here. FX took over and made good acting a thing of the past...",negative
"No Pierce Brosnan, but great fight and action scenes.",positive
Average four stars? What's wrong with you people?,negative
"I don't like James Bond movies, but I liked this one a lot. The action scenes were incredible, the chase scenes spectacular; it's the first poker playing scene I found interesting, and oh, did I mention that Daniel Craig is the hottest Bond EVER?",negative
trop bien comme film,positive
"Not bad as a Bond film, but still a major disappointment.",negative
"on préfèrera la version avec Woody Allen, Peter Sellars etc...",negative
"Casino Royale confirmed the end of Bond saga. When someone removes every trace of a person, that person cease to exist. Casino Royale was the movie in which the vilain became hero. The gentleman was replaced by an ass hole. The beautifull bond girl was replaced by a (only) cute intelectual lady. So, game over. Just another action movie.",negative
"This was 007's first 00 mission, and it was a fantastic mission at that. I'll admit that I was most excited about watching the movie and it didn't disappoint in terms of the mission (even though M was still the woman from the later Bond films). After the mission, I was just disappointed with the fact that Bond fell for the woman and allowed himself to be duped the way that he was. I know that it explains more as to what happens in later missions with Bond's attitude, but really, it was just so un-Bond I took objection.",positive

"A couple of years ago, around the time 'Tomorrow Never Dies' came out, I went on a mission to see as many of the James Bond Films as I could. I saw damn near all of them and then came to a horrible conclusion. I don't really like James Bond films. The one that stood out as 'the best' was 'You Only Live Twice', but even that wasn't fantastic. I saw 'Tomorrow Never Dies' and it was pretty awful and over the following years they didn't get much better. I did like Pierce Brosnan in the role, and 'Goldeneye' is one of the better ones, but none of the films really did it for me. I think the whole problem for me was that the James Bond films promised so much, but delivered so little. So we come to the 2006 version of 'Casino Royale'. I didn't think Brosnan was quite done with Bond, but seeing what they did with this film, I can see why they wanted a change. I hadn't seen Daniel Craig in very much, I wasn't particularly impressed with either 'Layer Cake' or 'Munich', so I didn't hold much hope that he'd improve the character. The director is Martin Campbell, with his second attempt at the Bond franchise (the first was 'Goldeneye'), and I don't really like any of his films either, I don't mind the Zorro films. My expectations are low, but when I come to see it, I'm quite impressed. Craig plays Bond more as a real person rather than the caricatures of spies and playboys portrayed in the past. You can believe he is an assassin working for the british govenment. The action scenes are fantastic, what I always expected a James Bond action scene to look like. Though there is one chase scene early on in the film which would probably look more in place in a 'Men in Black' or 'X-Men' film. All in all, it was great. I'd say the best Bond film to date.",negative
"close to connery, but closest to the books out of the bond films yet.",positive
"Why are you still reading this, watch it now. Daniel Craig is amazing and Eva Green is a fox.",positive
"This is what an action movie should be. There was more action in the first 20 minutes than in most others. The plot was not spectacular but it was pretty good, especially at adapting modern technology into it. Give it a go if you are looking for a good action movie with a plot.",positive
"Daniel Craig may be the best Bond yet ... he is not only HOT, he is believable, stylish, gritty, real ... none of that airbrushed, sanitized hollywood fluff ...",positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond. If you think another is better watch another Craig's performance back to back with the opposing Bond. There really is no comparison.,positive
"Love Daniel Craig. I honestly couldn't care less whether Bond was blonde or brunette. I was pleased that the movie focused on the plat rather than special effects, and now Bond is back the way he's supposed to be.",positive
"This movie came with high expectations which were well met by Craig, as well as superb visual, action, special effects, and seeing bond without his gadgets gave him a more human feel. The movie had a great pace and good plot, especially the intense poker sequence.",positive
My second favorite James Bond. Daniel Craig plays the part perfectly.,positive
"i know its been out a while, and i've seen probably ten times, but i just felt like reviewing it. easily in the top five bond movies, and that's coming from a die hard bond fan. daniel craig is an awesome bond, great story, need i say more.",positive
"I am a Bond film fan. I love them all: from the classic Connery films of the 60s, to the cheese of Moore's movies in the 70s and overly gadgetized Brosnan flicks in the 90s. Except Lazenby. He was horrible. Anyway, I had low expectations with Craig as the new Bond. He, and this film, are tremendous. Going back to basics, there are no missile launchers in trench coats or laser beam firing toothbrushes. Just a Walther P99 and good ol' hand2hand ass kicking. Also, it's possible this movie has one of the best foot chases ever put to film; that bomber guy is like Spiderman or something. The bad guy is really great, a Bond girl like the one next door and a plot that's credible.",positive
"This movie sucks. Its boring, I don't care who the hell these people are, and the entire time i found myself fantasizing about stabbing myself with a fork to make sure my nerves hadn't rotted away. This is the most boring Bond movie ever made.",negative
"Best bond movie yet. I know bond purists will disagree, but that's what i think",positive
surprisingly excellent. best bond film in many years,positive
"LOVE IT. I expected to HATE this bond, but I fell madly in love with him. Great action, great story. Can't believe they managed to make watching a poker game that interesting. LOVED Vesper too. Nice bond girl!!",positive
One of the best recent Bond movies. Craig is surprisingly good in the role of 007,positive
Best Bond Film Ever!!!!!,positive
Change is sometimes a good thing.,positive
"this was to b the initial bond, and very rough no finesse, yes u cant b suave on yo first day",negative
The best Bond movie in years. I have no problem with Daniel Craig - but I like them all.,positive
Who couldn't love it?,negative
"Terriable, I had alot of expectation for this movie and it failed me, in my opinion this is the wrost james bond flim that I have seen",negative
I loved it. Daniel Craig definetly makes a great Bond. The movie was very entertaining and not as goofy as the last few 007 installments.,positive
I loved this movie. From the gritty fight scenes to the sad ending.,positive
Watched it with Esther and Josh and had a blast! I just bought my own copy last night.,positive
daniel craig was a good bond! didn't c dat coming,positive
I wasn't completely sold on Daniel Craig... at least until I saw the movie. He may end up being a greater Bond than Connery. He's already #2 in franchise history. And the movie went away from the glitzy junk that screwed up every film since GoldenEye.,positive
"""and the valet ticket, pls"" Love it.",positive
I thought it was a fresh start,positive
"The James Bond equivalent of the Dark Knight Returns, a more hard edged Bond minus the camp stylings of his predecessor, gone are the over the top ridiculously impossible stunts, Bond exsists now on a plain where the laws of gravity apply. This is indicated most in the opening sequence, gone is the plane surfing exploits, replaced by a gritty chase scene through a building site, ending with the pursuee getting shot in a daring escape attempt by Bond from an embassy. The standards remain, i.e. the lovable rogue that all women desire and his ability to be seemingly bullet proof, running past multiple assailants firing upon him with machine guns to no avail. There are some very good plot points and character developments. The natural evolution of Bond is here and masterfully portrayed by Daniel Craig, welcome to the reborn generation of superspy.",positive
This was exactly like the novel and I loved that. The only thing I didn't like was that there was no Q :(,negative
"not enough action scenes and explosions, but still pretty good",positive
not the best james bond but a ace movie!,positive
Changed my review after the second viewing from 3.5 to 4.5. This film is a lot better than I originally gave it credit for. Makes the Brosnan Bond's look the same way The Dark Knight makes Batman and Robin look.,positive
"A better way to go for Bond movies. Some people won't agree with that, but Craig doesn't seem like the Bonds that we've gotten comfortable with. You know what I'm talking about. The ones that are never in any danger of compromising their cool or losing anything. Or the ones that are never dark.",positive
"Took the wife with me for this one and she hates bond films ,came away wanting to go cheetham hill and buy the pirate copy ha ha",positive
"Daniel Craig is the man. Anyone that says he isn't the best bond is an idiot. I've seen this movie at least 20 times, and I would still watch it at any time. I love it.",positive
Watch this film. Bond fan or not.,positive
"This is not James Bond. This is simply awful. He doesn't do anything that Bond does! The beginninng is awesome, yes, but after that first action scene it's awful. The villain is an INVESTOR (oh boy!), Bond doesn't shoot anyone, he drives for literally 15 seconds, and all he does is play cards. Worst Bond movie I've ever seen.",negative
"Really cool, loved it..........",positive
"i usually don't like movies like this... but i must admit, it was AWESOME! I was actually suprised by how much I liked the movie and how much I got into it!",positive
its only a good movie if you can follow... cause if u loose track you wont understand a thing. But still its one of the best bonds since Sean Connery. 2 thumbs up,negative
Daniel Craig is my favorite bond out of all of them.,positive
"Top class stuff. Tells you the roots as to why Bond is how he is. Great characters, top comic villains and some great plot moments. I was never much a Bond fan, but this got me into the idea of rewatching all the classic Bond movies.",positive
Great action sequences and no cheesy gags. Impressive.,positive
"This is probably the best Bond film, although I wouldn't consider myself a Bond fan. They finally managed to update 007 for the post-cold war age. The action sequences were so much fun, as was the poker game. Daniel Craig's Bond is a slightly more complex character here who actually falls in love with the beautiful Eva Green. Casino Royale has everything a Bond film should have: exotic locales, incomprehensible plotting, great one-liners, and badass chase scenes. I can't wait for the next one.",positive
i absolutly love james bond.,positive
"La unica pelicula de James Bond que merece la pena. (Los tiene de titanio, por otra parte).",negative
U Cant Define An Action Movie If u Havnt Seen THis One!,positive
Really good Bond movie. Daniel Craig is the most believable agent after Sir Sean Connery.,positive
Really good James Bond! A realy different style that totally seduced me! Unless it was the hot Daniel Craig :-),positive
"Tout arrive, meme m'interresser a James Bond :-)",positive
"I had to watch this while donating plasma. It was entertaining enough, although not my style.",negative
one of the best bond films,positive
My first Bond movie. Way better then I was expecting. The action scenes felt very realistic. Good movie.,positive
"So effing good. Even my wife loved it, and she is not into Bond!",positive
Who's Pierce Brosnan?,positive
"Brilliant, rates about a 4.5 on the Claytometer! Mads Mikkelsen is fantastic as always.",positive
"terrible. quite possibly the WORST bond movie ever. craig cannot be a bond. terrible plot. slow moving, since it revolves around a card game, which is slow.",negative
"it's official: i don't like daniel craig. nothing personal, i just frown when i see his face.",negative
Kicks all kinds of ass.,positive
"I was never a huge Bond fan - I liked playing Bond because his guns and gadgets and everything were fun, but I also liked playing Mission Impossible (and we all know how those movies turned out.) But after seeing this movie, I fell in love with Bond, just, you know, not in a gay way. Very fun, very entertaining, just a thrill ride from beginning to end and it just leaves you wanting more. Can't wait for Bond 22. Daniel Craig owns the Bond role now, as far as I'm concerned.",positive
i'm a huge 007 fan and this one was great. darker but great,positive
Another very good bond,positive
Great action and story.,positive
"One of the best Bond films for a long time, Daniel Craig is brilliant! Looking forward to the sequel...",positive
Bond Back And Its great !,positive
except for that boring part towards the end ... this was an amazing bond.,positive
"this is one of my favourite bond films ever its just amazing. but i just thought, this means i have to go through every bond film now *he cries*...........",positive
"Brilliant action movie, even if I am not fond of Daniel Craig acting skills...",negative
"I fell in love with Mr. Bond when I watched the Pierce Brosnan version of Goldeneye... ...But now, 007 on acid (Daniel Craig as Bond) has my love loool! Okay in lamens, Best bond I ever seen!",positive
"Best Bond film by far, Danial Craig brings a different dimension to the character, who needs gadgets when you can kick ass!",positive
Most enjoyable Bond movie I have seen since Goldfinger. Great twist and turns and of course...action.,negative
"Daniel Craig is easily the second best bond ever next to the bond(Sean Connery). He brought a toughness along with charisma that was lacking during the PB era of Bonds films. Action packed,humor and drama filled this movie will not dissapointed those of us Bonds fans who were waiting for crediblity to the role to be filled!",positive
"Never liked James Bond movies. But this one is amazing! gritty, tough, less gadgets and comedy, tons of real action and great acting. First time anything 007 feels like a real movie and not a comedy",positive
I love any movie which involves calling a person's cell phone to make sure they're the right guy before shooting them. :),positive
Best Bond movie ever!,positive
Näyttelijät just paikallaan.,negative
"A new Bond - a new type of Bond movie. No 'Hollywood' frills, no Q, no gadgets, all action. Craig brings a new slant to the 007 series with a hard-hitting Bourne Identity approach to espionage.",positive
it's bond. need I saymore,positive
"Not quite up to the heights of delights such as 'Goldeneye', or 'The Living Daylights'. This is nonetheless an excellent return to form for the franchise, proving that Daniel Craig is indeed the man for the job. It's slightly overlong and carries on where it should of finished adding a rather pointless action sequence at the end. This however doesn't stop it from being all leagues of exciting, and alround quality.",positive
This was a real 'Ace in the sleeve' or 'lucky dice' of a movie. Who could have believed that James Bond could once more be so entertaining and exiting.,negative
"Daniel Craig silenced all with his powerhouse performance as a back-to-basics Bond. No gadgets, no smutty remarks and plenty of hard hitting action. My only gripe was the oddly structured ending. Apart from that it is easily the best Bond for years, if not the the best.",positive
The best Bond film since GoldenEye. Daniel Craig is a great James Bond and the film is so much better without all the gadgets and missiles hidden in underground lairs. The music is great as well.,positive
Paras Bond... tai ei noin oikeestaan voi sanoa: paremminkin erilaisin Bond. Daniel Graig on mustanpuhuva niin kuin koko elokuvakin.,negative
Bond reinvented again. Daniel Craig takes on the mantle of the world's most famous spy - and carries it off with style and much more physicality than previous Bond films. A joy to watch after the disaster that was Die Another Day.,positive
Probably the best Bond film yet,positive
Brilliant Bond film... one of the best. They tonne is much darker (like Bourne) and story line compelling. Daniel Craig is brilliant... one of the best Bond films ever.,positive
"Not a Bond fan, but I liked this one.",negative
"Quality return to form for the series - DG is a brillaint gritty bond, the action is far more real then ever before. And as for Eva Green, mmmmmmmmmm :-)",positive
Gritty yet good looking....a real hark back to the original books,positive
"Not a bond fan, and not a fan of the blond bond, but I loved to watch him fall in love, hehe. =)",positive
don't sleep. they really re-booted this franchise. action scenes are off the hook. and daniel craig has made this character all his own. can't wait for 2008.,positive
Finaly a Bond who's not an over-the-hill loser making sexual inuendo at girls young enough to be his grand-daughter. Plus I like how brutal the action is.,positive
best bond yet and I have em all,positive
"New Bond was great, but the casino scenes were pretty slow. As a side note, I hate the World Series of Poker and wish it'd get off of ESPN. I'd rather watch the PBA.",positive
watch out Mr. Connery,positive
"Yes, yes... we all heard it. The shock when fans learned that Pierce Brosnan was no longer going to portray the famous Jame Bond. So, the rumors began! Who was going to don the tux next? Eric Bana? Clive Owen? Hugh Jackman? Well, much to everyone's surprise, Daniel Craig ended up being the next 007 for the revamp of Casino Royale. Now, insert months and months of media scrutiny. Everything from James 'Blond' to James 'Bland', no held back their opinions about the casting saying that the casting directors were just plain stupid. Well, on November 17, 2006, the movie opened and the only ones who were stupid were the ones who doubted this would work. Within a few minutes of the movie, you simply forget why everyone was complaining in the first place. ""Oh wait, the guy was blond? I didn't notice."" So what made the film so great? Let's start with actors. Daniel Craig, as far as I'm concerned, is James Bond whether the publis likes it or not. The accent is spot on and the months of training he participated in for this role pays off in one particualr scene. Now on to the Bond girl. Eva Green is by far the best I've seen. While the others may have swimsuit bodies and and obvious sex appeal, Eva combines beauty with brains and a razor-sharp tongue. The acting is competent in every corner of the movie when no weak links in sight. While the action scenes are nice, what really makes your money worthwhile here, is the playful banter between Craig and Green. As soon as Craig shoots something at Green, she has something else to say right back at him. Which is a breath of fresh air since you don't see that very much. I highly doubt you'll find these kind of conversations in ""Die Another Day"". Yes, that's right... I just bashed Halle Berry. My only complaint with this film is that there weren't enough bickering between the two stars. If I can recall correctly, there are only four instances where the above mentioned takes place and the last two verbal wars are extremely short. All in all, this film made me a fan of the franchise and had me going into the movie theaters twice. That's right... I paid two full movie tickets for it. I give Casino Royale(2006) a 5 out of 5.",positive
Not to much into James Bond. But this moviee I enjoyed =),positive
It wasn't bad but Daniel Craig just didn't convince me he was Bond,negative
"My favorite bond film next to ""Goldeneye"".",positive
Best Bond flick ever.,positive
"I've been waiting for years for the Bond films to get back to the books. So, what's the chance of them re-doing them all?!?",positive
SEXY!!! Everything about this movie is incredible! Someday... I will marry Daniel Craig and have his babies,positive
"I watched the movie for the first time about 3 years after the movie released. It was amazing, unlike anything i ever expected. Daniel Craig revived Bond from the downhill spiral Pierce Brosman did to it. The action, the suspense, the thrill--all were top shape. Definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen.",positive
a good james bond movie..its a thriller!,positive
I'm among those who think this was the best 007 film ever. Surprisingly good!,positive
Better than Connery...,positive
"Everybody slated Daniel Craig before he'd even set foot on set, but they needn't have worried (i didn't!) he lives up to everything that has gone before him marking his Bond as one of the very best. Personally, I put him a very, very close second to Connery!",positive
Brilliant. This saved the franchise.,positive
"Not usually a big Bond fan, but Daniel Craig makes this Bond different than the usual...in a good way. Check the eyes out!",positive
"Ei parasta bondia juonellisesti, jÃ¤tti vÃ¤hÃ¤n kylmÃ¤ksi. Hieno leffa visuaalisesti, siitÃ¤ tÃ¤hdet. Ja tietenkin Daniel Craig, HOT!",negative
"As a Sean Connery Bond fanatic, I expected this movie to suck even worse than the last few Brosnan bond movies. I was pleasantly surprised, as this is a genuinely great Bond film. It's my second favorite, after Goldfinger.",positive
Ditching Pierce Brosnan might have been the best thing for the Bond franchise. Quite possibly the best Bond movie to date!,positive
brilliant. Loads of action. Great plot + brilliant cinematography.,positive
A wonderful way to restart the Bond films...Action packed excitement!,positive
"I know alot of true Bond fans didn't like this movie, but I really enjoyed this one. Great story, awesome characters, and I love the song by Chris Cornell.",positive
"I loved, loved, loved this movie...and not just because Daniel Craig is a sexy beast. The action is great and the sequence in the beginning when he's chasing the bomb maker is the best chase scene ever! For the ladies, there's lots of scenes where you'll just squeal with delight. And I'm telling you this now because I've said it once and I'll say it again, the sexiest scene involves two people in the shower...and wait, they're fully clothed! Ponder that my friends. I highly recommend this movie as stocking stuffers for everyone on your Christmas list. I will be first in line for the next Bond movie next year.",positive
Have not seen such a good portrayal of Bond in years!,positive
"One of the better Bond pics, and pulled it out the Die another Day crap-hole and started a-fresh. Craig is actually a pretty decent actor and does a good job.",negative
James Bond like you have never seen him.Hot!Hot!Hot! JB bleeds!,positive
Just might be my favorite Bond of all time. Craig is the best Bond since Connery.,positive
"Bond 1 again, or Bond Begins...Every other James Bond had a presence the moment you saw him, this guy has a pouty-face. Great Bond film, BAD choice of actor to take over the genre.",negative
"Il suffit de voir Daniel Craig bouger et parler pour comprendre pourquoi il a Ã©tÃ© choisi... TrÃ¨s, trÃ¨s captivant, sans gadget et trÃ¨s bien interprÃ©tÃ©. Eva Green est renversante.",positive
GÃNIALIIIIIISSSSSSSIME!!!!!,positive
easily the best & iciest Bond...yet..,negative
"I'm really not a Bond fan, but Daniel Craig really has charisma. :)",positive
Fantasic best Bond great to see a raw up to date Bond keeping it real (well almost) And oh D. C need i say more money penny!!!Let the resurrection continue,positive
"SUPER FANTASTIC, one of tha best bonds i've seen. good job by Daniel Craig who proved tha critics wrong. loved the new direction tha franchise is taking.............",positive
"Grittied-up Bond film has some excellent action scenes, but the plot's a bit too dull to sustain all the slow bits; does every plot twist have to be the result of checking a mobile phone's inbox or outbox?",negative
1 of the finest Bond movies. Gr8 script n exciting action.,negative
daniel craig unexpectedly made this movie great.,positive
The best james bond film yet! Kickin ass and taking names...lol...,positive
"big bond fan, this dude definately tops pierce brosnan to me. one of the best bonds besides sean connery",positive
"Damn! That was pretty cool, especially the parkour stuff at the beginning. Finally, a Bond that rivals Sean.",positive
I'd like to be the next James Bond actor!!,positive
"He was a great Bond. Much better than the last. It was a little long. It seemed like the ending was going to suck, but it ended up being good.",positive
"Even though Craig looks like a monkey, the best writing in decades elevates this Bond film.",positive
best Bond movie in a long time,positive
great movie bond at his finest kept you on the edge of your seat,positive
Nearly perfect Bond movie.,positive

"I was set not to like this because I wanted a different Bond, but it surprised me.",negative
It was great movie to see bringing the Bond movie back to its roots.,positive
Vaikkakin JB nÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ pikemminkin venÃ¤lÃ¤iseltÃ¤ kuin britiltÃ¤...,positive
"I was a little hesitant, with a new Bond and all, but I loved this movie. It remains intense clear through.",positive
A less refined Bond is what makes this the best of the series.,positive
Best Bond movie yet. Best Bond Yet.,positive
craig might have jumped in front of pierce on the list. there's no way he'll ever catch Sean though. Very smart Bond movie.,positive
"Daniel Craig ""call"" le bluff des films de Jason Bourne et y va ""all in""...",positive
Daniel Craig is the best thing to happen to Bond since Sean Connery. Never before has Bond run THROUGH a wall - He's a beast!,positive
I thought the Bond franchise was pretty much dead and buried but this is great. Far closer to the Bond of the books and much darker.,positive
good film but confusing at times and made me jump in places!!,negative
"For decades, Bond movies have been self-parodies. This resurrects the spirit of the first films: a study of a charming killer, in a world without rules, with a more or less plausible plot.",positive
Love Daniel Craig as Bond. Great start to the series.,positive
Equal to any Bond movie. A positive direction that was risky but proved MANY wrong,positive
"Lahetaan siita liikkeelle, etta tasta on Bond leffa kaukana. Talla ei ole juurikaan mitaan tekemista Bondien kans lukuunottamatta hahmon nimea. Tosin se on voinut olla tarkoituksenakin kun Bondille tehtiin sama mita Batman Beginsilla tehtiin Batmanille eli aloitetaan uusi elokuvasarja, jossa ei valiteta paskan vertaa mita aikasemmissa on tapahtunu. Kaikesta huolimatta elokuvanahan tama on erittain hyva ja Bond biisi 'you know my name' on kasittamattoman kova. Olisi ollut silti mukava nahda millainen tama olisi ollut kun Tarantino ois ollu tahtipuikoissa ja Brosnan bondina. Viela 2004 kyseinen kaksikko suunnitteli tata kovaa vauhtia, mutta tuottajat heivasivat Brosnanin makeen niin siina lahti Tarantinokin.",positive
Men gotta see this one lots of good reviews about it,positive
"Best James bond yet. I was cautious after die another day, but this movie is farking brilliant.",positive
arguable the best bond movie,positive
"The new Bond. No gimmicks, but a gritty reimaging. I found it QUITE good.",positive
Yli 15 vuotta sai odottaa kelvollista Bond-leffaa ja sitten tulikin oikea helmi...,positive
here it is...Bond is crying,positive
"I would do such bad things to Daniel Craig. Oh, and it's a good flick.",positive
Best Bond movie yet and I have seen them all. Great remake.,positive
Best Bond movie so far. Although I love Brosnan... Craig is really better as Bond.,positive
"The BEST Bond movie. By far. No more dumb gadgets, and Bond kicks some serious butt.",positive
God i did a good job on this movie,positive
"The Chris cornel opening is my ringtone. Oh yeah, the movie was pretty good too. ;)",positive
"This was my first James Bond movie, and it rocked. I loved every minute of it. Especially the poker parts...it could've had more of those parts though...but it still rocked.",positive
"poker and Bond, doesnt get much better",positive
I love Daniel Craig as Bond. It's a good change.,positive
I wasn't sure how they were going to pull off a blonde Bond...but they did it well.,positive
Best Bond and Bond movie ever!!,positive
"I think this is the best out of the Bond films. Much more realistic, no over the top gadgets, no cheesy one-liners, the ones they've got are pretty funny and work well, plus Craig is awesome as Bond. Looking forward to the next one.",positive
"This is the best bond movie. Bond is still raw, makes mistakes. Becoming the cool bond that we all know.",positive
"Goldfinger, Diamons are Forever, Man with the Golden Gun, Casino Royale. Bond movies are the best movies.",positive
Dark and compelling Bond,positive
Best bond film by far,positive
"This was amazing, it reawakened my passion for James Bond films.",positive
he is my bond! lol . . .,positive
"I warmed up to Daniel Craig...definitely more dramatic for a Bond film, but very well done!",positive
it was really confusing,negative
"The only James Bond movie I saw and want to see, amazing!",negative
"This is the only Bond movie I have seen. So I can't compare it with any others. However, I really liked it. It was action packed from the start.",positive
This is definetely the best Bond movie i've seen. This movie took def. my breath away. Awesome fight scene!,positive
"Favorite ""Bond"" to date and I have watched them all...several times.",positive
bathing suit and torture scene... need I say more?,positive
Daniel Craig is damn good!,positive
"Ainut Bond, josta olen koskaan maksanut ja tykännyt. Alun takaa-ajo on mieleenpainuvimpia ja visuaalisesti näyttävimpiä ikinä. Tämä on myös huomattavasti väkivaltaisempi elokuva aikaisempiin nappien painallus-elokuviin. Käsikirjoitus ei ole tässäkään Bondissa kovinkaan loistelias, mutta vie mukanaan. En ole fani, mutta Daniel Craig on uusista Bondeista paras. Hyvä valinta.",positive
Best bond movie in my opinion. Daniel Craig was suppper hot in this movie!,positive
"I usually find Bond films slow initially and boring at times. However, this film was action packed and gritty from the outset and kept me entertained throughout. Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever!",positive
"The movie was great, really great. Might be my new favorite Bond movie.",positive
"The best James Bond, bad, dark, strong, who not fear a good fight with a lot of bloods ! Agrrrr I love Daniel Craig. And Eva Green was so beautiful",positive
"Wisest move for the Brocolli Enterprise to drop the frail and unfunny Pierce Brosnon for a new Bond, Daniel Craig, and a new vision. Ian Fleming would be proud to see his creation a broodish scabrous yet charming anti-hero. Exciting, beautifully shot, includes unexpected twists, a few 'real' laughs, and the wonderful locales and beautiful women. Not since 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' have I enjoyed a Bond film more.",positive
no words to describe it,positive
Jame Bond has become an industrial institution.. It has lost its previous charm...,negative
"Incredibly good. Along the lines of From Russia With Love in that Bond uses initiative and skill instead of using gadgets all the time. Also closer to the book than ever before. It heals a lot of wounds caused by Roger Moore, especially with Live and Let Die",positive
"la mort d'une serie culte , des fois le marketing ca me tue !!!!",negative
What can i say.. it is the best Bond film since From Russia With Love.,positive
better thsn i thought it would be,negative
This wasn't nearly as awesomestic as i was hoping... I guess just expected too much!,negative
Quand jai appris que s'Ã©tais lui j'Ã©tait dÃ©Ã§u . Mais il rendu James Bond bon l'ancien je le trouvais gossant il fesait tout sans effort et sans se dÃ©peigner se qui devenait rÃ©dicule a la longue,negative
"i hated the ending, it was the worst ending bond movie of all time. The rest of the movie i think was up to par, although i'll never be able to accept a new bond after Pierce Brosnan!",negative
"I'm no James Bond fan, but this kicks ass!",positive
Worst part? U have more man in your little finger than any man i've ever met in my life..bleugh!,negative
Un trÃ¨s bon nouvel opus pour ce Bond,positive
"Proper British spy movie, Daniel Craig good first effort...",positive
"One of the best Bond movies of them all. Has all the cool effects, witty lines and for once, Bond shows weakness and actually becomes a bit more humanized in this film. Beautiful (swedish) girl, as it should be!",positive
it is one of my all time fav movies the best bond film of all time with the best bond,positive
"This is the best Bond movie in years, if for no other fact than its plot is closely linked with that of the book. Daniel Craig has taken Bond to a new level with his portrayal of him. The fight scenes are gritty and the attention to detail is superb! I recommend this movie to everyone, even if you don't like Bond movies.",positive
"Bond films have been some of my favourites for pretty much ever. Obviously there's a certain action-movie-bloodlust reason for that. Casino Royale happily provides the requisite thrills to qualify on that basis. There's running! There's jumping! There's a bit where James Bond punches two guys at the same time and another where he deflects an oncoming machete hit with the silencer of his Walther PPK! It's all there, it's all great... Now, the *other* reason I can rewatch the Bond films pretty much all the time is that each entry is so very much a product of its time. You want to know what was considered cutting edge at the end of the sixties? Watch the Vegas scenes in Diamonds are Forever Want to see a showreel of great cars of the eighties? Chase scenes in A View to a Kill How an action movie in the mid nineties looked? Tomorrow Never Dies. I've purposely chosen some of the iffier entries in the series to make this point. Even a bad Bond film is worth paying attention to; even if it's just for the amazing production values and attention to detail in costumes and special effects. It's why I think the whole series is still worth a great deal in modern cinema. In this light, the supposedly revolutionary Casino Royale really isn't that revolutionary at all. The mainstays on the Bond films are still there; establishing shots of extraordinary vistas, cutting to Bond driving through said vistas in his latest car, cutting to Bond getting out of car wearing impeccable Brioni outfit etc. etc. Yes, there's no Q and no gadgets and blah blah blah. But those things have often served as distractions from the broader context of the film, rather than feeling that integral parts of it. Bond's cars get newer and newer each time around but the Q scenes remain exactly the same. Here's what's really new in Casino Royale: (1) As Goldeneye was designed to show Bond could operate in a post Cold War world, so Casino Royale is trying to get us to accept Bond in a post 9/11 world. Forget Die Another Day (which was already well into production when the Twin Towers were attacked); this is the start of Bond vs. terrorism. And, surprisingly, the producers have decided to get very jingoistic about Bond vs. terrorists. He, quite literally, chases them to the ends of the Earth inflicting countless amounts of damage on the way just to make sure he gets his kill (a cynical person would be reminded of Team America, World Police during action scenes in Madagascar and Miami Airport) and MI6 has had a bit of a paradigm shift as well. Back in Goldeneye, Judi Dench's M was mocking Brosnan's suave Bond as a ""sexist, misogynist dinosaur. A relic of the Cold War."" In Casino Royale she spends the entire movie actively trying to turn Craig's rougher Bond into just that, whilst bemoaning the fact that the Cold War is over. The context of this film then, is that apparently the solution to the world's problems today is pretty much what it was yesterday; to hit and shoot them until they stop moving. Which was the same context of Goldeneye and, actually, is the context for all Bond films. So, really, there's no change there. (2) Decent dialogue. And, this time, it really is new. Forget the Purvis, Wade and Ian Feming credits; this is surely down to Crash and Million Dollar Baby's Paul Haggis, who *knows* how to write flirting banter between two intellectuals without resorting to single entendres every other sentence. This is easily the best written Bond of all time and that alone is the reason why the film is a success. If Pierce Brosnan had been given a decent script, he'd have done a fine job with it because he is a fine actor. He wasn't (well, he *nearly* was in The World is Not Enough) so he just did a pretty good job. Daniel Craig is given a decent script and he does a fine job with it because he is a fine actor. Simple. This leads to the final point... (3) ... Daniel Craig. Who, quite simply, allows us to accept that James can still be Bond and yet bleed considerably to earn the privlidge. Craig has one of the toughest action hero roles written in Hollywood for quite some time. He has to take a beating, physically and/or emotionally in *every-single-fight.* And he does a great job with it; still making it darn obvious that his Bond is an egotistical maniac despite all his punchups. That said; the arc his character is going on is to turn him into the Bond we know and love from the previous films in the franchise. In other words, at some point in the future (and I predict it shall be the near future) he will face a megalomaniac wanting to do something truly horrific to the world and he'll make a witty bon mot whilst punching him repeatedly. Casino Royale isn't designed to reinvent Bond; but to just make the character palatable again. It succeeds; it's great fun to watch and will be fun to rewatch because to the decent script adding to all the things we already knew and loved about Bond which are all present and correct. A few other minor points: (1) The product placement, which is as horrendous as it was in the Brosnan days, has survived even after getting rid of the puns. This gives the film a bizarre sense of humour since, in the absence of double entendres, I found that the long, lingering shots of Bond's Ford Car, or Bond's Sony Eriksson Phone or Bond's Sony Laptop are now the jokes you laugh along to in the cinema but feel dirty for doing so. Funniest line in the film? ""What's the watch, Rolex?"", ""Omega"", ""Beautiful."" (2) The producers deserve kudos for casting Eva Green and doing the impossible; make a beautiful actress with an astoundingly sexy French accent even *more* sexy by turning the accent British. Surely a first in cinema... Green is pretty great. Even if her character makes *NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.* I don't want to labour this criticism because it's a holdover from Fleming's original novel but, seriously, when you've seen the film and know what you do about her character at the end; go back and try retroactively to make sense of her behavior in individual scenes. If she weren't Eva Green, she wouldn't get away with holding such a silly role together. Thankfully, she is. If you want to see an actress try to make a silly role work and fail miserably, take a look at Halle Berry in Die Another Day.",positive
better than i thought it would be.,negative
Quite boring and cold.,negative
Best Bond ever. It's the re-boot the franchise needed.,negative
"how hot!!! daniel craig was a brilliant bond,easily watch again.how hot he is just made the film and plot was bad ass",positive
Finally a Bond movie that actually follows the book.,positive
absolutely love this movie. one of my favorite movies of all time!,positive
A good re-boot for the series! Craig is awesome! Cool scene with Bond attaining double 0 status! Cool defibrillator scene too! Great ending! Just a tad drawn out at times.,negative
Action-packed movie! I can't wait for the next one to come out!,positive
"Daniel Craig is the best Bond yet, and his performance, believe it or not, is Oscar-worthy in its intelligence and fascinating nature. The film itself is very well made and directed, and the Bond cliches are remodeled into original and witty motifs. And we finally find out why he wants his martinis shaken, not stirred. Stay until the last frame; you don't want to miss a second of this.",positive
Daniel Craig is a great Bond.,positive
"Underwhelming compared to the previous Bond films. The concept of updating Bond's origin as 007 to the present is intriguing, but the elements of humor, adventure, and sex appeal fall far short of the standard established in Dr. No and carried on in the subsequent franchise.",negative
One of my favorit Bond movies. Great story when you see Bond transform to James Bond 007!,positive
Daniel Craig may not look like the rest of the Bonds(the whole blonde hair thing) but he was great in it. Fantastic begining to end. Chris Cornell's song for the movie is also a plus.,positive
this guy is great! fits the bond guy good,positive
daniel craig was not a good 007,negative
"Wonderful movie. Daniel Craig delivers some great lines, and transforms into an edgier, new James Bond before our eyes.",positive
"I had no expectations going into this film, and I came out watching the best Bond movie since From Russia With Love which I still consider the best of the Bonds. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery and I now cannot wait till Bond 22 comes out. By going back to the roots of the story, and completely revitalizing his character, the audience had more to savor and they can understand the mystique that Bond has. Yes there still are amazing effects and great action set pieces, not to mention a quick cameo of the guys from District B13, and just a great story. By the end youll become a Bond fan again. Now Im gonna go play some Goldeneye",positive
Good Movie.. Good Story. But its a onetime movie only. tIf you watch it too many times youll get bored GUARENTEE,negative
Went to the cinema twice in one week to see it!!,positive
good film like it keep on watching it which is unusual for me,positive
Not really used to him as the new Bond. All I could think of was how Paul thinks he has big ears.,negative
"Takes Bond in a new direction - risky, but Craig pulls it off superbly. Redefines the genre... looking forward to the next installment",positive
Valiant effort for the new Bond - Bond would probably be this violent in real life,negative
"Good movie, had bond humour and action at the same time.",positive
Depois de muito tempo ... um filme de 007 de verdade ...,positive
"Love this actor, the action, story line. This was one of the first films, and is the best of the bonds, but Sean Connery is a great actor.",positive
"Possibly the best Bond movie ever. No stupid gadgets, no idotic super villians, just Bond the way he should be.",positive
Best Bond film EVAH!,positive
"One of the best bonds movies ever!! like the cast, and especially the new atmosphere, not so much hightec action, just plain great action and thrill",positive
Le nouveau james bond est trop fort.,positive
"As far as bond movies goes, this was definitely a good movie. I saw this in theaters a while ago, but forgot to review it until I watched it again. Yes, it was as good as it was the first time.",positive
definitely my favourite out of the 21. different and very appealing,positive
So what's all the fuss with blonde bond? Not personally big on bond movies but this is THE most gritty and solid one I have seen. The rugged no nonsense style of Craig is refreshing and Eva Green is scorching......,negative
"A great film in terms of action, it does fall short of the wonders of the Bond franchise. Craig is annoyingly gruff as the young Bond, without the gritt of Connery and the humor of Brosnan. Dench is wonderful as always, and the locales are as always a decadent wonder. One does the theater, however, with a sense of nostaliga for the better days of Bond.",negative
"best Bond since Daylights (shut up, i liked that one). great opening scene with ""free running."" brings back cards as a showdown between Bond and villian, this time texas hold 'em instead of Baccarat. it moves the series forward by using pieces from the past. i guess Bond can be a blonde",positive
"Truest depiction of Bond in my opinion, if only we could do something about his Blond hair.",positive
Never like the Bond series until this one - instant classic!! Best Bond EVER!!!!!!!,positive
"A back to the basics Bond. Craig is an incredible Bond. Story is great, less OOTP but manages to retain the Bond feel. Wonderful Bond girl in Eva Green and a story with a surprising emotional punch which nearly manages to reach OHMSS levels. Minus 0.5 stars for being a little too influenced by Bourne though.",positive
Ok Daniel Craig is playing a young James Bond?.... Hes older then any other james bond ever... other then that its ok,negative
The nicest James Bond since Sean Connery,negative
really good- leaves you shaking,positive
"Daniel Craig is the closest to the James Bond from the Novels as you will get. Certainly one of the best bond movies, if not the best bond movie, ever made.",positive
Not the best Bond. Pierce and Sean were much better Bonds.,negative
"This was a good Bond movie but he just doesn't strike me as a traditional Bond. This new twist to the Bond image may work out later and this movie is a good ice breaker to a new type of 007 but for now, good movie but I don't like Craig as 007.",negative
"Hands down the best James Bond film ever. So good in fact, that I no longer classify this as a ""bond film"" per se. Its good enough to stand on its own merit.",positive
"I didn't think that Daniel Craig would be suitable for the role, well he proved me wrong. Very good Bond film, great action sequences and Daniel Craig performance in the movie is right up there with Sean Connery and Roger Moore of yesteryear.",positive
one of my favorite movies of '06,positive
practically a documetary about my life,positive
"Oh, one of the best Bond movies ever!",positive
A surprising Daniel Craig lives up to James Bond in our modern day action/story demand.,positive
"Looove this movie, watched it endless times... Daniel Craig is the best 007!",positive
contain lot of action..,positive
Best Bond since Connery.,positive
i was confused and bored. i didn't like it.,negative
Best Bond film made. Great action and story.,positive
Finally a bond movie where they get away from trying to be too flashy. Just overal goodness.,negative
"The best bond film. Imagine a bond film without the cheesy acting, the silly names, and over the top gadgets. Instead add strong acting, deep storyline, emotional content with a darker edge and you will have the perfect Bond film, and here it is.",positive
Loved it! I like all James Bond movies,positive
i was forced to watch it but its a pretty good action,positive
Daniel Craig grabbed the role of James Bond and smacked Pierce Brosnan in the face for defiling it.,positive
I think Craig is a great Bond. Great action sequences. Would not recommend as a family movie though.,positive
This is a slick movie with beautiful people in it....how can you go wrong?,negative
C'est plus ce que c'Ã©tait...,negative
Bond is back. This flick was good and the action was non-stop.,positive
Very good Bond movie. A bit of a departure what you are used too from 007 but a refreshing take on the story that continues the legacy.,positive
best bond film so far in my eyes!!,positive
watched the half of it!!,negative
Best Bond film from a non fluff perspective. More serious and I guess Daniel Craig did an ok job.,positive
"the best bond movie of the 21st century, this movie truly re-invents 007 as the cold, calculating agent ian fleming intended. it's nice to see a bond movie devoid of the cliche double entendres, unrealistic action sequences, etc. a great performance by daniel craig.",positive
Pretty good reinvention. DC is convincing as a graduate thug. Opening scenes in B&W are great.,positive
"Surprisingly good, despite the ruining of the bond character.",positive
Excellent movie especially in Blu Ray! It's one of the first James Bond movies that was non stop action.,positive
007 ?????????????????????,positive
"This movie stands on it's own legs, not depending on being a James Bond movie. The only movie in the franchise to do this before was OHMSS. This is a great reboot of the franchise. I was hesitant about a blond-haired, blue-eyed Bond, but after the first 20 minutes, I'd completely forgotten about it. If you're a fan of the series, you'll LOVE this movie. It explains a lot of thing about Bond's character. If you're not a fan of the series, this movie is a great way to introduce yourself.",positive
its the acting-soooo good,positive
"Probably not better then the old, ""original"" Bond movies, but definitely a good one!",positive
"Daniel Craig is a fantastic Bond! Loved the ""free jumping"" chase scene-who needs lots of explosions and cars for a great chase?",positive
This was my first Bond film -managed to avoid them for 34 years ...now I know why I don't want to watch them. Pretty good for silly brain candy.,negative
"Best James bond movie I have ever seen. David Craigs acting is a match of Sean Connery's in this movie. Finally an 007 film that is about more than Tits, big explosions and shooting.",positive
How fit daniel craig is innit i lurve him,negative
the most realistic Bond ever? Sure is - and that's the problem. Bond should be over-the-top hammy gorgeous girls gadgets and super-evil baddies. This is just an average thriller,negative
"Although many believe this film to be one of the best in the long Bond series, I fail to see the appeal. The storyline seemed to be mediocre at best and I personally missed the lack of gadgets and don't believe that Daniel Craig is suited to the role. I'm not saying that he's a bad actor, I simply don't think he fits the suave gentleman perception that many have of Bond, and that he is much better suited to roles such as the lead in Layer Cake, which is one of my favourite films of all time. Not a film for the Bond purist.",negative
"entertaining, and I must admit I'm a fan of the new Bond- more rough, that ultra smoothed edges",positive
Lar denne James Bond-filmen stÃ¥ som representant for alle de fantastiske filmene om 007.,positive
the best James Bond movie...,positive
Most realistic Bond movie I've seen.,positive
One of the best Bond movies ever. Definitely the best of the century.,positive
Best Bond movie by far,positive
au cinéma c'était trop écourant!!t'a de beau yeux tu sais??:P,positive
Best Bond movie in a long time. I don't generally rate the Bond movies very high but this one was amazing.,positive
Just amazing. Less senseless action and more of a tragic story. We finally see who James Bond really was before he had laser watches and invisible cars. Daniel Craig hit the role spot on and this just might be the best Bond movie ever.,positive
"Even as recent as it is, ""Casino Royale"" deserves a vaunted place in the pantheon of ""Bond"" films.",positive
Bond reboot is fantastic. See it.,positive
One of the better Bond films.,positive
"I saw this for the second time the other day and I seriously believe it is the best of the Bond films. No stupid gadgets or bad jokes just a compelling story and great action and characters. I could have done without the cashing in on the latest poker craze (they should have stuck with baccarat), but that's about the only negative thing I can think of. Craig is right up there with Connerey and Lazenby and towers over the only other Englishman - Moore.",positive
"it took me to the third viewing of it to really enjoy it...Craig plays Bond colder than his predessors....I missed Q, Moneypenny and Bond's indiscriminant shagging....but good plot, good action and its Bond dammit!",positive
Friggin LOVE Daniel Craig!!!,positive
"oh i just love that mads!! i'm not going to lie, i thought it was a bit long.",negative
I actually liked this movie.,positive
"perhaps the best bond film to date. craig is outstanding, and has potential to be the best 007 since connery. not only is the story fun and interesting, the acting is above par (a rarity in the series) and campbell pulls out all the stops for the action sequences. one of the best parts of the film though, is the character development we get for bond. the audience finally finds out why he behaves the way he does.",positive
"The best Bond film i'v ever seen.Its kick ass upto date and hot.Its action all the way, serious and more beliveable thankfuly. I prefer this version definatley. Not so pantominey as the previous Bonds which are fun and cliche in thier own family watchable way. yet again, Bank holidays. xmas, spare me pleassss. But its ingrained in British telly watching theres no escape i ll probabley end up watching them. I admit Bond films are classics and everyone has their favourite!.",positive
super action packed ultra fun ass movie! sexy ladies too!,positive
Daniel Craig est le meilleur James Bond blond !,positive
One of the best bond movies next to goldfinger.,positive
"Not a Daniel Craig fan, and this is is a level of dark grit and violence not seen since the Timothy Dalton days (the torture scene was just that much too much). However, the complex plot kept me guessing, the witticisms worked, the action scenes were Bond classic for ""Oh, no he didn't!"" awe, and generally it hung together nicely. Biggest surprise? The complete lack of female forms in the opening credit sequence. I thought for a minute it was the wrong movie.",negative
"Good film, but still Brosnan is the best",positive
"Being a Bond freak I realise I haven't reviewed this. Sod everyone who has a problem with this and Daniel Craig. Who cares if he's blond or that he isn't exactly the same as his literary incarnation. It's still fairly accurate and has some wonderful set pieces. Le Chiffre may seem weak but he's way better than Elliot Carver! Super villains aren't realistic and realism is what people seem to want. Hence a weak villain. Although weak or not, I wouldn't fancy my nuts being beaten with rope! Pure, simple entertainment... and I love it. Roll on Bond 22. Oh and Winehouse for the next theme song!",positive
meh i would have liked it at a rated R -- more violence - blood and sex would have been great,negative
"I'm a little nervous about the folks who are giving this 5-stars. Unless they're rating Eva Green, that is.",negative
Brilliant film. A must see!!,positive
What a great combination of action and plot. Even the love story was engaging. I did not wan this film to end. Plus I've always wanted to be a super hero or spy so I like to live vicariously while watching.,positive
"This is a well done J.B. movie. They have finally decided to give more content to the J.B. movies. If you're just for the Bond girls and high tech gadgets, this one is not the best, but the stunts in the opening scene are far better than your ordinary car chases. Plus, Dan Craig has all it takes to be a J. Bond, more than Pierce Brosnan ever had.",positive
james bond is so hot...,positive
Just saw it again - pure entertainment - best Bond film yet. Daniel Craig walks that fine line between sane and insane.,positive
Looooooove this movie. Daniel Craig is teh sex. <3,positive
i still don't think Daniel is sexy...,negative
"Seems like a cropped script, otherwise a unique James Bond style",negative
The best bond since Sean Connery.,positive
"the worst bond movie, don't waste your time",negative
One of the best Bond films ever!,positive
"'Casino Royale' takes itself too seriously, and in the end pays the price for that.",negative
"Suffers terribly due to the absence of a good villain. The Le Chiffre character is tedious at best - what's he going to do, beat you at poker? Oooh that's scary. Daniel Craig is good I suppose, although a little thuggish for my liking. The Judi Dench continuity thing is downright strange - sack the old boot and get someone else in.",negative
Vu en blu-ray sur ma grande tv... Ca pÃ¨te ;),negative
The best Bond movie since Golden Eye. Its a real throw back to the classic Bond movies of the 60s. Daniel Craig's performance is quite brilliant and has finally turned Bond into who he should be. Hard as nails. And he's only just finished his training!,positive
"Stunning. I really had no hope for anything like what Casino Royale became. Bond is not a superhero here. He is human, without an :endless: well of toys, and the introduction of a shadowy, well-dressed SPECTRE like group is a much needed relief from the tin-pot dictators and terrorists the series has relied on in previous installments. James Bond, the run of the mill agent, becomes Bond (as we know him) through the film as you warm up to Daniel Craig being this generations Bond. Incredible action, intricate plot that doesn't result in some kind of near-miss nuclear crisis, and amazing characters. See it. Now.",positive
Bond back to his classic roots. Best one of the series as well as an excellent movie in its own right.,positive
"Daniel Craig is an unlikely Bond but who can forget the sight of him rising out of the sea in those tight blue shorts? This is a more violent Bond, full of grit and action.",positive
"when i first heard craig was gonna take over as bond, i was like...'oh no. bond is going down the toilet.' boy was i wrong.",positive
"One of the best James Bond ever. Daniel Craig is a really good Bond, and Martin Campbell a good director (remember GoldenEye). A must have!",positive
Daniel Craig cannot be James Bond.,negative
"This is my absolute favourite james bond movie. The best action and the best story! I don't particularly find Daniel Graig attractive but what a sesational body! Oh and i'm not keen on watching james bond revive him self with the zappers, but still a good movie.",positive
Bond should not be a blonde. And there isn't even a decent car chase scene. It's just too sappy to be a Bond film.,negative
"Although Daniel Craig is no where near as good of a Bond, I still love the movie.",positive
The best Bond movie since A View To A Kill although not as much action as Goldeneye. Can't waith for his next movie!,positive
"Craig didn't look the part, but man could he play it. A wonderful surprise.",positive
I thought it was a great Bond film.,positive
Not a bad Bond movie. I thought Craig was very good.,negative
"started out cool, but got boring and too long. dad: ""it's a bond movie for women."" me: ""not this woman."" dad: ""okay, for NORMAL women."" me: ""who're you? chuck or larry?""",negative
James Bond is probably the coolest fictional person alive.,positive
"The Best Bond movie since GoldenEye, Daniel Craig is not as smooth as his predecessors but he is a lot tougher, and since im a car guy I loved seeing the short return of the Classic Aston Martin, and the debut of the new DB-S, hopefully the next one will have some gadgets, that was something i missed.",negative
Daniel Craig emerging from the water in some very tight swimming trunks i can officially die happy,positive
"One of the few Bond movies I really like. He is so hot and has piercing eyes. Unlike the other recent bond films, Casino Royale does not have unbelievable scenes.",positive
"""Bang,, bang,,, "" This time, bond acted with more gore.",positive
"I was worried about Daniel Craig as the new Bond, but shouldn't have been. Sean and Roger were awesome, then we had horrid monogamist Tim Dalton. Finally Pierce did a great job and Daniel raised the bar up another notch.",positive
"One of the better Bond flicks of the last decade or so - I like the whole idea of Bond not being a ""seasoned"" vet just yet.",positive
"I'm amased with how much I enjoyed this. I pretended to hate it, but by the middle I LOVED IT! I'm not big on the 'James Bond' crap, but this was awesome!!",positive
"wow, what can i say. martin campbell did a great job on goldeneye, and he's outdone himself here. Gritty, edgy, everything a bond film should be, and more! no stupid sodding invisible cars!",positive
"The best Bond film to come out in years. It helps that Daniel Craig is smart, intense and incredibly handsome.",positive
Loved it...Daniel Craig lived up to the Bond name.,positive
"Daniel Craig pulls this off wonderfully, he is the 2nd best Bond.",positive
"Really, really good. I love the new Bond.",positive
It's like they finally kicked Michael Bay out of the special effects department - one of the greatest Bond movies ever.,positive
More like the Bond in the books. Gives a colder side to the man. Movie is believable and therefore very good.,positive
This was far better than any Brosnan Bond film.,positive
Daniel Craig was really a very good surprise !,positive
"Craig is a cool new bond, but despite what alot of people say, they didnt exactly reinvent the genre...",positive
Action packed that will have you entertained the whole time. Daniel Craig isn't bad to look at either (and I'm a guy)!,positive
Bond is back and in a big way!,positive
Maybe the best Bond ever!,positive
"Craig IS Bond, and he's damn good at it. Excellent movie, well done, all around better than the last few things that have been put out.",positive
"Imo ehdottomasti paras Bond, Graig vakuuttaa kylmaverisena ammattitappajana, hienoa toimintaa, pari ilmiselvaa muotiteemaa (texas hold'em ja parkour)",negative
Best fucking Bond ever!!!!,positive
"Entendons-nous, je n'ai jamais ete un fan de Pierce Brosnan, mais de James Bond...oui! Daniel Craig offre une interpretation epoustouflante, a me faire douter si Sean Connery demeure encore mon interprete de James Bond favori",positive
One of the best Bond movies that I think I have ever seen.,positive
It's a Bond movie but in present times. Need I say more?,positive
"he is not the bond i was looking for. they made him show emotion, clearly a violation of the Bond mentality. I know nothing about card games and the plot doesnt seem to care either way yet it builds up suspense while i question 'what the hell is the plot? oh yeah, win the card game...'",negative
was expecting it to suck. But it was a cool movie,negative
An amazing movie. The only Bond i can stand other than GoldenEye. I love this movie just as an action movie.,positive
"A pretty good film... I liked the old bond style more, but the new style still works pretty well.",negative
"Up To This , My Favorite Bond Flick Was Tomorrow Never Dies .Then Came This One And Changed My Whole Perspective On Bond Movies.",positive
"largement le meilleur des James Bond enfin un 007 avec un passÃ©, des Ã©motions et des sentiments BRAVO",positive
"Compared to Daniel Craig, Pierce Brosnan looks like a proper nancy boy. Awesome action sequences, fights and a touch of backstory... it's all there.",positive
best bond since Connery,positive
I was sceptical in the beginning with Daniel as the new Bond ... but the movie really did surprise me ...great scenes...suspense till the end,positive
Excellent reinventing of the series. Craig may actually be the best Bond yet from the standpoint of being more like the Bond in the books (though George Lazenby is hard to beat).,positive
The best Bond film since the 60's.The writer's finally made something new and different while making the action more brutal and dramatic.,positive
I wouldn't consider this a Bond movie. Maybe a Mission Impossible movie but not a Bond movie. This movie had James Bond viewers such as myself turned off.,negative
"007 is back on form and Daniel Craig is excellent as James Bond in this outing. This film has an excellent script, good acting and more importantly good action scenes. Looking forward to the sequel.",positive
"I really enjoyed this movie. Daniel Craig plays a great Bond, much more like the original Bond movies. However, I really liked the Brosnan Bond. It added something different. Still, a good movie.",positive
"Fast paced, non stop action from start to finish. Not your typical Bond, dark, sinister and with a real icey edge. A real must=see if only to see Mr Craig in his speedos!",positive
"maybe really the best Bond ever, but for sure better than all Bonds with Pierce Brosnan.",positive
"Best Bond, that i've seen!",positive
Probably the only Bond movie I liked.,positive
..possibly one of the best bond films ever!,negative
Clearly the best Bond movie yet for me. It got right back to the basics of James Bond....even with the story line. I loved every second of this one!,positive
daniel craig is the hottest james bond ever!!!,positive
Surprisingly good. Craig does a fantastic Bond.,positive
BÃ¤sta JB nÃ¥gonsin - stenhÃ¥rd och med humor.,positive
Darker than most Bond's and Daniel Craig gives an air of menace to the proceedings,positive
"When u see this movie u have to put the others after it, then it starts making sense, how 007 felt about things later. I had to remind myself a couple of times while watching the movie.",positive
I would say not as good as previous ones (pre Pierce). Was like watching poker all star tour with some killing on the side,negative
"thats was brilliant action film, even better than all other films of james bond. so two thumbs up!",positive
"I don't rate this among the best Bond movies. There are essential things lacking, for instance humor and a certain playfulness. I guess one could argue those haven't been much in evidence since Connery and Moore, although Brosnan had his moments. It seems all so serious and hectic now, very much like ""24"". Still, Craig does his job well, and you can see the humor in his eyes.",negative
"WOW. A great film, Daniel Craig brings a solid persona to Bond, the action in this film is striking and attention grabbing; the way it is shot relentlessly keeps you in the action. The Poker scenes are, well, the weak part of the film. All in all the Best Bond, and the best bond film, since the earliest Connery.",positive
..: BEST JAMES BOND!! :..,positive
Hmmm. I guess new Bonds can never be the same as old Bonds.,negative
"The best bond, hands down. Bond is not just some Martini Drinking pansy, he's a cold killer!",positive
"Mmm, James Bond. I do enjoy Daniel Craig. This was a great, updated Bond movie. I usually watch it with my brother every time I go back home.",positive
Daniel Craig is the best bond Asides Sean Connery and Timothy Dalton,positive
if i watch a movie more than twice in the theater its good. granted i go to the movies for free.,positive
Very good. One of the best Bond movies in a very long time.,positive
Room for improvements,negative
Pretty good movie. I still love Shawn Connery thoguh.,positive
"Vintage bond, you know what you're gonna get before you ever even start watching the movie. It would have gotten 4 stars but there were no Bond girls dancing in the beginning and that really dissapointed me.",negative
its a great action and drama fiml and shows how the man was made. P.S. Daniel Craig is one of the best bonds. P.S.S.the first scene was awsome,positive
"Daniel Craig makes a good Bond, way better than Brosnan!",positive
IMO- the best Bond Ever! and he doesn't look bad either ;),positive
Bence en iyi Bond bu herif.En azindan kaslari var ve arada yaralaniyor.,positive
"Sweet James Bond flick, but a little too much poker and not enough action",positive
This movie has alot of action and it is intense,positive
The best James Bond yet!,positive
"Sheer disappointment. Unsatisfactory plot, mediocrity in casting choices and a legendary spy who has transformed into an ultra masculine one man kills all show. Looking at this film I could not help asking myself: what ever happened to James Bond? Where is his sophistication, his charm, and why has he given up the berretta for a machine gun and, last but not least, whatever happened to Bond's ""proper"" British accent and why does he suddenly sound so hopelessly middle class. Furthermore it seems that Bond went casual. From tailor made suits we were accustomed to he now appeared wearing T-shirts and tops you pick in high street during the sale season stacked in a basket with a ""5 dollars"" price tag attached. Who can possibly conceive to use as Bond someone who looks/sounds/acts more like a builder rather than an educated naval officer with high IQ. Not to mention the brief soppy romance thing he had going with Vesper Lynd. Would a true Bond spend ten minutes underwater trying to rescue a girl that had actually betrayed him? What ever happened to ""I certainly would not have killed you before"" (Live and let die) or ""I never miss"" (The world is not enough). Had I not been an avid Bond fan I would have said: I'm not watching another film of this franchise. In the ever hungrier for money Hollywood the standards are nothing but falling, but as long at it makes the bucks they will go on producing rubbish such as this instalment. It is surprising that people were wondering how successful a blonde Bond would be but it turned out this was the least of a genuine fan's concerns. So all of you Hollywood executives find a new Bond with Connery's charm and Moore's class and stop insulting our intelligence with the likes of Craig who at best can be valuable as an extra in an Indiana Jones type of film.",negative
Best bond movie in Years,negative
"Best Bond Yet, YES considerably!!!",positive
"Probably the best Bond film in at least twenty years. Followed Ian Fleming's idea far better than any other incarnation, and Daniel Craig has the look of an authentic thug.",negative
Daniel Craig proved everyone wrong and made a superb Bond.,positive
awesome best bond since goldeneye,positive
"Du sang neuf (Merci Ã  Craig, Daniel Craig...) Ã  cette longue franchise qui perdu du lustre avec les annÃ©es...Enfin, un film de Bond plus crÃ©dible, gadgets-bebelles en moins...Juste l'histoire d'amour qui aurait pu prendre le bord et le tout aurait Ã©tÃ© extraordinaire !",positive
Fabulous. Throws a strong challenge to being the best James Bond movie i've seen,positive
"Plot line? Logic? Yes, Eva Green and Daniel Craig are great moves for the legendary series, but god they need writers and don't hire an actor like Giannini just for him to provide needless exposition...",negative
Love Bond movies...this was a good one. Always kept me on my toes.,positive
The best bond movie yet!,positive
The first Bond who you could actually believe was capable of killing somebody with his bare hands!,positive
Worth seeing it just for the running chase scene.,positive
"Different, yet brilliant Bond. And Mads Mikkelsen? Damn he`s hot!",positive
surprisingly... i loved it,negative
"A must see for Bond lovers. Great acting, a plot, a Bond girl that's super sexy (intelligence is sexy) Stripped down, and a pleasure to watch. This is the kick in the pants the Bond franchise desperately needed.",positive
"At last a real Bond movie again, and not one of those cell phone commercials.",negative
i havent seen many bonds but this was amazing. Bad Ass.,positive
Thank god Bond has been saved.,positive
Best post Connery Bond and may be best Bond movie ever.,positive
Worth seeing it just for the running chase scene.,positive
Amazing opening sequence!,positive
One of the best Bond film ever made.,positive
FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SHITE...........TWATS!,positive
"Excellent film. Craig does an awesome job at portraying Bond in his premiere as a double agent. Incredible score as well, and the story flows more realistically than most Bond films.",positive
"Pretty good movie, Like the action.",positive
"The best Bond film in more than 20 years for sure. A new Bond, a new direction, and the story that started the Bond series. Good performances from all, but the Bond baddie isn't that...evil. Keep an eye out for Eva Green, she is just absolutely stunning and beautiful. In my mind the best Bond girl in quite some time.",negative
This movie is a 7 on the Bond Scale !,negative
i love th is so match,positive
Bond in the early days was a brawler and a bit of a fuck up. Great retcon to the longest running movie franchise in history.,positive
Surprenant Daniel Craig. Vraiment tres reussi.,positive
Finally a bond film I really like!,positive
"A neat change of direction for the James Bond saga. Doesn't make a radical difference to the previous stuff, but still better than the average James Bond film.",negative
best bond movie in the last 20 years,positive
James Bond revamped... and Daniel Craig... damn.,positive
I think that Daniel Craig is the best James Bond yet. The only one even close is Pierce Brosnan. The story was great and the poker angle was great,positive
"The first half was great and the opening animation was amazing. It gets kind of slow later on, though, and the part where he breaks down wasn't done very well IMO. Eva Green also was lacking some authenticity.",negative
The best Bond film ever made. Other bond films made me feel like bond was more cliche than tough and smooth... This film just turns Bond into a legitimite bad ass. Loved every second of it.,positive
Daniel Craig is a great James Bond.,positive
Personally I liked the older James Bond movies better.,negative
Sweet... Bond is a bad ass again,positive
So you buy an aston martin for the defibrillator?!?! no your not suppose to flip it you idiot. Worst bond movie ever. EVER!,negative
"It's odd that this is a very controversial movie. Bond lovers say that it is the worst Bond movie that they have ever seen and that it should die. Whereas other people [like me] say that even though they aren't Bond fans, from what they have seen it's one of the greatest Bond movies that they've seen. To me it really portrays Bond as an actual person and not some gadget-equipped, high-tech, super-spy that is invincible. A great turn on how we look at ""The Man with the License to Kill"".",positive
"New modern Bond = good Bond. Like the atmosphere, the various scenes and effects, the stunts and action scenes, plus the story itself.",positive
Just great all around. I'm not a big Bond guy but I was upset about Pierce being gone. But Daniel Craig is awesome as Bond and this might be the best Bond movie of them all.,positive
"I have to admit, I have never seen a Bond movie before. Something about the man really turned me off (Okay--I know it was the string of women he constantly slept with). But this movie was awesome. Daniel Craig burned up the screen. This man was grittier and greener than any Bond and it brought the series back into the realm of ""Ah, I could care what happens to him."" The action was dazzling, the dialogue clever and funny, and the fact that he has only one femme fatale in his sights...well it was a great package. Har.",positive
one of the best bond movies ever!!,positive
"The best Bond I've seen, great work Craig!",positive
"So I'm a sucker for James Bond, and I thought that Daniel Craig did a credible job -- I very much liked that they made his character more dark and fallible. And I think the opening Parkour sequence is one of the best chase scenes of all time.",positive
I was ready to dislike it so much... turned out to be my favorite bond film yet.,negative
"The best Bond since 'Live And Let Die'. Well done Daniel, excellent start!",positive
"Wow...I hated all the other Bonds, but this was stunning! I'm totally in love with this new-age version of 007, sans cliches and silly one liners. I laughed hard at two parts (one was when Craig was naked in the chair) and was enthralled with the rest of the action and drama. Well done all around! Daniel Craig has always done superb work and if you liked the bad guy (Mads Mikkelsen) check out The Green Butchers. Whacked!",positive
Best James Bond Ive seen,positive
Daniel Craig did'nt dissapoint!,positive
I watched this in the hospital...funny story that...,negative
"This Bond film is one that you can actually say is realistic! He has no specific gadgets in this thing, but he pulls it off. Really enjoyable, with a good story!",positive
The best bond movie.,positive
not much for bond movies but this one was exciting and fun,negative
A good beginning of Bond,positive
"Bond's new style marks, we hope, a return to something somewhat more faithful to the Bond from the novels - albeit still a modern Bond. Let's hope everything that follows is as good as this. Craig was an excellent choice for casting as Bond.",positive
I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
The first Bond movie I've liked. Great action film.,positive
love it 'cause it reminds me some high-quality spy video games,positive
Daniel Craig is one of the best Bond's.The only one that beats him is Sean Connery.I can't wait to see the next Bond film.,positive
une insulte au hold'em...,negative
By far my favorite Bond film of all time. I'm not a huge Bond fan... but this did it for me. I love the action.,positive
"One hell of a Bond movie. Best since GoldenEye, maybe better.",positive
Disappoints and disappoints big big time.....movie is very confusing and drags at places....,negative
At the first glance I thought a blond James Bond would be a 100% failure but as the story goes on I can't wait to see the next james bond movie featuring Daniel Craig !,positive
"Amazing Bond Movie, Fresh new action and actor. Smart script. Best Bond of the last 30 years !",positive
Best bBnd since Goldeneye and probably better.,positive
Welcome back Mr. Bond,positive
Not actually james bond type movie.. but a good one,negative
"For a James Bond movie, it is good. Daniel Craig plays a great Bond.",positive
Daniel Craig IS Bond,positive
Can't stand Eva Green's accent. He's worth the 3hours though...,negative
The only James Bond flick I actually enjoyed watching... Amazing locations,positive
"I was impressed, considering I hated most Bond films.",positive
"I didn't think i would like it, but i was surprized on how good it was",positive
bond james bond...:D:D:D generally i dont like James Bond series but this is diffrent because of HOLD'EM tournament all things are up the Mr.Bond's chance but no one lives forever dont forget it Bond,positive
A dark and sensitive Bond flick? They should have tried this years ago.,positive
"Amazing. Daniel Craig is the hottest Bond ever. I hate the girl in this, but I got over it. Loved the story and omg the cars!",positive
"Slow in parts, the ending surprised me. My favorite part is in the beginning where they are jumping across buildings.",negative
A triumphant debut for Daniel Craig and one of the best of the series.,positive
The Best James Bond Film Ever made,positive
"Kind of hard to follow, especially near the end. I miss Pierce Brosnan.",negative
"Sure, itÂ´s a good action.But it is not a Bond movie. To many errors in the movie that just doesnÂ´t make it a Bond movie. Have you seen the other Bond movies more than 20 times, then you know!!",negative
"Better than I thought it would be ie not as masogynistic plus Mads & beautiful travel shots - Venice, the Bahamas, Lake Como...",negative
"This is the 2nd best Bond movie I've seen. It couldn't beat Goldeneye, though. I hope they remake all the old ones. Daniel Craig makes a great bond.",positive
"A pretty damn good movie, I might like it better than goldfinger, because it brought a seriousness back to the series, as well as portraying bond in a smart clever way the way Ian Fleming imagined him. Great opening, also.",positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond yet!,positive
"EXCELLENT MOVIE !!! Loved it !!! Daniel Craig is my favourite Bond by far, I hope he stays Bond for a while !!!",positive
"Sheer entertainment, from beginning to end. I never liked any Bond movies, until this one.",positive
"It's hard to say Daniel Craig is the best James Bond, but he certainly is a nominee.",positive
"One of my favorite films of 2006. Well crafted and well acted by Craig, Mikkelsen and Eva Green. Arguably the Best Bond film since ""Goldeneye.""",positive
"Doesn't get near to the real ones, but certainly better than Brosnan.",negative
"The best Bond movie in years, maybe decades.",positive
I just love James Bond movies full of action. I love he wore the little blue swim shorts NICE!!! ;),positive
"A great film, although it lacked the humour of previous classic Bond movies. I didn't think Craig would pull it off but I was happy to be proved wrong.",negative
"James Bond is finally good again. Sexy, action-packed, and SMART. If your mind isn't blown by the opening chase scene, you clearly hate action movies.",positive
a nice surprise. Eva Green is yummy,negative
"Really fun story of Bond's beginnings! there's an actual story and not just nonsense one-liners. The bit about falling in love got a little much, but the dialogue on the train with Vesper is great!",negative
"Daniel Craig fits the bond persona well, this was just a crappy movie",negative
I always sleep when i watch a james bond movie but this... is the best of james bond I saw this movie 3 times,positive
"definitely a different style of Bond, but enjoyable as action",negative
One of the best bond films to date. Reserved action (for the series) and rich character development.,positive
I like the realistic 007 :),positive
"esta pelicala gusta si no te apegas a las anteriores, tenes como si fuera un nuevo 007 sin apegarlo al anterior",positive
The best Bond movie ever. By far. Daniel Craig is super slick. Not greasy slick like Pierce Brosnan.....ach. Tight plot and good action.,positive
"even though daniel craig is gay, it was still awesome",positive
Probably the best Bond adaptation so far....heres awaiting his new one.,positive
"It was a good action movie, but the people are complete idiots. This is the first one (supposively) yet there is incredible technology that surpasses even parts of here. But even looking past that, we will say that they invented the cars and all- he had a frickin CELL PHONE!!!!!! Consider it as Bond's son, and its ok",negative
The best Bond movie since Goldeneye.,positive
Extra half star given for swim trunks,negative
"Sympa, different mais chouette acteur dans son style.",negative
i watch this like once a week. the production value and budget makes me cry.,negative
"I liked this, and I don't like Bond movies.",positive
This is the only james bond movie I have ever enjoyed...,negative
"Absolutely the best of the Bond movies - the character through the years had become a cheap caricature of itself over the years, and it was so refreshing to see James Bond redefined and real. Awesome movie.",positive
best bond ever!! doesn't craig look like poutine?,positive
"A tight, tight, Bond film. Alot like the Bourne Identity but a James Bond film. It dies and ends up becoming a half a movie after the card game. Like Wedding Crashers, starts off awesome, ends up falling apart. Still one of the better Bond movies I've seen in a while.",negative
"Fantastic Bond. And hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.",positive
"Best Bond film ever--no sharks with laserbeams, a cast that can actually act--a genunily good movie..can't wait for Bond 22",positive
The franchise re-invents itself. The king is dead. Long live the king.,positive
"I think this was the best Bond movie ever! It made James Bond look real and believable. I loved the stunts and action. Daniel Craig's potrayal of Bond is fantastic, i can't wait to see whats in store next from the 007 franchise",positive
Best Bond Ever!! He falls in love,positive
craig is bond. plays him just like its written in the book. best bond by far!,positive
"The only good Bond film, FACT.",positive
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT.",positive
Daniel Craig is the Best Bond yet...,positive
I thought Daniel Craig made a great Bond---sexy (but not a pretty boy) and tough!,positive
"Far and away the best Bond flick. Sadly, still has some cheesy parts.",positive
great opening action sequence. I think this was long and boring and drawn out too much. He is much better than Pierce Brosnan but definitely no sean connery.,negative
"Bond as he should be: intense, brutal, cosmopolitan, and unshakeably self-assured, with just the tiniest chink in his armour. Daniel Craig's easily the best Bond since the young Connery -- and who knows, Craig may even turn out to be even better given time (yes, he really is that well-cast, footballer's hair-cut notwithstanding). and there's everything else a Bond film should have, too: exotic scenery, a casino full of gazillionaire-types and enough diamonds to MacGyver a chandelier, a few boats, Richard Branson proving that there's not really anything money can't buy, heavy drinking, expensive things blowing up, clever-but-not-gratuitous gadgets (:::cough::: Brosnan-era-Bond :::cough:::), fisticuffs, poisoning, guns, torture... what more could a girl ask for, really?",positive
"he's back, hes brilliant and funny!",positive
one of the best bonds,positive
"Yks parhaista Bondeista. Hyvin yhdistetty leffan aikaan ""muodissa"" ollu pokeriki lefaan...",positive
"Paras Bondi, niin roolisuoritus kun muutenkin. Ainoa miinus on se uintikohtaus jos craigin korvat...no joo.",positive
In my opinion the best bond film ever although i do still have a soft spot for Sean Connery as Bond too :o),positive
"The best of the Bond movies, alot grittier and more realistic than those that preceded it (especially Die Another Day which was stupid) Really shows the origins of Bond, and why he turns out the way he does. Knew Craig would be a good Bond after seeing Layer Cake. The Casino bits drag on a little but other than that, blinding.. good theme tune too",positive
"After so many blah Pierce Brosnan films, I was very suspicious of Daniel Craig. He actually makes a wonderful James Bond and the story surprised me!",positive
One of my favorites. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery. Amazing!,positive
Daniel Craig is an awesome Bond and has successfully revived the 007 franchise with this action-packed blockbuster.,positive
The best James Bond movie I've ever seen.,negative
"I know it's an 'origin story' of sorts and not the typical Bond movie, but something about it left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't doubt Daniel Craig's acting ability - I'm just not fully convinced that he makes a good Bond. Yet.",negative
"Best Bond moie, it's also a fresh new start to the franchise, it's different but it still has the James Bond feel to it. Daniel Craig is a great James Bond, this is a fantastic movie and I look forward to Skyfall.",positive
Not so much eye candy but fun chase scene and good plot twists.,negative
"The Best Bond since Sean, need I say more?",positive
"First James Bond movie I;ve ever seen, but I'd watch more if they were all like this. Surprisingly human characters, and absolutely believable in their roles.",positive
"Hard to top the great Sean Connery, but Daniel Craig just owns the last couple Bond actors. The action is unstoppable in this one.",positive
Daniel Craig is yummy.,positive
BEST BOND MOVIE EVER!,positive
Great action but the ending was really drawn out.,negative
"amazing new bond movie, daniel craig was impressive as the new bond.",positive
I completely changed my mind about older men after seeing Daniel Craig. Yum yum.,positive
"The best Bond movie, ever.",positive
Out with the old Bond and in with the new. Daniel Craig may learn to regret ever taking this role for fear of type-casting. He is perfectly cold and cool as any blunt object should be. Hard-hitting and it never stops moving from the first frame to the last. The free running sequence alone is worth the price of admission. I must get his writer. Best Bond lines I have ever heard.,positive
"a great bond remake, i thought it would suck once they started playing poker but it didn't",positive
"Daniel Craig is james bond. Hands down its a fantastic film, even if it wasnt a james bond movie it would have been a great movie. The longest bond film of all time, it has moments of pure action joy as well as tear jerker moments. The cast was incredible, Paul Haggis (crash) wrote a great story to really complement a rebirth of this once great francise. Seriously Die Another Day was just awful, and I really wanted a new better bond. This film will change the way you view how action should be done, smart, well acted, compelling charecters and story. The spent time and money to ensure that is was at heart a great well acted story like james bond is supposed to be, not a crappy gadget fest. Never has realism made me so happy, he gets cut and bleeds amazing! You must see this film if you like action, story, or just bond, james bond.",positive
The best Bond movie!,positive
"He bleeds, he cries, and he almost dies. Daniel Craig has brought reality into James Bond.",positive
"Daniel Craig, Eva Green pour le lifting le plus rÃ©ussi de 007. Enorme et jouissif",positive
best bond movi i have seen,positive
What is it about bad guys?,positive
"Daniel Craig makes the best James Bond since Sean Connery, maybe the best ever.",positive
Breathed new life into the Bond series. It caught me off guard and I really liked it.,positive
this movie was good..,negative
This is not classic james bond..but its ok.,negative
A good movie just not good bond movie,positive
"It's good to see Bond as a bad ass, but still just way too ridiculous.",negative
"this movie was friken awsome. i love it, i love it, i love it..... this is the best james bond movie ever.",positive
My favorite James Bond movie. Daniel Craig is James Bond,positive
This is a pretty neat action movie. This is a classic Bond movie. NOT!!!,negative
Took a long time to end but it was good overall,negative
"Pleasantly surprised, they finally dragged James Bond into the 21st Century!!!!!",positive
sony ericsson rules :P,negative
"Almost the perfect action movie - great hero (Daniel Craig makes such a good Bond), strong female character, and creepy villain. Loved it!",positive
O..friggin M.. friggin G!! Daniel Craig is the most amazing specimen ever... ever.. A whole new Bond.. with feelings andit just makes him hotter,positive
"I wanted more of the first 10 minutes and instead I found myself growing increasingly bored with a rather unintelligible plot-line. If you have the choice, choose Bourne over Bond.",negative
"A pure Bond. Okay everyone, its true. The legend has returned.",positive
"I won't diss this one too much cuz i love James Bond, and i think Daniel did a great job. The plot, however, let me down big time! At times, i wasn't sure if i was watching a James Bond movie or just another action flick! Shame! Let's hope the next one's better!",negative
"amazing and faithful adaption to Ian Fleming's original Bond novel. Craig fits perfectly for what the character of James Bond was and is supposed to be. Stunningly shot and orchestrated, possibly making this the best Bond of the 21 movies to date!",positive
Awesome! Best Bond film Yet.,positive
"James bond movie were crap.. People watched them just because it was james bond. This one is diferent.. A very, very good movie that redefines what a James Bond is.",positive
Best Bond Ever???? Wears you out just watching! Fantastic,positive
A good movie. Less of the silliness of Brosnan and Moore. Also liked the absence of the fictional Q. Craig plays bond the way he should be - the cutsey Bonds were getting tiresome.,negative
"Excellent Bond movie except for...what? He falls in love? I'll give them the fact that it's the prequel to everything, especially since he seemed to become the Bond we know and love at the end.",positive
"The 21st (official) James Bond film is also one of the best. Daniel Craig is bad ass and more rooted in reality which makes for a better film and still delivers in over the top action, however more believably.",positive
"Except for the extended finale, a really good Bond adaptation. I was all set to hate Daniel Craig as Bond--and he does have a different take on the role--but I thought he did well. Eva Green as the love interest is sensational!",positive
daniel craig (and martin campbell and stuart baird) saved the franchise.,negative
Funniest torture scene of all time,positive
"The best James Bond ever. The darkest one. I didn't want to see another James Bond after Pierce Brosnan. Daniel Craig gave it a new dimension, far better.",positive
"love it!!! all action, love daniel craig as bond!!!",positive
They emphasized so much on the car during the atvertisments and all but the car blew up the second time bond used it....i expected to see more speed...,negative
Brilliant back to basic revamp for the 00's - by the time Daniel Craig hangs up his Walpher PPK - the people will be moaning that the next Bond is not blonde enough.,positive
Much better than I expected,positive
James Bond just got cool again!!!,positive
"Didnt think he'd be a very good Bond, but i'd say he's one of the better ones, very gud film",positive
"Superb, incredible! Ending could've been polished up a bit more though...",positive
gritty action sequences. crisp screenplay.,negative
The Pierce Brosnan Bond was great but Jason Bourne emerged as a new action hero with a gritty edge. Daniel Craigs Bond seems like the pint of lager rather than the shaken not stirred martini Bond of old. The film deliberately upsets some of the old clichÃ©s and is all the better for it and looks like it could spawn a good franchise as long as there are good scripts out there.,positive
The best bond to date!! can actually kick proper ass without the gadgets!,positive
"Did not think I would accept Daniel Craig as 007 but after seeing it, I was blown away. The best physical bond to me!",positive
one of the best James Bond films made!!!!,positive
"""The name's Bond... James Bond.""",positive
"Typical James Bond, and that's a good thing.",positive
The best BOND movie! Daniel Craig is superb!,positive
"Amazing and innovative, can't wait for the next installment.",positive
Now I'm finally convinced James Bond IS a tough guy ;-),positive
"Having grown up watching Remington Steel aka Pierce Brosnon carry out his assignments with the aid of his gadgets, charm and good looks, the Daniel Craig James Bond proved to be the real thing. His inflated ego, skillful hands, emotional insecurities, tight butt and arrogant style with women made him the heartless killing machine, that was Bond.",negative
"best 007 movie of all of them, Daniel Craig is the best James Bond",positive
DA BEST BOND FILM SINCE GOLDFINGER! SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS ROGER MOORE!,positive
"JUST got this from Netflix, it's a good one! Probably my favorite Bond movie because it's not so much like the others. Bond is much more flawed, and I like that...I also don't mind staring at Daniel Craig for two hours.",positive
"Daniel Craig does a great job filling the shoes of 007. His portrayal is along the lines of a Han Solo character; a rough and tumble, shoot you under the table type of Bond.",positive
Talk about the one that brought 007 back from the brink. Daniel Craig totally hits this one out of the park. Yay!,positive
"Good Bond flick, but it's nothing more, nothing less.",positive
"Best Bond movie since Roger Moore, maybe even since Connery.",positive
"One of the longest movies out there. This movie was alright, but it was just way too long. I never thought this friken movie would EVER end. The plot was interesting, and there was a good amount of action in there too.",negative
LOVED it. It was darker and more realistic than the more recent Bond movies.,positive
"La mejor que he visto de esta saga, es muy entretenida y se ve un James Bond mÃ¡s vulnerable y humano.",negative
Sweet Bond film. Vesper was smokin,positive
"somewhat complex plot at points, but absolutely loved it... fantastic action...",positive
"this movie is what Bond movies should have been, no crappy ""dr no"" and no crappy Sean Connery, ugh what a crappy Bond he was.",positive
The best James Bond so far. I never thought Connery could be out done but Daniel Craig does the job right!,positive
"the best bond film along with Goldfinger. This is a film of searing action set-pieces, drama like action, and brings excitement back to a film series that was descending into a stupid parody of itself. It needed a dose of seriousness and REAL cool. Boy did it get it. A much better film than the Bourne Supremacy which is a run-of-the-mill story that is almost by the numbers in its plot turns and 'twists'... good bridge scene... and little else. I prefer CR. Great female lead too... Yes, I do go a bit weak for deep black brunettes (majorly) but holy cow the bond 'girl' is more beautiful out of make-up than in. She is smart, witty, endearing, vulnerable yet strong. Fuckingg ood job by Martin Campbell who made the best Brosnan Bond film - Goldeneye. Very, very solid. 'Slow' middle through the poker game (apparently) - but only if you are a moron.",positive
"Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond in this ""reboot"" of the 007 series. The movie is much more earthy and gritty than some of the Pierce Bronsan movies, but still retains all that makes the series great.",positive
By far the best Bond film to date. A must see action thriller.,positive
"Best Bond since Connery and best Bond movie since early Connery, top rated!",positive
At last! A Bond in the tradition of the original before it became so campy.,positive
Can you say hell mothafuckin yeah?,negative
daniel craig is the most exciting bond in years ... and the aston martin ???!!!,negative
"Wow... So they can go back and re-do all the bond movies with this same grit, edge and style and it will be fresh all over again!",positive
Bond at its best. Craig was perfect for the role. Glad to see new life breathed into a flailing franchise.,positive
"This James Bond has upgrads to HITMAN, no more nice and charming ladies' man. Get the things done, that's what our tax dollars for Government Agents...hahaa!",positive
"Definitely one of the best Bond movies. Convincing acting, storyline, and development of the Bond character.",positive
ok but could ge better,negative
The best Bond-movie I've ever seen.,positive
"Great film,a new bond making a good first impression with a new rougher less refined type of bond plus the car looks amazing",positive
Nuuu not Daniel Craig >-<,negative
...Best bond ever!!!!!!,positive
"This, for me, is the most sophisticated Bond movie yet. It doesn't spoon feed the narrative to you. Oh, and the action is great.",positive
Outstanding reboot of the Bond franchise. I'm a big fan of the old bonds (including Pierce Brosnan). But this is far more like the original character of Bond in the books. Stylish and edgy and thoroughly enjoyable romp.,positive
"Oh er Daniel Craig, cool car, great wardrobe and fantastic body! Who said Bond movies were not for chicks!!",positive
Just you watch. I'm the next Bond. I'd do Craig.,positive
Best James Bond movie ever...,positive
James Bond is back !,positive
"Craig is a good bond. I had my doubts, but he really is perfect for the role.",negative
Daniel Craig a son meilleur!!!!,positive
J'adore l'Aston Martin dans ce film,positive
the best bond film ever,positive
"If Ian Fleming was alive, he would have been so proud. For me, this is the Bond from the books. His arrogance, his madness..pure Fleming. Very close to the book too. Was really suprised they kept the ball beating sequence in! It was a carpet beater in the book!",positive
I have seen it twice but can't remember what's it about...?,negative
Bond is finally a BRUTISH WORKERCLASS MALE,positive
"Best Bond film since Connery left the series. The writing was better. And unlike Brosnan, they found a Bond who actually could show no feeling and look natural while doing it.",positive
"I watched this because I didn't have any other movies around I hadn't seen. I was pleasantly surprised to like this movie. Casino Royale humanizes the Bond character, making him more than a shallow ideal. Instead of just cool gadgets, sexy girls, and crazy action scenes, we get an interesting plot with realistic characters and relationships, complicated situations, and still, plenty of crazy action scenes. Best Bond ever.",positive
Maybe the best bond movie ever.,positive
"They couldn't have picked better actors to portray the characters. No big names this time. Judi Dench returns as M again, but this time gives us her best performance yet. Eva Green brings us a remarkable Bond girl in the form of Vesper Lynd. A Bond girl like Vesper hasn't been seen in a Bond film in years. Mads Mikkelson plays a sinister villain and looks completely like the part. Although Felix Leiter has a small amount of screen time, Jeffrey Wright gave the viewer one of the better versions of the character. Although the story may sound boring, it is actually very exciting and fun to see with a lot of action, with many highlights, which make it too hard to choose the best one. If it's not the chase along the crane, then its tanker at Miami airport or the fight on the staircase. So many possibilities. If you could only choose one Bond film to watch, then this is it.",positive
"""I'm sorry. That last hand... it nearly killed me.""",positive
"d'habitude, j'aime pas James Bond, mais lÃ , c'est carrÃ©ment trop bon!",positive
"What an action packed movie, something for everyone. The opening scenes had my son on the edge of his seat. Very nicely played by Daniel Craig, perhaps how Bond should have been depicted right from the start. Glad to hear he's in the seat again for the final Bond movie.",negative
"He did not fit the Bond-type at first, but he did not disappoint in this movie.",positive
Daniel Craig definitely has the right stuff!,negative
well.. another Bond movie.. but this time at least Bond is humanly possible!,positive
I have to start out by saying I'm not a James Bond fan. I give it half a star because he showed some humanity and made be believe a little.,negative
probably the best 007 movie so far!!!,positive
"Oh My God, I'm in love with Bond all over again. This movie's a TAD long but is a great thrill ride for everybody.",positive
"The best Bond film to date. Its dark, gritty and doesn't pull any shit.",positive
"Daniel Craig is soooo wooden as Bond, I was disappointed.",negative
Leparcour og Daniel Craig......hot stuff,negative
disappointing...is this a Bond movie or a freakin' love story? Daniel Craig looks like a hobbit without all the body hair.,negative
no me gusta el nuevo james bond,negative
Un des meilleurs James Bond !,positive
Probably the best bond film so far. Daniel Craig is such a good actor,positive
Probably the best bond film so far. Daniel Craig is such a good actor,positive
"My favorite Bond so far. He seems a ""little"" more real than all the previous bonds. A Bond I can realy identify with.",positive
"The moment the precredit sequence rolls, you'll immediately realise that Casino Royale marks an entirely new era in the Bond franchise. By stripping away all the cartoonish visual gimmicks (lasers, remote control BMW, cheesey credit sequece silloutes etc.) and injecting more realism into the story, Bond is successfully reinvented for a whole new generation.",positive
my new favorite bond movie!,positive
"Finally, a Bond with human flaws.",positive
"actually, a lot better than expected! best jb in years..",negative
"I really didn't think that Daniel Craig could pull it off, but I was so wrong! 007 just got a whole lot better!",positive
Lugnt den bÃ¤sta Bond-film pÃ¥ senare tid. Craig Ã¤r i jÃ¤mfÃ¶relse med Pierce en bÃ¤ttre Bond. Och jag ser fram med stor fÃ¶rvÃ¤ntning till nÃ¤sta Bond-rulle. Bond Ã¤r lika sjÃ¤lvklart som krossad tomat i kÃ¶ttfÃ¤rssÃ¥sen.,negative
Best James Bond (I haven't seen the Connery ones) yet.,positive
Very good Bond film. I love the opening chase scene.,positive
"what a nice jame bond, the entrance music is pretty cool",positive
was a good release for bond series.,positive
"Never been much of a bondfan after like, timothy dalton was introduced.",negative
Hooray! the Broccoli regime didn't ruin the new Bond!!,positive
"Craig, Mr. Craig Makes a brilliant bond. He brings back the light-hearted and cocky nature that bond lost in his later years. Well played, Mr. Bond.",positive
This is a movie that I could watch again. Most Bond movies are one time only.,positive
"Daniel Craig est a la hauteur du rôle, mais ce n'est pas le meilleur des James Bond",negative
ohhh daniel criag! you can be my 007 any time! wonderful job.,positive
"bondeissa normaalisti oltu siistejä, tässä bondissa kuitenkin näytetään enemmän kuin tarvis, turhaa sitä tekoverta nyt tuhlata kun kaikki varmasti ymmärtää ilmankin..muuten perus bondimaista",negative
"There are two things that make a movie great: first, the writing; and second, the acting. And it took both to bring Bond back into reality. After poor writing and acting in the previous three films, United Artist and Babara Broccoli went back to Martin Campbell to direct. He already revived the Bond franchise with ""Goldeneye,"" bringing Bond to the 21st Century. There were many concerns at first, one, rewriting the introductory Ian Fleming novel; and two, who to play Bond, since they couldn't bring Pierce back into an introductory role. I think we can all agree that the adaptation from book to film was fanatstic. Of course, a background needed to be written first, since the novel is mainly Bond at the Casino Royale. My only pet peeve would be the change from Baccarat to poker, but what can I say, poker has become a hot game as of late. Finally, it was clear that Craig was the right cast. He brings a much darker and reckless Bond who constantly has to battle his lack of experience and ego. Many believed he would tank, but everyone said the same about Connery when Dr. No was in production. And I think we all know how he turned out...! I can't wait to see Craig in Bond 22, the first James Bond sequel...entriguing, no?!",positive
I've never been more pleased with a 007 movie,positive
"I liked the pre-Bond Bond. Gritty and violent, it reminded me of the Borne series. One of my favorite Bond movies yet.",positive
I love this new bond.,positive
Best of the recent Bond films.. Daniel Craig makes Pierce Bronson look like a nancy boy,positive
Daniel Craig= my hero,positive
"Just how I like my Bond...ruthless, reckless, intense, gritty.",positive
"A new continuity proves to be just what 007 needed! Craig turns Bond into a deadly, suave, brutally ruthless spy out to thwart a terrorist?s stock broker. Bond hasn?t been this cool since the 1960s.",positive
~~ReaLLy GoOd MoViE AnD GoOd AcTiOn~~,positive
"thank god daniel craig was the new bond, i can't take anymore dalton's or brosnan's, they were really terrible bonds, craig reminds me a lot of the classic connery type bond, he absolutely smashes the part, great overall movie",positive
"The last Bond film to be based off an Ian Fleming novel came out in 1977. The rest have either been creations of others or merely based off his short stories. How refreshing to see a grittier Bond, who doesn't have grapple hook-dental floss, or can take out a man with a single, random blow. This is, to me, the best Bond movie. It has redeemed the series in a big way. Thank God it felt like he was spying, at least, having to figure out passwords, going into his boss's PC, checking out Vesper's PDA/Phone, etc. It felt like he was doing his job, not just walking from one action scene into another. A new favorite.",positive
Best Bond film I've ever seen,negative
"Great prologue. Awesome opening titles, featuring the theme performed by Chris Cornell (Soundgarden). Cool action scenes. New and younger Bond who can look more physically believable in the role. All these are the ingredients for a brilliant fucking movie! Looking forward to more Bond movies featuring Daniel Craig, next Bond for life!!!",positive
my favorite james bond movie by a longshot. a lot better than anything pierce brosnan or any other bond did,positive
"First of all, Daniel Craig is not bad at all ! He's an ice cold, ruthless killer and looks like James Bond too. What he lacks, is sort of emotional presence. He fills the screen physically, but in other than action scenes he's just kind of...there. Still, Craig is supercool compared to Mads Mikkelsen and Eva Green, who are like the lamest co-stars in James Bond history. Geez, I just got over the fact M is a woman and now you hit me with Mr. Rubberface?? During the whole movie this guy looks like he's just eaten bad fish. And Eva Green is just.. irrelevant as hell. When story is rather boring and dialogue stiff, only thing left is the action scenes. But they are fucking amazing, they really are. I loved the chase at the beginning so much I looped it and watched it nine times in a row. With decent story and supporting cast this movie would have been so much more.",negative
Favortie action movie :),positive
"very entertaining, i cant get over that torture scene.. ouch.",positive
"Well, besides the 9/11 reference, it was a really good Bond movie.",positive
Daniel Craig was a great choice for Bond...really enjoyed it!,positive
Perfect Mr Bond. An action packed movie with lots of explosions and typical bond charm. As i stand i do love a good poker game and that added to the benefit of the whole experience. With Daniel Craig playing the new bond he fit the role well and wowed my wife with what seems to be an excellent body.,positive
James Bond rocks! Loved it! We want more!!,positive
The Texas Hold'em did it for me... and Daniel Craig does a great job.,positive
My favorite Bond and my favorite Bond film.,positive
One of the best Bond movies ever. It takes the cake as the most serious and believable without a doubt. Daniel Craig IS Bond. I can't wait for a sequel.,positive
The best Bond movie since Goldeneye; and maybe the best of all. Universally perfect. Daniel Craig is ace. Reminds me a lot of Connery.,positive
"daniel craig is a good, modern day bond but all the mushy stuff just dragged it out a bit & bond doesn't traditionally really do soppy. it's just straight in & out! he has to stick to being an action man....",negative
It was pretty good but James was a little bit too serious on this one.,negative
"""I've got an itch! To the right! AHH, YES! YES! Yes! Now everybody is gonna know that you itched my balls! AHAHAHAHA!"" Craig proves himself an effective, if not dark, Bond in this his first of the series. There's something for most people here: humor, revenge, romance.",positive
This is the best bond flik ever produced. Closest representation of what Bond was supposed to be like when Ian Fleming first created him for the novels.,positive
Great Bond Film - Daniel Craig is great to watch! I am not fan of action but found this good watch on Sunday arvo,negative
Parhain uusista Bondeista.,positive
Best of the Bond movies - hands down.,positive
Should have had Q with some gadgets. Great running scenes.,positive
Craig IS James Bond.,positive
"One of the best 007 movies I have seen in a long time, Daniel Craig play a smooth Bond who is handsome and tough at the same time, I loved the shots of Lake Como and his love interests were very sweet!",positive
"On voit au tout premier abord que ce James Bond sonne clairement la rÃ©volution. Tout dâabord car notre nouveau Bond, Daniel Craig, est un blond, ce qui est plutÃ´t Ã©tonnant. Ensuite parce que Martin Campbell a voulu faire un film rÃ©aliste, loin de certaines scÃ¨nes parodiques prÃ©sentes dans les derniers James Bond. En effet, certaines cascades ne sont pas truquÃ©es, et vous ne verrez jamais James faire du surf avec un couvercle de bolide. Le rÃ©alisateur de Goldeneye a donc dÃ©cidÃ© dâadapter le premier livre de Ian Flemming. Et contrairement a ce que vous pourriez penser, Casino Royale est lâopus qui se rapproche le plus de lâimage que Flemming voulait donner de James Bond. Fini les vannes a deux balles, les costards jamais salis, et tout le tralala quâon connaÃ®t tous. Maintenant, James est un dur, qui aime se battre, qui encaisse les coups, qui apprend la vie, et mÃªme lâamour. Avec son charme indÃ©niable, et ses yeux verts a mystifier les supporters du Stade VÃ©lodrome mÃªme en plein OM-PSG, Eva Green recale sans problÃ¨me toutes les autres James Bond girl sur le banc de touche. Et venons en a Daniel Craig. Je vous avouerai que lorsque jâai appris quâil serait le prochain James Bond dans un journal, alors que câÃ©tait la premiÃ¨re fois de ma vie que je le voyais, jâai vraiment voulu dÃ©chirer le journal. Malheureusement, cette fameuse revue se trouvait en fait dans une salle dâattente et je comptais bien tout de mÃªme aller a ma consultationâ¦ Puis lorsque je suis allÃ© voir lâexcellent Munich, jâai dÃ©couvert Daniel Craig. Et jây ai vu un excellent acteur, avec de la classe, et je me suis excuse mille fois au dieu du septiÃ¨me art. Le fait quâil soit blond nâa aucune importance : Daniel Craig est un grand, trÃ¨s grand acteur, qui nâa plus a faire ses preuves, et qui, on lâespÃ¨re, fera encore une bonne dizaine de James Bondâ¦ Et puis, un peu comme le trÃ¨s bon La Guerre des Mondes, Casino Royale repose en grande partie sur cinq ou six scÃ¨nes, littÃ©ralement a couper le souffle. Si vous pensez quâune course-poursuite mouvementÃ©e Ã§a ne se fait quâen voiture, regardez la premiÃ¨re scÃ¨ne et vous en serez dissuades. En effet, malgrÃ© le fait que Campbell veuille jouer la carte du rÃ©aliste, jamais les scÃ¨nes dâaction des James Bond nâont Ã©tÃ© aussi intensives. Certains pourraient Ãªtre dÃ©Ã§us car cet opus ne fait rien comme les autres, car vous ne verrez pas la sÃ©ance de gadgets, car le mÃ©chant nâest pas infaillible et meurt rapidement et bien dâautres raisons. Mais dâautres se poseront une question : quâest-ce quâun James Bond ? Et ils connaissent la rÃ©ponse : un film. Et avec sa rÃ©plique ultime a vous faire frissoner, Casino Royale en est vraiment un.",positive
Filling James Bond's shoes is one tough job and Daniel Craig just manages to do exactly this. What a superb great start for him as the new Bond. One of the most clever films of the whole series.,positive
"Good movie and revival of the Bond franchise. Was not a fan of Craig taking on the role of Bond, but have to admit he was very good in it. Look forward to the next Bond flick",positive
This has got my favourite pre-title scene of all the Bond movies.,positive
"Not a great Film, but a big step in the right direction from the stupid and cheesy plots of previous bonds. Craig was immense, making Bond the macho, ass kicking, gun toting, cold blooded badass i think he always should have been",negative
What a mess. Did the world really need a deconstructionist Bond movie? Convoluted plot with no real payoff. And a totally unnecessary parkour scene. Still better than anything Pierce Brosnan did.,negative
"What Batman Begins did for the Batman franchise, this did for Bond. Daniel Craig is fantastic.",positive
I thought the 007 scene was dead. I was wrong! 007 is back and is a bit different from the old 007's you might know. Not suggested for conservatives.,positive
Sean Connery or Pierse Brosnan but not Craig,negative
selvom jeg elsker Connery og Brosnan i bondrollen saa er det her fed action,positive
"Well it was sad. ""Trust no one.""",negative
best bond movie ever,positive
Screw all that other crap. This is the way James Bond movies should have been from the start.,positive
amazing. a great new start to the James Bond series.,positive
amazing. a great new start to the James Bond series.,positive
"MY NAME IS BOND, JAMES BOND.",positive
"Good Bond movie, more human. To be frank I did not like Craig before saw this movie, but his performance turned up to be outstanding !",positive
"Amazing, the best bond movie so far. No cheese, no mercy and no unbelievable i must rule the world bad guy. Great music, great action, great script, great acting and the sexist car in history. I still remmeber the embarrsing moment when Daniel Craig was in the sea and my girlfriend let out an audiences grabbing ""PHOAW""! I shall have those muscles one day. But first i'll watch the movie again, right now.",positive
"Sweet, sweet action. Daniel Craig is hot.",positive
"summed up james bond to a t, liked the way ishowed 007 b4 he was ruthless and cold hearted, can you belive it?.. he actually loved sum1!!",positive
Excellent. James Bond is hard again.,positive
This Bond has a less respect for women than any of his predecessors.,positive
The only Bond I'm interested in!,positive
Back to basics - but the original movie with David Niven was also a classic. This was raw entertainment Bond is back,positive
One of the best James Bond movies to date. Daniel Craig is excellent.,positive
"James Bond; o da senin gibin benim gibin insanmis:)) diger filmlerden tanidigimiz James Bond ya kendini fazla kasiyormus ya da Daniel Craig kendinden biseyler katmis James'e. James asik oluyor james aldatiliyor, James tuzaga dusuyor,,, ve daha neler neler.Bence butun bunlar Filmi utopik bir filmden cikarip realistik bir filme bir adim daha yaklastirmis.tabi bu James Bond hayranlarini uzer mi sevindirir mi bilemiyorum ama aksiyon bakimindan 'tomorrow is another day' daha doyurucuydu.izlemeye deger:))",negative
"daniel craig plays bond to perfection a hard act to follow after brosnan, dalton, moore and connery",positive
"Back to a more classic ""Connery"" style Bond",negative
"Perfect Bond movie. To anyone hating on Craig because he's blonde, get over it. By far the best of the Bond movies and the truest to the original idea of Bond set forth by the author, Ian Fleming. Absolutely awesome.",positive
the only james bond movie i actually like because its raw and more believable and daniel craig doesn't look too bad either,positive
"okay, so i was playing super spy munchkin while watching the movie, so i kind of lost track of the plot somewhat...but....overall, it were good, though the scene with the chair and the ball whipping shall make me whinse ever more and cause me to forsake becoming a super spy...",negative
I liked all the action.....,negative
The best bond since Goldeneye. Fact.,positive
one of the best James Bond i think James Bond look more human in this episode lol [actually he always look like a robot],positive
"Better than Pierce's James Bonds, but not that much better. Overated movie, but then again James Bond has to appeal to the masses, and the masses crave this sort of stupid film.",negative
"This is not a typical bond movie. This is not a typical Bond. The cheesy humor of Roger Moore and silly puns of Sean Connery are gone. What's left is a suave thug with genuine feelings for the ""bond girl"" in a slightly brutal movie that actually has some substance. For a bond it's kind of weird, as a movie it is great.",positive
Very good! And now we all know what the double 0's stand for!,negative
"Daniel Craig is the best bond since Connery. The grittiness of Craig's performance is a vast improvement for the series. The story is not quite up to the actor, though. Shame.",negative
Watch n excitment as James Bond plays a high stakes game of slap the jack followed by 52 card pickup.,negative
luv it!! daniel craig is the best bond ever!!,positive
"Thank you, Mr. Craig, for bringing back the Bond franchise.",positive
Much better than all the other bond movies!,negative
"The greatest Bond film ever made, and one of the greatest action movies ever made. Daniel Craig gets the performance so right, it's scary.",positive
Best Bond Movie since Goldeneye,positive
although it has already been said: this one revives a dying character.,positive
On toimintaa ja paras Bondi sit koskaan =),positive
"Good as an action flick, but I am not feelin this 007",positive
Wow! One of the best Bond films to date.,positive
"Very impressed with Daniel Craig he makes a great Bond, Pitty bout the Poor Astom Martin DBS..",positive
Le meilleur James Bond qui fut.,positive
Eva Green! Judi Dench! Daniel Craig! Bond as it was meant to be done,positive
still wish they had chosen someone like denzel washington as bond--even though daniel craig is stellar,positive
"Altough the rhythm is a little too fast, great fun.",positive
ONe of the best bond movies i have seen!,positive
pretty freakin' awesome but could've done w/o all the dreamy stares between vesper and bond,positive
Good film but a slightly long ending!,positive
Unexpectedly brilliant...,positive
"Right up there with ""Goldfinger""!",positive
come on...it's James,positive
James 'Pop' Bond. Daniel Craig is perfect as underground Bond - more real. Points to Eva Green.,positive
"En trois mots, c'est genial!!! les acteurs sont parfaits, on decouvre une eva green taillee pour ce role, un Craig dont on doute un peu au debut mais qui s'affirme comme la releve ideale du costume de 007. Une vingtaine d'episode de boucherie ""classe"", de machisme, et enfin, un casino royal en profondeur. certes, il n'y a plus les supers-gadgets qui faisaient la renommee de 007, mais bon, qu'est ce que l'on aurait pu inventer apres la voiture transparente du precedent opus??? enfin, un james bond pas tout a fait invincible, a qui il arrive de souffrir. c'est limite ""soulageant"" . certainement le premier episode ou il n'y a que 45 secondes de courses de voitures, c'est, et de loin, le meilleur james bond. a part ca, la performance de Eva green, magnifique et tellement differente de toutes ces ........... en bikini. a ne pas manquer!!!",positive
"I awe. Very impressed with the new bond (Daniel Craig) acting wise not to mention the talent he holds in his body...i had to watch the coming out of the sea scene again, then again, then i slow motion, then again and one more time for effect. swoon.",positive
One of the best James Bond and Daniel Craig is doing the role very well,positive
WELCOME BACK MR.BOND,negative
"the BEST bond ever, its dark, its moody, and above all they do the stunts for real again, if you take bond for what the franchise is then you wont be dissapointed, if you really think its real....GET OUT MORE. onwe more thing eva green is the sexiest bong girl yet",positive
Best James Bond interpreter after Sean Connery... very yummie :-)),positive
Bond is back. Raw as he should be.,positive
Best James Bond ever! Finally one that goes with our times,positive
Great restart to the series. James Bond is a lot more prone to mistakes and not the perfect superhero that the later Brosnan movies seemed to depict him as.,positive
Best Bond = Best Bond movie,positive
"I enjoyed this movie a lot. I've seen all the old ones, and the new ones with Pierce Brosnan made me go,. ""Eh."" But this one held my attention and I liked it. I was pissed off, though, that they took that Aston Martin......and wrecked the SHIT out of it though!!!!!!!",positive
"A decent action movie. The love story is far better than the average Bond movie. This 007 doesn't give a damn whether the martini is shaken or stirred, but the formula remains in place and offers little that is interesting.",negative
"Beautifully acted, amazingly shot, incredible Bond flick, and, after the disaster of Timothy Dalton and the utter uselessness of Pierce Brosnan, hopefully a preview of things to come from Mr. Craig.",positive
Bond at his best...'nuff said.,positive
Amazing. A great way to restart the series,positive
The Greatest Bond Ever Would Be An Under Statment.,positive
"Best Bond movie ever,but is seems to be more darker than the other popcorn-movie like installments beforehand and also Daniel Craig is the best bond since Sean Connery",positive
The opening surprise me...I want to say..The first few minutes is such important that it can tell you weather you should sit here or go... I don't really like this Bond....But it's a bit special maybe a kind of more 'real'...Well..the settings are good but the plot is a bit too long...,negative
"I haven't seen any of the other bonds, and considering, I liked it a lot.",negative
best bond movie ever!,positive
Excellent. The best Bond movie after Sean Connery.,positive
"Best James Bond ever, even better is talk of a sequal that follows on!",positive
cos james bond is hot,positive
best 007 movie EVER MADE!!!!,positive
Brought James Bond back in style,positive
"Il a la couille dure, James",negative
"One of, if not THE best Bond ever. IN a tight racewith Goldfinger as my favorite Bond film.",positive
GREAT MOVIE!!! love it,positive
I was never into James Bond till this movie came out and I cant wiat for the next one to be released!!!,positive
"it has Daniel Craig, an Aston Martin & Chris Cornell singing the song - 5 stars isn't enough!!! lol",positive
"The best Bond film ever. Everyone saw Bond as a suave, gadget-wielding super agent. Fact is, he's kind of a rough-around-the-edges, suave but doesn't rely on it, ass-kicking, no gadget, more similar to Jason Bourne than anyone would care to admit, secret agent. It worked better than any portrayal before.",positive
"worst Bond movie ever. It barely qualifies as a Bond film and comes in last behind ""On her Majesty's Secret Service""",negative
The relief of being rid of Brosnan and ridiculous gadgets made this appear better than it was on first viewing. A bit plodding. I still wish they'd set it in the 50s and followed the book.,negative
Brilliant Update of a tired franchise,positive
"This movie effectively made me forget every Bond movie made before it... including the Connery ones, which I never ever thought was possible. What a powerful reboot to a dying franchise on the verge of becoming a sadder parody of itself than Austin Powers.",positive
A new take on Bond - but still quite enjoyable.,positive
"im glad i took time to cool off before i rated this. i went into the theatre expecting a bond movie and left with having just seen a good movie, so i was dissapointed, because it was too good to be bond. though i am a little annoyed with the constant parade of SONY on everything in that movie...",negative
Its really good and excitin,positive
daniel craig is awsome,positive
"Finally, James rocks!!!",negative
Best Bond Movie Yet.,positive
"Daniel Craig is a true Bond just like the books. Awesome scene with the Aston Martin, a new world record was set for this stunt.",positive
Fell in love with Daniel Craig in the movie,positive
"James bond is the best series ever!!!! besides Potter! love daneil craig!! he is a perfect Bond! not too pretty, and VERY manly!!!",positive
oooohhh those blue trunks,negative
The best of the Bond franchise. I hope they keep it up for the sequels.,positive
"To me, this film had everything a bond film shoul dhave, and then some. Far far better than the last several bonds. Best bond ever? Not sure, but definitely among the best.",positive
A great new cut in the James Bond genre.,positive
Pretty sure this is the best ever Bond.,positive
I gave this movie 4 and a half stars because it is most definitely the way a Bond movie should be but it does leave a little bit to be desired at the end...,positive
There was probably 6x as much action as dialogue in this movie. It was a bit much.,negative
in the top5 bond movies ever,positive
this was an excellent remake of a great film.it was fast and entertaining.it held true to the original and i was thrilled to see they finally found the new James Bond.,positive
"I dont do bond, but this was amazing.",positive
L'un des tout meilleur James Bond. Pas forcement d'inventions dingues dans cet opus mais de la sobriete et du magnetisme.,positive
"back to what bond is sposed to be classy and suave, with just that awesome hint of kickarse. could have done without them destroying the aston though",positive
Bond gets revitalised even though Owen should have starred.,positive
"At last, Bond returns, as Bond ought to be.",positive
"noir, violent, et pas vraiment classe... Ce James Bond là déchire...",positive
"Boring, maybe I've grown out of Bond films though",negative
A bien renouvellÃ© le genre des James bond.,negative
"I usually like Bond flicks, but this one didn;t impress me.",negative
Wow! This is how Bond is supposed to be. You can (almost) forget the others,positive
"At first I wasn't so sure about this after all the hype but it has totally grown on me and I now rate it as one of my fave bond movies. If you watch it comparing it to previous Bond films you will be a little disappointed because this is a new type of Bond movie and I think if they continue like this with the next film(s) Daniel Craig will make a great 007. However, I was a little bemused at how little you saw of the Aston Martin and the fact they trashed it was sacrilege!",positive
"Daniel Craig is hot. this movie is excellent. long, but more time to perve i guess.",positive
I fell asleep part way through...but what I saw...could've been better.,negative
Love this movie...i am bond enthusiats,positive
Det her er en ekte mann over fÃ¸rti og han vet Ã¥ leve livet!,positive
Daniel Graig on jotenki hotti =),positive
"yeah, best once since goldeneye",positive
best bond movie ever.,positive
one of my fav bond movies,positive
"Wow. Just wow. The new Bond is simply yummilicious and the story was pretty good, too!",positive
Ahhh Daniel Craig.....,positive
james bond as a brawler,positive
Best Bond movie since the early days of Roger Moore,positive
"Return to form for the Bond franchise. Like a slap in the face to recent Brosnan techno gadget plastic shite. Solid story, involving action. One downer was the length, slightly long. But still the best of recent.",positive
Best Bond in many long years!,positive
"Fantastic! Daniel Craig was the very best choice to revive the dying Bond genre, bringing back the cool of Connery, the grit of Dalton, and the return to actual espionage, instead of the recent rash of ""the world is going to explode and only James Bond can save the day,"" which we came to expect with Brosnan. I can't wait for another.",positive
"A good movie, but not what I expected from a bond film. it was too much poker not enough action. though the action was very good",positive
loved daniel craig's debut as bond,positive
This is Bond meets Bourne.,positive
I like the direction they are headed.Very good.,positive
Oh God I fancy the pants off Daniel Craig :-) He's a damn good actor too. Excellent movie.. wish I was a Bond Girl,positive
he was the best James Bond,positive
"What can you say, a very different Bond indeed. Brings Bond back to the assassin roots that are the heart of being a '00' agent. Looking forward to where they take the franchise next.",positive
I don't see why everyone was so excited for this,negative
Daniel Craig makes a surprisingly good Bond.,positive
Best Bond film to date,positive
the only worthwhile 007 yet!,positive
"One of the best Bond's I've ever seen. Not that much of technical gadgets as usually and unusual that he fell in love with his woman. Seen it in Spanish, want to see it in English/Finnish too...",positive
"Bond is good, shame about the story. Classic Bond in future please.",negative
IMO BEST BOND EVER!!!,negative
"My name is Bond, James Bond :-)",positive
"It's a rawer, tougher, darker James than the suave portrayal by previous Bond actors. Overall, a fresh reboot of the Bond franchise.",positive
"Sorry, I'm no Bond purist, so this was by far my favorite Bond movie to date.",positive
Daniel Craig'in onceki Bond'lardan farkli oldugu kesin. Keske Eva Green'i de Dreamers'daki kadar cok gorseydik. ;)Ama ozellikle filmin basindaki kovalamaca sahnesi ile harika Montenegro ve Venedik goruntuleri bile yeter.,positive
"REALLY good. If you're not a Bond fan already, this will convert you.",positive
"Really good watch it all the time,exciting and GOOD",positive
this movie was terrific.i mean the fighting the running seen at the begining the action hats off to the choreographer. althought most of the movie takes place at a poker table which is a high risk to take because not everyone knows how to play poker they make it work and keep the audience generally entertained.i wish the movie was a little bit shorter but other than that great 007 film.daniel craig is an excellent james bond.,positive
good addition to the 007 saga,negative
"Bond as he is meant to be, the world of killing and espionage isnt glamourous and its at times it harsh, this film and daniel craig portay this perfectly. Bond is back with blast and swift kick to the nuts.",negative
amazing can't wait for the next one,positive
"Brilliant! Best Bond yet... I am was a ""true blue"" Connery fan. Gotta change my mind!",positive
"Gone are Pierce Brosnan's ultra-sleek action scenes. This new Bond is gritty and cool. The action scenes were awesome, though a little unbelievable at times (the prisoner chase scene where both Bond and the prisoner were jumping around like cheetah/monkey hybrids). Overall, awesome movie.",positive
TrÃ©s bon film d'action... mais ce n'est pas un James Bond.,negative
man i love that opening scene,positive
I think James Bond was meant to be played by Daniel Craig.,positive
the only bond movie I've ever watched,negative
THE best James Bond EVER!,positive
They did a great job with this one to reinvigorate the 007 franchise.,positive
Bond lives. The free running at the start is awesome. Excellent prequesl to the other films. Give bond some depth and some balls.,positive
Reinvigorated the Bond franchise by a) getting a Man to do a Man's job b) including some seriously kick-ass action scenes c) using suspense and tension as opposed to cheap jokes and pompous suavery and d) by not sucking.,positive
Daniel Craig pleasantly surprised me!,positive
Best movie of the Bond Franchise!,positive
"one of the best moovies i`ve seen, daniel graig is a perfect bond=)",positive
"Before 007 and before Dr No in the first motion picture from 1962, this is the story that tells you who James Bond really is!",positive
"top movie, loved the car",positive
"its kind of hard to see Craig as Bond at first but then it kind of grows on you when watching the film. the movie does a great job of making Bond more realistic and gritty. this film shows how Bond becomes the man that he is in the previous movies but i prefer Craig's Bond over the others. another thing i liked was blood in the film, the violence was realistic while in the other 007 films when someone gets stabbed, theres no blood.",positive
"For the love of god why do people persist in thinking Roger Moore was good. Craig, the best Bond since Connery. Casino Royale, the best Bond to watch",positive
Daniel Craig in trunks! Yes Please!,positive
Great action movie. There were at least 4 spots where the movie could have ended but it just kept going...got to be a little long.,positive
Roger Moore > Daniel Craig. good film tho,positive
"Albert R. Broccoli's Eon Productions Limited Presents, Daniel Craig as Ian Fleming's James Bond 007 in ""Casino Royale"". Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli reboots how James Bond got his double 0s. A great choice to rehire Martin Campbell again to direct this film as there is a new actor to play Bond and a new life for the character. Although this film has a lot less action scenes and explosions compared with the other films, this story really develops the movie to be all that interesting. Daniel Craig makes his debut as James Bond, but his version is a cold blooded assassin with no hesitations to kill a villan.",positive
THE BEST OF THE NEW BOND MOVIES!,positive
this movie might have quite possibly saved the Bond movie franchise,positive
BLOND? James Bond... BLOND? Est boone.,negative
"i originally saw this movie with a guy. imagine my laughter when THAT scene was on... nah this is a good one, very cool unlike the original which was more like a comedy. my favourite out of the bond franchise...",negative
they brought back the bond that didn't use weapons!,positive
"No offense to Daniel Craig or anything, but I hated him as Bond. I just didn't like the young Bond and they made him blond, damn it! Did not like this movie at all.",negative
"Nice restart to the series. Craig is a more than adequate successor to the franchise. Could shave off about 15 minutes, but otherwise a top notch Bond film.",positive
"Fkn awesome action movie, Daniel Craig is flawless",positive
best james bond in the past few years,positive
Movie was extremely well done. Too bad that I kept falling asleep - thanks to staying up all night! I'll watch it again so I make sure I don't miss anything.,positive
bond redefined! Craig is SUPERB!!!!!!,positive
"Wicked. no space shite, no OTT cars with rockets and lasers, how a Bond film should be. Can't wait for the next one.",positive
Ugh. I hate James Bond.,negative
Great opening scene. And I learned a new technique.,positive
Just about the perfect Bond movie. A shame that it took this long to finally make a good one. Extra props for the fractal suits in the opening credits.,positive
We actually went to a theatre for this one. It was great.,positive
"Deserves to be in the ranks with Goldfinger, From Russia with Love, and Dr. No",positive
daniel craig did an awesome job as james bond...i cant wait for the next ones!,positive
Wie zat er te kakken da Daniel Craig geen James B(l)ond zou kunnen spelen. He proved you wrong!!,positive
Daniel craig is the best james bond since Sean Connery hands down.,positive
One of the best Bond movies.,positive
Quite good. I enjoyed how they moved away from the technology aspect of James Bond a bit and focused more on the action and suspense.,negative
"Fabulous movie. Daniel Craig brought something new to the character that I never expected, but absolutely love.",positive
Great reminder of what it would be like to live as the most exciting man in the world.,negative
Trip to the darker side of Bond,negative
The original Bond is HERE!!! Daniel Craig cannot do it better than Sean Connery!!! THE greatest Bond film EVER!!!,positive
I never doubted daniel craig's ability to play james bond.and he proved all of his critics wrong.he is 2nd only to sean connery in sophistication but daniel's cooler.great script too.,positive
"Brilliant action cinema, in that it has the sense to focus on the character instead of the explosions. Daniel Craig proves what a genuine actor can do with the material (the first decent actor since Connery to play the part) and Eva Green matches him scene for scene. Enough of the traditional Bond fare to please long time fans whilst injecting narrative and cinematic oomph to reimagine the franchise for a much more cinema-literate audience. Oh, and Eva Green is absolutely the most beautiful woman to be saeen in a film. Ever. There, I've said it. I feel better.",positive
SO GENIUS. Just... just watch it.,positive
Perfect in every sense. A great Bond film...finally. It hurts me to say so but Craig may be even better than Sean Connery.,positive
"good movie, one of my favorite bond films. daniel craig did a nice job.",positive
muuten en kyllÃ¤ oikin Bondeja oo kattonu mutta tÃ¤Ã¤ oli kyllÃ¤ ainaki hyvÃ¤,positive
If you love poker an James Bond....,positive
"Really spectacular, brutal, this 21st Bond movie is clearly the best one. Besides, the romance is ""bloody"" beautiful, true... What a nice poker game ! One of my top 5 movie for sure. FAST AS A GUNSHOT",positive
"Enfin, pierce brosman est plus la.",positive
Nice way to reboot the franchise.,positive
1 van de beste Bond films.,positive
Le meilleur Bond depuis bien des annees ! Une franche reussite,positive
Best James Bond so far.,positive
"I'm sorry for those out there that like the old one's, don't get me wrong I do too, but Daniel Craig is my new Fav.. What a badass and damn is he fine, puts Peirce to shame!! : )>",positive
"""Shaken or stirred?"" ""Do I look like I give a shit?!""",positive
"I'm a massive Bond fan (the original films, none of that 'Die another Die' crap), so I think it says alot that I absolutely loved this film. I was scepitcal at first about Craig, but he's perfect for the role. 10 minutes into the film and you just knew this was Bond. Brilliant stuff",positive
"Best Bond since The Living Daylights. Craig is great, and the first Bond since Lazenby to show some emotion.",positive
I like bond movies. Daniel Craig seems to be the best Bond ever. Waiting for the next one in the series.,positive
Absolutely loved it.,positive
Worst Bond movie I've ever seen,negative
Fabulous. A real return to form and if the car chase had been longer - 5 stars.,positive
"Huomattava parannus perusbondeihin, joista en pida lainkaan. Eka, jossa Bond on ehka jopa ihminen. Tarjotaan muutakin kuin sita actionia ja takaa-ajokohtauksia. Ei siltikaan nouse kovin korkeisiin arvosanoihin.",negative
"Ce film culbute completement le mythe James Bond ! J'aimais beaucoup Pierce Brosnan dans le role, mais ce Daniel Craig assure grave dans un registre tout a fait different. Vivement la suite !",negative
a little predicable but overall the most intense Bond I've seen,positive
The best Bond since Connery.,negative
bond is back needs a bit of an edit,positive
Great movie. Say no more.,positive
Paras Bond-elokuva ja loistava toimintaelokuva muutenkin. Onnistui jopa yllattamaankin parissa kohtaa.,positive
"Possibly my favourite ever film. This is Bond how he should have always been. A superb adaptation of the book, in my opinion perfectly brought from the 50s to the present day.",positive
"When I first heard that Daniel Craig was the new Bond, I was not entirely sure what to expect. Then I watched Casino Royale and it instantly became my favorite Bond movie.",positive
"Joda, James Bond er fin han :)",negative
"A masterful reboot to the 007 franchise. They trimmed the fat (gadgets, CGI, non-stop one liners) and gave us the Bond that Ian Fleming had in mind (minus the smoking addiction).",positive
Best Bond movie ever! Daniel Craig brings Bond to a whole new level.,positive
best bond movie yet. daniel craig is basically as good as connery. yep. i said it.,positive
"my favorite james bond by far, i can watch this and it will never get old!",positive
"This was the shittiest Bond movie I have ever seen. It didn't even seem like he was playing Bond. Daniel Craig made it seem as if Bond enjoyed killing. All the previous Bond's at least looked like they were doing it because they had no other choice. The plot also sucked. The attempt to kill Bond, via a drug induced heart-attack...what the fuck? That was the best they could come up with? Just horrible. The only redeemable quality about this movie is the first chase scene...after that, just press stop and return the rental...if you happened to waste your money on it at all.",negative
paras bondi pitkään aikaan,positive
A very classy bond film.,positive
My favorite of the entire Bond franchise. The best bond since Sir Sean Connery.,positive
"Amazing Bond movie, one of the best ever!",positive
"a top notch blockbuster to end 06 I reckon?though, I do think the Third Act really does suffer a bit?",positive
"Ugh , soo disappointing, still better than most Bond movies, but i thought this was supposed to be the best bond movie ever. (nope!!!) it starts out amazing, but quickly fizzels out into a semi entertaining flick.",negative
Daniel Craig.. EW! I hated this movie!,negative
The best 007 movie that I have ever seen. It stayed away from all the rediculous gadgets used in alot of the recent 007s with Pierce Brosnan. But the new James Bond is a far better candidate than Brosnan because he isn't nearly as Cheesy,positive
"The best James Bond movie. Period. First James Bond movie I though: ""Damn! Bond is a real badass!"" Instead of: "" What a precious pretty boy!""",positive
this movie isn't nearly as good for people who don't play poker and/or don't care about poker,negative
Bond is back. great action and plot line...amazing that you can have both in a bond film.,positive
This is the best Bond movie I've seen.,positive
the ending was BAD. it made me cry.,positive
I want the Aston Martin!,positive
"I normally hate action movies, but this one I loved. The plot is absolutely magnificent. I just love how this movie is made.",positive
"quite simply the worst Bond Movie ever. i didnt feel like i Bond Movie and Danial Craig did a awful job of playing james bond, no charm, no smart comments. it doesnt matter if it was his first mission as 007. He sucked. and the nude seen was not needed. If Daniel Craig is the future of Bond i see more really bad movies in the future. Long live Shawn Connery !!",negative
five star gold. daniel craig. ULTRA HOTTIE!,positive
Halfway through this movie I began to wonder whether this was a Bond flick or a love story. This movie was not up to Bond standards.,negative
Daniel Craig is awsume as Bond..,positive
Best james bond yet. If you liked pierce brosnan you'll like this guy even better,positive
Muy buena y cn mucha accion,positive
"He's so hot. =D Oh, and it's also a good movie. lol.",positive
Bond. James Bond. Oh! He is just so tasty.,positive
This is the best Bond movie of all time! Best action movie I've ever seen,positive
"If you like James Bond movies it's a nice change, I really felt this movie was fresh. Good watch if you enjoy Bond. just don't try to connect it to the other movies in any way.",negative
Excellent James Bond movie.,positive
"Great plot, great action. The best bond movie I ahve seen",positive
"Top film can't wait for the next one, all the doubters of daniel craig have been quashed!",positive
"So far my favourite Bond film and Bond to date! Daniel Craig adds real grit to the character that wasn't found in the likes of Sean or Roger (as fantastic as they were). Really refreshing considering the horrid era of Pierce was just before him. Pretty close to the book as well, I think Ian Fleming would be pleased.",positive
Another James Bond movie. Tons of action with a little romance.,positive
Le meilleur James Bond,positive
James Bond reborn. And papa's got a brand new bag. Aow!!,positive
Jag gillar bondfilmerna,negative
"A good Bond, better than the last, not as good and Sir Sean.",positive
In order to enjoy this movie you have to get that whole invulnerable james bond figure that never gets hurt out of your head. In this movie they have gone a different direction with the James Bond character. The first time I saw it I didn't really like it cuz i was expecting that kind of character and movie. When I saw this movie again. I was amazed by how great an action movie this is.,negative
"The best Bond film. It makes it hard to take most of the earlier films seriously. The groan-inducing double-entendres of the past few films are gone, as are most of the gadgets. What remains is the core of the Bond character, and a script that is closer to the source material than even most of the Sean Connery entries.",positive
Good Bond flick for Craig. I liked it.,positive
"I love it, BOND is tough agian",positive
gay! i thought this was going to be like 5000x better,negative
VVG. Daniel Craig shows how it's done. Liked Eva Green too.,positive
yksi parhaista bondeista ever.,negative
Did they expect anyone not to fall asleep during the twenty minutes long poker scene?,negative
"will definitely watch it again, and again. For me this is one of the best 007 movies, Daniel Craig is bloody gorgeous, which helps!! seriously though, good movie, more gritty, less cheesy.",positive
prob the best bond film ive seen,positive
I think if I just say yummy that would do it...,positive
Obviously a great restart to the series. Just what a good Bond movie should be.,positive
How can you go wrong with 007?,positive
james bond de dingue!!!,positive
"Great film, but then again I love ALL Bond films! Can't wait till the next one...",positive
Bond is back! Daniel Graig proved the doubters wrong. I think even Connery would agree that he's a worthy Bond.,positive
The best James Bond. Back to the original. Dark and intense. Even if Sony is too present in the movie....,positive
"Jameksen kunniakas paluu; kovinta leffabondia sitten 60-luvun. Daniel Craig suorastaan ilmiÃ¶mÃ¤inen. Laatusanat loppuvat kesken. No, tÃ¤stÃ¤ ei Bond enÃ¤Ã¤ parane. Vesi kielellÃ¤ odotan seuraavaa.",positive
BBE = best Bond ever!,positive
possibly the best bond film made. the fact that they have dumbed down on the gadgets and made more out of his ability to use his head and fists make this vey different and very good.,positive
"now i know the plot itself is bullshit if the villain was to host the poker game he would've paid off the dealers to rig the game so he'd win if the mi6 bought off the dealers the game would've still been rigged meaning the entire game was pointless. how each players behave doesnt influence the outcome of the game itself as the ending is decided by how much the organization behind the players paid to the dealers, not how each player plays how dissapointing...",negative
Loved it - great for when you need a good action movie. But you'll never look at wicker chairs in the same way again...,positive
hardest bond movie recently made,positive
"Probably the best bond movie, dropped it's half a point because of all the sponsorship deals they had going particularly with sony.. and he is mighty tasty... the shower scene is soooo good.",positive
My Favorite Movie Ever!,positive
"Before this movie i had lost my interest on 007 movies... mostly because of too much tricks and lies... Anyway, this movie is like classic 007 agent movies.",positive
tÃ¤Ã¤ on niitÃ¤ nykypÃ¤ivÃ¤n harvoja bondeja jotka muhun uppos..erittÃ¤in hyvÃ¤..,positive
Uusi Bond aikakausi alkaa!! Realistinen Bond!! Mahtavan intensiivinen alkuflaidis,positive
Daniel Craig is totally a hottie and parkour in a James Bond film was the best idea EVER.,positive
So much better then bonds from Goldeneye,positive
"James Bond a decide de changer de gueule une fois de plus. Pour feter ca, il decide de gaspiller l'argent du contribuable rosebeef en se laissant aller a son addiction favorite : le poker.",negative
Synes at det er den bedste Bond indtil videre..,positive
"With Pierce Brosnan being the most familiar Bond to me, I wasn't sure how I'd find Daniel Craig, but he was excellent.",positive
I am not a fans of Bonds Movies but Craig is super in his little blue shorts. The film itself is good and I like the romance bit. Mr Bond has a heart at last... sad that she died though.,positive
One of the best BondÂ´s He is the best Bond Actor,positive
This is my favorite James Bond,positive
"Were people watching a different movie than me? It's all well and good making a film that looks at Bond as a character but don't then have him flying around like an X-Man and not forming a personality until the 50th minute. Daniel Craig looked uncomfortable throughout, and the script was far too confused for a Bond movie. How can anyone liken this to the fantastic Batman Begins? Casino Royale shouldn't have been a good adaptation of the book, it should have been a good chapter in the movie franchise. It isn't. The film acts more like a bridge to what we'll see in the future. fair enough if we're going to get some great Bond films, but I won't return to this. There are ten better Bond films out there and I doubt Craig will ever make a really good one.",negative
i couldnt like Daniel Craig as 007 James Bond...he's not successful considering the previous Bond's...,negative
"This basically did to James Bond what ""Batman Begins"" did for Batman: restarted the franchise by making the character interesting and relatable.",positive
"Whoa, what a great movie! I loved the fact that it's revamping the James Bond line of movies and there will actually be worth watching to see how the new 007 develops as a person. It was like watching Batman Begins after watching all those other crappy Batman 3 and 4 movies.",positive
Surprisingly th best Bond film ever. And I thought Sean Connery is the *only* Mr. Bond.,positive
YleensÃ¤ Bondit ei sytytÃ¤ suuriin liekkeihin. TÃ¤mÃ¤ sytytti. Erinomaista viihdettÃ¤.,positive
Pretty damn amazing!,positive
Very modern and a great take on the story. Linked well to the book and I feel the level of the films had to be raised if it was going to compete with the Bourne franchise!,positive
"After seeing Casino Royale, I literally cannot go back and watch any of the old Bond films. I have tried, but this one sucks the wind out of all the rest. Here's hoping Daniel Craig's career as 007 continues to be as great as this movie is.",positive
"This movie is by far the very best Bond film sense Sean Connery first established the role. Daniel Craig is incredible, he has Bond pegged. I love the rough and tumbeble fighting, the chase scenes, the lack of innapropriate materiel. My only grumble is the choice of actress to play Vesper Linn. Good acting but not very pretty. But, that's nothing. I can't wait to see Daniel Craig continue his career as Bond, James Bond.",positive
Best Bond Yet! The best reviewed movie of 2006 for a reason.,positive
Probibly the best bond film I've ever seen. Perfectly cast and action scenes that just blow your mind,positive
"Often used to watch the worst films every time I take a bus trip, I expected nothing good about Casino Royale. Not when I saw it announced, not when I heard the new bond was Craig, not even when I saw the trailer and neither then when the film started to be shown at the screen of the bus. But little by little i started to get involved with the story. Yes, the typicall action hollow film: Gadgets, cars, beautiful girls that only know to do bed scenes, explotions, the bad guy who always is ugly or handsome but with a physicall defficience and he'is crazy, the good girl that turns out to be bad... Yes. But I liked the changes, I prefer Daniel Craig as Bond by far than Pierce Brosnan. The change of Bond related with his female relationships might be corny but i liked too. I think it's an entertaining film for not Bond lovers but for the general public.",negative
Flaw: Bond runs too much.,positive
"Some action, suspence, hot girls, the car of course, but it's not the same without Pierce Brosnan",negative
"all bond films are fantastic, but this might be a new era of more edgy bond films",positive
Craig really is an amazing bond,positive
"I fell for him (not literally, c'mon) in this movie, he was amazing.",positive
Bond is drop dead gorgeous!!!,positive
another great James Bond movie after last few crapy years,positive
a great way to revive the Bond empire,positive
"What - Bond falls in love?!?! This was a very different Bond movie but still action packed which was awesome. He had a rougher edge than previous Bonds, but the change was refreshing. The romance was a bit of a stretch to accept, but sexy nonetheless.",negative
"Diving into the heart of James Bond and how he came to be, Casino Royale finds a happy medium: the film is chock full of enough jaw-dropping stunts to astound any action movie-lover, but not so much as to sacrifice a character-driven narrative that people can sink their teeth into without a stale aftertaste.",positive
Poker + Bond = Greatness,positive
"Wanted to dislike this film, but it is undeniably excellent. Bond has grown up with this film, but it does make me wonder whether we will look forward to Bond films like this on over Xmas like we do with the 60's and 70's installments.",positive
"im not gonna lie, i watched this bond movie again the other day and it is one of the best of the series. mostly due to daniel craig.",positive
I think he made a lovely James Bond,positive
Nice return to form.,negative
"With unflinching honesty I can say Iâve never really been a fan of James Bond. The whole package never actually stirred anything up for me about which to care. Goldeneye took a step in the right direction, but the over the top action combined with the gizmos to make it all a shade shy of appealing. With that same honesty in mind, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed Casino Royale. Daniel Craig is undoubtedly the best Bond ever to take the screen. This time around 007 is a fully developed character, completed by the nuances previous films attempt to imply all the while lacking. Craig depicts Bond with the charisma one expects, but also, when necessary, incorporates a quality that makes the character a plausible killer. Eva Green offers the first so-called âBond Girlâ to actually be worth taking note. Early offerings may have provided sexy woman with sass and the occasional spark of intellect, however, Green takes Vesper Lynd to a fully realized dimension much as Craig does for Bond. She easily meets the Bond Girl prerequisite of being exceedingly attractive, though donât be too distracted. This character is more than a match for Bond. She is Bondâs first real equal, in regards to charm and wit, that has ever taken this type of role. Mads Mikkelsen provides a realistic villain which makes his character all the more sinister. Gone are the cliched trappings of some high tech hideout, surrounded by henchmen, and we are left in the company of a man who might pass for any successful business man. Yet there is an ominous element to the man made apparent the moment he steps on screen. Mikkelsen knows when to play the role cool and when to turn up the volume. His portrayal of Le Chiffre never goes too far in either direction which leaves one curious about the character. Of course there is action but donât expect an artillery barrage. Though undeniably fast paced, the action scenes serve more as a reminder that this man, regardless of his facets, is an efficient killer and that lives are at risk. Evenly balanced with scenes that involve genuine talent, which this cast has in spades, the film provides enough drama and intensity to keep any audience at full attention. Wrapped tightly around an engaging story, in-depth characters, and gorgeous scenes from around the globe, Casino Royale finally gives us a fully realized James Bond.",positive
The opening chase scene is probably one of the most intense scenes I have ever watched. Daniel Craig is a badass.,positive
saw it three times in theatres.,positive
"007 will always be a guilty pleasure for me .. the feminist in me rolls her eyes a lot, the rest of me loves it.",negative
Daniel Craig fits the bill perfectly as Bond. Great film.,positive
"My favourite Bond movie, and my favourite Bond.. so glad they got rid of Pierce.. never liked him too much in the role",positive
"Cool, first chase scene! Refreshing change for the Bond series.",negative
Probably the best Bond I've seen. Top notch.,positive
"Not a Bond fan, but this one held my attention for most of it. I think 2 hours is long enough, though.",negative
"Connery, Lazenby, Moore, Dalton and Brosnan eat your heart out. The best Bond by miles. Daniel Craig is so great as Bond. It's official, we love blonde Bond!!!",positive
Redemption for the Bond series.,positive
you know the number? you know the name? le film de 2006,positive
Great movie.. best James Bonds #1 sean connery and #2 daniel craig.,positive
"Best Bond movie since the days of Connery. Bond goes back to his roots and we get to see how 007 became the cold hearted, womanizing bad ass that we all know and love. Flemming would be proud and I'm definitely looking forward to the sequels.",positive
"They call it a reboot of a franchise. I call it a well hit kick up the arse!! This is what James Bond was needing ever so badly. This is a must see. If you were not a fan of Bond before, you will be now, oh yes, you will be.",positive
favorite bond movie and daniel craig is a badass,positive
One day i will be james bond,positive
When's the next movie coming out?,positive
The best James Bond movie.,positive
"Best Bond movie and best Bond by far!! No more cheerful out of shape old guys, but a hardcore killing machine! ""Half-monk, half hit-man""!",positive
"Is this really the best Bond movie in ages like so many people are claiming? Well, yes. But than after the progressively-worse Brosnan thats probably not much of a compliment. For now though, let me say that Craig fits the tux well and besides of from the superflous hour and a half at the beggining of the movie, it's probably the most emotionally fufilling Bond movie since ""On Her Majestys Secret Service"".",negative
Best Bond movie ever. Bond's not a sexual machine in this one. :),positive
Great action and good twists,positive
"I don't care what others think, this was one of the best Bond movies I've ever seen",positive
"One of the best ever... bond took the step in the right direction. Great actor. In the line of the bourne trilogy. Heroics, yet at least somewhat physically possible stuff (unlike die hard etc.)",positive
"It's basically flawless. Certainly, Craig himself is not only the best Bond ever (and by a country mile), but he'd whip all the others combined whilst naked and strapped to a chair. The action sequences are fantastic but it's the quiet bits in between that really make the film. Far more gritty and realistic than before - out goes the stupid camp humour and in comes a flawed, headstrong Bond who doesn't give a fuck about how is Martini is served but will kill you if you look at him a bit funny. He's not really all that pleasant... which was always the point, and the way he was in the original novels. Eva Green and especially Caterina Murino are very easy on the eye. Green excels with her performance, both being Bond's equal and vulnerable enough to hold your attention. Judi Dench is M, and always will be. No silly gadgets - the cars are nice enough, but don't do silly things like go underwater or fly. Outstanding.",positive
I love it. One of the best James Bonds movies I have ever seen.,positive
Best bond ever... not too many drawn out fights but still the great gadgets and cars... everyone should own a copy,positive
"Classic Bond, none of that Pierce Brosnan bs.",positive
"Lovely acting, awesome movie",positive
"Probably the best bond movie well ever. As with the last 3 movies i saw this on the pig screen. It was brilliant, A very good storey line witch you could actually believe for once and long may this partnership continue and if what i read about Bond 22 is right it seems to be following the same winning patten.",positive
Un ottimo James Bond...cattivo al punto giusto!!!,positive
"Bond is a 60's concept and it was showing its age in the 90's. They are flogging a dead horse. Women will rate this movie highly because of the ""look at my pecs i'm coming out of the water"" scene. It's also a bit of a kneejerk reaction to Pierce Brosnan's rendition of Bond which was too crowd pleasing without any integrity whatsoever. Bond died with Timothy Dalton, who was excellent.",negative
"All in all, a pretty good movie. The action scenes were fantastic, especially in the first hour of the movie. Some of the writing seemed a bit cheesy at times - corny lines and weird timing. But I thought that Daniel Craig played a very good Bond.",positive
Daniel Craig is very hot!!!,positive
Le film type qui previent des dangers d'accorder sa confiance a une femme. Merci James.,positive
So hot. Need i say more.,positive
"Very good, sure not to disappoint.",positive
"James Bond is back, and is not Pierce, thankfully. Besides incorrectly assuming Parkour is still all the rage, the film is spot-on warm, gooey, visceral Bond madness. Crispy on the outside, soft and cheesy on the inside, as it should be.",positive
probably my favorite bond movie,positive
"Pretty good. The character of Bond seemed less developed than in the other movies but I blame the script for that, Craig himself shows great potential for the series of films.",positive
You Mean James BLOND,negative
"didn't feel like a james bond movie. i was like, ""eh"" after i saw it.",negative
The shizzle fo cool.,positive
Unexpected but loved it! What's not to love about Daniel Craig?,positive
My favorite bond next to Connery.,positive
"Without all the cartoony shit, you realize that Bond is just kind of a jerk. Sorry, um, a ""soulful"" jerk. And ugly.",negative
"initially wasn't too keen to watch.. Daniel Craig the new bond??? Ok, ok, after watching it, i admit it not tat bad i assumed it will be. but bond falling in love??? errr...",negative
some terrific and original action scenes. thought Craig was a terrific Bond,positive
"One of if not thee best Bond movie to date. Craig is a great new Bond and adds his own style, they all had their own styles so it's hard to compare the great Bonds to one another. I hope they keep making them like this and keep Paul Haggis writing them.",positive
Rather read the book agian.,negative
"This is the first movie made by Sony Pictures, after they acquired the license to Bond. They changed things, and not all for the better. The movie made me almost want to leave after the opening credits, which are out of order compared to most bond films.",negative
"Daniel Craig jumped to the top of the list of best James Bonds immediately after this flick. This also became my favorite Bond film ever. Every action sequence was insane and the supporting cast stood up to Daniel's performance. Not only was this a great Bond film, it was a fantastic action movie.",positive
This is the movie that made me so very want an Aston Martin.,negative
Possibly the best of the Bond movies. I allways thought Bond acted too Suave...,positive
"Peliculoooonnn! Un Bond nuevo y renovado para retirar al pobre Pierce que habia hecho un papelon en la ultima, que fue malisima! Daniel Craig la rompe como un Bond mas oscuro y violento. Super pochoclera y recomendable!",positive
"The James Bond franchise is revamped with the first blonde actor. Daniel Craig plays a brooding, hard-hitting Bond on his first mission tracking a terrorist financier with a love of high-stakes poker.",positive
"The James Bond franchise is revamped with the first blonde actor. Daniel Craig plays a brooding, hard-hitting Bond on his first mission tracking a terrorist financier with a love of high-stakes poker.",positive
"While I used to be able to rank which Bond movie is better then the other, I could never say that any one of them where ""Great"" films. But I can now.",positive
This movie was sooo much better then I thought it would be...cannot wait till the others come out!!!,positive
"The best Bond movie... Never Say Never again was a close second. Finally someone who, though not of the same caliber as Connery, was not as lame as Brosnon.",positive
Best Bond since Connery.. Best Bond film since...Spy Who Loves Me?,positive
Wow...thats seriously all I can honestly say.,positive
"excellent movie, better than the original.",positive
"one of the strongest bond movies, but the gambling scenes are way too long and unexciting.",negative
Best Bond Movie Yet.,positive
"first james bond ive seen, and i iked it!",positive
im not into james bond films but this was a good one full of action,positive
i was sceptical of this new guy but he did a great job,positive
great addition to the bond films,negative
Craig is the best bond. IMO.,negative
"Wow...I thought Sean Connery could never be surpassed as Bond. And I still think he was great, but this movie is incredible. Daniel Craig is exactly what Bond should be, and the crown must be passed.",positive
it was ok for a bond flim but the old bond flims were better,negative
"Awesome!!!! it wasn't as tongue n cheek as the pierce brosnan films, definately a darker Bond!",positive
One of my favorite Bond movies after the Sean Connery era.,positive
"Daniel Craig makes Bond his own and does it in style, less tacky gadgets and more Bond style.",negative
he was looking good in tht speedo,positive
"Could have made a 4, but the shooting up of baddies becomes a bit random in the last act, and, yeah, that twist is a bit dodgy, no? Still, the first Bond flick worth watching for decades.",negative
"Pretty awsome, a little on the long side but well worth it!",positive
the James bong arguement again!! i just like this one for the piss taking,positive
Finally: a hot Bond!,positive
"Best bond in years, and film to that note. Craigis the man, and I hope he stays on for a long long time.",positive
Worse than previous 007 movies,negative
Ive finally watched it and i admit daniel craig makes a good james bond. BUT he's not half as sexy as pierce brosnan or sean connery!,positive
omg ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE,positive
Good to see the Bond franchise shedding the whiz-bangery and getting back to basics.,negative
"Best Bond this side of a reboot. Forget the old movies. This is definitely the most raw, but also the most emotional Bond you'll ever see. Though some of the action-scenes are a bit too long for my taste. It's the dialogue and the chemistry between the characters that drives this movie forward - which is refreshing in a franchise usually bogged down by elaborate gadgetry and way too many one-liners. A Bond-movie that is also a movie in its own right.",negative
A refreshing perspective on the James Bond myth... really kicks Pierce Brosman's arse.,positive
"rauwe actie, spannende poker, coole 007 geen brosnan!, auto's, vrouwen, geld, stereotiepdoorbrekende bond, verrassend, mooie spectaculaire scÃ¨nes, eva green, green green!",positive
"dark, moodey, intelegent, this is the brand new bond and he is better than ever",positive
"Alright... so when Pierce Brosnan announced his retirement form the Bond franchise everyone wondered who would take his place. After a few months, Daniel Craig was chosen. And what a great choice it was. Easily one of the more violent Bond films, ""Casino Royale"" explains how James Bond became 007. Throughout the movie, you can tell that he's still getting used to things and learning who he can or can't trust. But Craig brings a certain realisticness to the character, which makes Bond believeable (no gadgets, no heat-seeking missles on his Aton Martin) as a real human being. Great movie, great acting. Edge-of-your-seat action. Doesn't disapoint.",positive
Oh Dear. Real spying isn't this dull,negative
Best of the bond films.,positive
"James Bond has gadgets and class, this guy is a street fighter, hate it",negative
My favorite James Bond movie...,negative
"Best Bond actor since Connery, good film, not as far fetched as Brosnans efforts.",positive
should of had more of tyrone from snatch in it,positive

Much better than expected.,positive
BEST BOND 4 YEARS!!!,negative
"Best bond film since Goldeneye, brilliant from start to finish.",positive
"Not necessarily best of bond series, but loved the parkour scene, and it's a Bond after all!",positive
"Not the usual Bond 'fix' but worked realy well. And oh yeah, Eva Green's fit as foook!",positive
Den fedeste 007 der er lavet! OG den bedste James Bond,positive
What can I say..........................Daniel Craig mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,positive
"One of the best bond films of recent times. It may not have the gadgets, but it has something that all previous Bond films don't have - Acting. The action sequences are great",positive
the best of all Bonds from far!,positive

"Vaalea Bond toimii sittenkin, ja parhaiten kuin kukaan aikasempi Bond :D Paras 007-leffa ikinÃ¤!",positive
"Horrible waste of time. Did you see the trailer? Great, enjoy that - a well-constructed, pulse-pounding demo reel that revealed any cool action sequence you would have wanted to see, plus you saved some cash. The ludicrous relationships and motivations completely disconnected me from the film. Too bad this franchise is being milked into the ground and still takes itself seriously.",negative
Thank god somebody saved the Bond franchise,positive
Best Bond movie yet!,positive
He makes a pretty cool Bond,positive
I must say this is one of the better James bond flicks.. I liked Daniel Craig as bond....,negative
"Fantastic! I was skeptical about Daniel Craig as 007, but he is amazing in this role. I am a HUGE, HUGE Bond fan and I was very impressed with this film. It is definitely one of the best.",positive
I was really happy they took the Bond character back to his book orgins. Daniel Craig did an awesome job playing Bond,positive
A dynamic movie that shows the most raw and unrefined James Bond during the early days of finally getting his 00-agent status.,positive
"Un autre film de James Bond, trÃ¨s bon puisque l'intrigue vient de Fleming lui-mÃªme. Dommage cependant qu'ils aient retirÃ© Pierce Brosnan.",positive
"Perfect choice for the new Bond. Loved the movie, true Bond style",positive
"A far more gritty and true portrayal of the James Bond in Ian Fleming's novels. Drags in the middle, but that makes sense since the entire middle is a card game...",positive
"Woo-hoo! Finally a modern Bond film that can be compared favorably with the classic Connery movies. Craig gives us a much more hard-bitten Bond, and in a big switch from the last 20 years of the series, he actually screws up badly at one point. It's ever so much more interesting to see the character overcome legitimate obstacles than to watch him smugly solving every single problem with unruffled aplomb.",positive
Daniel Craig makes a great 007,negative
The best Bond movie by far,positive
"Basically the best Bond movie ever. Craig may even be better than Connery (don't hate me for saying that). The action was amazing, as was the story. Crash sequence was great, and, well, the whole movie was.",positive
"Out of all the Bond films, this one stacks up as the best yet. Pierce who?",positive
Bravely reinvents a tired franchise. Daniel Craig was made to play Bond.,positive
Boring. It'll take some time to get used to Craig as Bond...,negative
Almost perfect. Would it have been better with gadgets though?? Not sure but bring back the gadgets!! Great Movie nonetheless.,positive
Just ok. I'm not thrilled but I loved the cinematography. There are some better Bond movies there.,negative
En af de bedste Bond-film - og blaeret at der er hele 2 danskere med!,positive
"it's absolutely fabulous, especially the shower scene. Is it the first time ever when Bond didn't hook up with a girl in such a situation or am i missing sth?",positive
Best.Bond.Movie.Ever.,positive
This James Bond blows,negative
"Best Bond movie yet, 007 retains his dignity. Best ever, no. If they combine this new style with an even better plot they'll have a masterpiece. Great new directions, nice to have a movie about the man, not the gear...",positive
"Bond is BEAST! The modern Bond does not use his suave/debonair to get what he wants, he uses his FISTS! Campbell/Craig breathes life back into the stale 007 franchise just in the nick of time!",positive
"I don't usually like Bond movies, but this was a definite exception.",positive
danial craig is one of the best bonds ever.,negative
Always beaten and wants marriage.... is this really 007 ?,negative
very james bond like lol !!,positive
"Daniel Craig...the cutest by far of all the Bonds. I agree, he has the ""pout"" down. Physically smaller than the others, but fast and very agile. Also wit to boot. Loved seeing Bond portrayed as someone other than a womanizer in this film. It was refreshing, and made him more down-to-earth. Hope to see more of him!",positive
"This was the first Bond ive seen and of course all the talk behind it I thought it wouldnt be good at all. But I think he makes a great Bond, different Bond.",positive
"So, to save the world, bond plays poker?",negative
James Bond is back on the road after all these years!!!!!!,positive
"Beste Bondfilmen pÃ¥ lenge, selv om den blir litt kjedelig pÃ¥ slutten..",positive
"Bond's brand is on a tipping point at the moment, but the Casino Royale was a really good move imho.",negative
Couldn't get into this at all. Just not into the Bond movies not matter how hard I true or how many times they change the lead.,negative
....Daniel...he's my type!,positive
the darkest of all bonds and one of the best...,positive
And he's back.... Better than ever... and with a character arc!.... And with no Q?,positive
"Fantastic. Best Bond movie ever, you can't compare the others to this one.",positive
"The only Bond I really dig, this is much better than the old ones!You could feel the Parkour-stunts in your stomach if you went to theater and saw this.Long, but fascinating all the time, kept you going.",positive
"Kudos to Daniel Craig he has re-invigorated the whole Bond franchise and bought something fresh and new to the table. Granted he may have had his doubters, but based on this performance he has silenced them all. Great film, depicting a far grittier, ruthless truer-to-the-novels JB",positive
Best Bond movie ever...Period.,positive
even though i watch it 7 times i still LOVE it !!! and james...well he is james....,positive
Opening action sequence is mind blowing,negative
Absolutaly superb. I am not a James Bond fan but this is a truly great movie. I'm glad they reduced the number of over the top gadgets and this has rescued Bond from being found in the comedy section in Blockbusters.,positive
"I was quite disapointed at this film: Graig mumbles thru his lines and has the charisma of a Russian boxer. There are no intense moments of the plot (what plot?!)thickening but instead a lot of pointless violence with almost nothing to do with the rest of the events potrayed in it.If this is 007 updated, IÂ´d rather the genre stuck with the good old days.",negative
"I actually enjoyed this and, generally, i hate James Bond movies.",negative
Best Bond ever. Daniel Craig is so hot yet believable... A very nice surprise !,positive
"Worth watching because Daniel Craig delivers the kind of bond that the purists want, the kind that Timothy Dalton or George Lazenby could not pull off. Another remarkable thing is that the story is true to the spirit of the book including the brutal torture scene.",positive
This movie was tha best action movie since the flinstones...lol,positive
This was pretty damned good. It freshens up the bond franchise without straying too far from the formula. A (somewhat) fallible bond takes some getting used to. Can't fault Daniel Craig in this though. My only quibble would be the movie isn't quite sure when it is going to end (perhaps not to the degree of 'The Return of the King') but there's a definite lull in the last third of the movie which seems out of place. Curious to see how they handle the next one now that bond has 'learnt his lesson' about trust.,negative
"Bond is redrawn as the cold assassin, and man, he was originally meant to be.",positive
"mmmm, Daniel deserves every star for his wet, dripping near naked body shot...",negative
Le meilleur de tous les James Bond !!!!,positive
Good to see our boy back in a story that doesn't involve him outrunning the sun.,positive
Best Bond movie Yet!! ....loved that it was filming when i was there...lol....I saw parts of the movie first hand...,positive
Great Adventure and beautiful sceneryâ¦â¦,positive
"The poker game was a little out there, but going back to Bond's roots was fantastic!",positive
best bond film for me personly,positive
My all time favorite Bond film! With this one film Daniel Craig became my favorite Bond! It ditches the gadgets and takes itself seriously. Even the Bond girl is interesting as more than just eye candy!,positive
The best Bond ever. Finally the character is believable and diverse.,positive
Amazing action! Beat James Bond movie of them all. Daniel Craig was great - good comedic timing and easy on the eyes. haha. He pouts a little too much though.,positive
"Was OK, but definitely not as good as other Bond films. It just lacked that, I dunno - Craig was excellent in it though. And the lack of advertising through it was definitely a plus.",negative
Simply a high quality film.,positive
"The best Bond film ever made. They've finally found a Bond who's believable and multi-dimensional. Exciting but not overly action-packed, and less brand advertisements than the last few.",positive
"the BEST James Bond movie i have ever seen. Hot, great action, believable, and genuine. I love it",positive
"gritty, hard-edged, action-packed Bond-at-his-best!",positive
"Another franchise-saver, initially returning to the xenophobic brutality and misogyny which founded the series. The hip-five-years-ago parkour further sweetens the pot for rubes. Unfortunately, even the fine cast can't maintain suspense in a finale which replaces Baccarat with Texas Hold `em for an audience that they must have thought to be comprised entirely of Celebrity Poker fans.",negative
"For once, James Bond is a man's man and not some fop.",positive
"daniel craig is a great new james bond. its always a trouble to get a new really good james bond, too. this was chronologically the first james bond novel. it shows bond getting his 007 status and doesnt let up on the intensity and action until the end.",positive
My favourite bond movie!,positive
worst bond ever. Daniels sucks at life,negative
Best bond movie yet!,positive
Absolutely loved this movie.,positive
Finally a new Bond film I didn't need to mock to enjoy.,positive
"Needs more gun fights... Poker is great, but it's a bond movie for crying out loud...",negative
the best bond... ever,positive
Much better than the old crappy ones. The stunts are awesome in the beginning. Well worth it.,positive
Much better than the old crappy ones. The stunts are awesome in the beginning. Well worth it.,positive
"The first true Bond movie. Bond, a tortured, alcoholic hero is intense. Some cool modern toys and effects the previous Bonds didn't have. In the end, I was riveted to the screen.",positive
"A definite improvement on the recent films, although a general lack of excitement pervades the movie.",negative
"I hate James Bond, but I absolutely loved this movie!",positive
"Compared to Goldeneye with Pierce Brosnan, this Bond movie was definitely a good one to watch.",positive
"An improvement in on the most recent Bond films in many ways. However, an almost incredible lack of tension in the poker game kind of ruins the most important part of the film.",negative
L'unico e vero James Bond rimarrÃ  sempre Sean Connery!! Cmq anche questo non male..,negative
Um... I believe I saw this 3 times. Rave=amazing. I want an Aston Martin because on this movie.,positive
One of the best bond flicks out there,positive
kinda fell asleep part way through,negative
The action scenes and scenery throughout the entire movie equals perfection. PS I want to marry him.,positive
Favorite James Bond Movie!!,positive
"brilliant film, Craig plays Bond to perfection, seen on the building site was one of the most exciting scenes i've ever seen",positive
not a bad bond movie,positive
i thought i would hate daniel craig as james bond but I LOVED HIM i think hes a great actor and plays the part well,positive
"I wasn't impressed, I'm a fan of the Bond films but this was too soppy, not as funny and Daniel Craig just doesn't seem right in the role to me.",negative
he is a hell of hot sexy malestud!!!,positive
"Good Bond flick, realistic action. You get to see how and why 007 becomes a hard hearted agent. I did miss Q showing off the gadgets though.",negative
"best of the bond movies. isn't that insane? we live in an era of revolution in bond, batman and zombie movies!",positive
Saw it on movies and DVD. Extremely good for a Bond. Only the card playing part is a bit too long in my opinion. CanÂ´t wait the next chapter..,positive
OHHH Eva green <3 Nipple on=D pause button on remote !,negative
"i love bond movies, this was a little different than other bond movies, not many gadgets, it was a change but a good one. daniel craig was a good choice. you think so???",positive
bloody surprising movie. stripped back bond with someone who turned out to be great in the role,positive
"Bond, Bond, Bond, just call me Moneypenny..",positive
"Sans aucun doute le meilleur James Bond ; enfin on comprend pourquoi 007 est un tel salaud ! En plus, Daniel Craig est Ã  mourir... Mmmmh",positive
Best Bond film ever..,positive
"Terrible plot, but a new sexy Bond and a really entertaining movie",positive
Great 007 re-boot. The free running sequence is absolutely amazing not just for the action but for the exposition of just who is this new 007?,negative
As far as modern day Bond's go this is the best. Craig is brilliant as 007.,positive
Daniel Graig was great,positive
"I never thought I'd like Daniel Craig as Bond. Ironically, it's now my favorite movie of all time.",positive
"it was good, part from the ending was a bit wierd!",negative
"Probably my favourite of the Bond series (that I've seen, anyway). Daniel Craig makes a fairly convincing Bond, although I still think Clive Owen would've bee the better choice. The opening chase scene was fantastically choreographed as well. Possibly the most thrilling scene in the film.",positive
Un tres bon Daniel Craig. Un mechant qui manque de mordant et des james bond girls fadasses. Mais une bonne realisation. Cela reste captivant,negative
"The Best Bond movie! Great action and suspense. Loved it, want to see it again and again.",positive
"Though I was unsure as I love Pierce Brosnan ,Daniel was a great James Bond .",positive
What a great surprise this movie was. I think its the best Bond movie of the all.,positive
"I wasnt sure if I would like a blond Bond. Daniel Craig proved me wrong. This is the BEST Bond ever. Very compelling story that follows the book very closely. Fewer 'gadgets', more intrigue and action.",positive
eva green a excelÃ© ds son role je trouve,negative
"Amazing action movie and the best Bond movie yet. Daniel Craig is wonderful as Bond. Amazing action and we see a different side, a human side to Bond",positive
Was very wary about seeing this film. But loved every minute of it. Especially the poker parts,positive
Craig are the best Bond in the world!!!,positive
"NOT the best bond film ever! It was slow many many times. Needed more action, more toys, and more whitt. If you like to watch people playing poker for half of the movie then this is the movie for you. hahaha",negative
Daniel Craig... Mmmmmmm!,negative
Pretty good. Think Craig is a tad to old looking to play the spy-in-making. A little unrefined for Bond but hopefully that was done on purpose - will have to wait for the next one to see.,positive
"i thought this bond film was the best out of all of the bond films that i have watched. daniel craig as james bond and eva green as the bond girl really go together. they're kind of like each other's equal b/c this bond girl, vesper, is intelligent and strong, just like bond. also, daniel craig was really hot in this film.",positive
Paras Bond pitkÃ¤Ã¤n aikaan. Kaikki Brosnanin Bondit olivat vain harmaata massaa.TÃ¤mÃ¤ erottuu edukseen jo alkusekuneista lÃ¤htien. Sopivasti yhdistelty tÃ¤mÃ¤n hetken kuumimpia juttuja kuten pokeri ja parkour.,positive
Second best bond film..apart from Thunderball,positive
Nice movie ... Daniel Craig is very nice actor ..,positive
This movie is bond. I still think Connery is where the character starts but this guy does a better knock off,positive
This movie is bond. I still think Connery is where the character starts but this guy does a better knock off,positive
This is superb. I loved the Peirce Brosnan films but Daniel Craig brings a hardness and toughness to Bond which I love,positive
Surprisingly good for a 50 year old series.,positive
"The best Bond since Sean Connery. Love his looks, his attitude. He's an English Jack Reacher!",positive
I thought this movie was great. It didn't take long to get use to a new actor playing 007 :P The action was good as well.,positive
"Quite possibly the best entry in the venerable Bond series to date. Superbly written by Bond standards, Daniel Craig humanizes bond like no actor has done before.",positive
What an entrance for Craig! This is a heart-pumping adrenaline rush from start to finish. No unbelievable stunts in THIS Bond movie (cough Die another day cough).,positive
Cool movie! Wish all the hot babes did'nt have to get wasted!That just dont set right with me.,positive
"Daniel Graig is surely the ugliest Bond, but he is the BEST...",positive
"The best James Bond film in years (If not the best ever made), with the best James Bond since Connery.",positive
""" Like Clive Owen said they didn't give the part away to some fucking model they gave it to an actor. Add a great story line, breath taking action, and a Bond so good you'll demand a letter of apology from Pierce Bronsan.""",positive
"I was one of the many skeptics. I could tolerate a blonde Bond, but no gadgets? What were they thinking? Glad I was proven horribly wrong.",positive
I bet no one has seen the orginal,positive
Awesome action from begining to end,positive
Best. Bond. Movie. ever.,positive
the best bond movie ever,positive
Resurrected the Bond series.,positive
the best bond film...shoot first ask questions later,positive
"I thought I was gonna hate Craig as the new Bond, but I really loved him... great performance!",positive
Incorporation of holdem is laughable... take those rockets to the moon,negative
"I wasn't too excited about seeing this film. I am always prepared for a new Bond to fail miserably and am always expecting Bond to have a multitude of women in his sexist machismo way. Well, I was happily proven wrong. This is a GREAT movie which captivates you from the very beginning. Watch it - you won't be disappointed.",positive
"Bond pelaa pokeria, rakastuu ja melkeen menee naimisiin. Tähänkö se tasa-arvotupo johtaa?",negative
"Good. Much like the books, where Bond is NOT a cheesy pun tossing man whore. Hes an asshole. Hes cold. and i applaud this movie for staying closer to the book.",negative
"Rougher than the Sean Connery-Roger Moore versions from the '60s, but I absolutely loved it. There is no doubt that Craig is a great Bond.",positive
Dare I say...best Bond movie ever. The perfect action movie.,positive
"one of the best, and hottest",positive
bond's rebooted/remade resorting back 2 basics as each prior mission got more bloated+ridiculous. craig finally breaks thru carrying a film. action is raw/real stuntwork amt'ing to a great actioner. i can't wait for the next one!,positive
"the best bond movie ever! i was really skeptical to have craig as bond, but he was a very pleasant surprise...",positive
I love 007 style movies.,positive
Opening sequence is cool but rest of the movie is tedious.,negative
"Finally Bond is no longer cheesy, Roger Moore being the cheesiest. Bond is finally more like a real person. Craig is by far the best Bond yet.",positive
Loved this movie. Can't wait for the next one.,positive
Great chase scenes but a bad Bond.,negative
Hierdie Bond vat nie k@k nie.,positive
"A great reboot to the series. Daniel Craig is fantastic, Eva Green might be my favorite bond girl.",positive
Best Bond film since On Her majesty's secret service!!,positive
Best Bond Movie yet..,positive
Truly thunderous kick-starting of the franchise. So good it makes you realise how poor Bond had become. Let's have Paul Greengrass direct all the books in order with Craig in the lead role.,positive
Best Bond movie in a while. Daniel Craig is awesome.,positive
"Fantastic Bond movie, not enough action scenes, but his character has improved. The optimistic joker and the womanizing personality was getting redundant, so Daniel Craig made the better Bond.",positive
"Even if you have never seen a James Bond flick or care anything about them, this movie will entertain. Its got plenty of action, glib one liners, and still tells the story of how JB found his badassery.",positive
Connerin jÃ¤lkeisten tylsien bondileffojen pÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¶s - toivottavasti tyyli pysyy jatkossa samana.,positive
"Ca faisait des annees que je n'avais pas ete voir un James Bond au cinema. Ces films bourres d'effets speciaux, d'explosions et de cascades pour petits pisseux etaient a l'evidence des signes de proxenetisme commercial. Pourtant, je me suis laisse embarque dans la nouvelle version que l'on m'avait annoncee comme fondamentalement differente. J'ai tout simplement adore! Ce cote noir et tres cynique du personnage, vulnerable mais a la fois tres fort. Et pour une fois une intrigue pas trop tiree par les cheveux. Avec, cependant, toujours quelques bonnes scenes d'action pour ne pas perdre la marque de fabrique des films de la serie. Le tout interprete par un Daniel Craig impressionant de charisme et investi par le role alors qu'on ne l'attendait pas aÂ  ce niveau! Pour moi, sans doutes le meilleur des James Bond. A voir absolument! Pour les garcons du moins. Les filles, plus fleurs bleues, risquent de ne pas y trouver leur compte: comble du comble, ma fiancee s'est endormie pendant la sceance!",positive
Taas on Bondilla hommia ja tÃ¤tÃ¤ 007 kelpaa kattella.,positive
Best bond in a while. Especially like the opening chase sequence.,positive
"Meni aikaa totuttautua uuteen hahmoon, mutta silti se on Bond!",positive
surprisingly good Bond - in many ways :-),positive
Good Bond. Good Bond girl. Good action. Good all around. The title song is one of my favorites.,positive
Is it heresy to say that Sean Connery is no longer the best James Bond....,positive
"The most amazing James Bond film, so far",positive
Think Daniel craig made an exellent bond ut thought the film could have ended half an hour before it did,positive
Perhaps the best interpretation of Bond ever.,positive
Love his eyes..! Felt for him on the chair..,negative
oh yes daniel craig in those trunks! need i say more,positive
One of the best Bond films in a very long time.,negative
"Even if you can't have the novelty of Sean Connery in the awesome ""Goldfinger"" 40 years down the road, ""Casino Royale"" is as good as any James Bond movie ever made, and probably the most involving. It recreates Bond as a rugged 21st-century anti-hero, ruthless and tough, smart and cunning, witty and charming --- exactly what he should be. Daniel Craig is as good as Connery.",positive
"Not quite smooth enough to be the Bond of my dreams, but he did have a greater depth of charachter than some prior actors.",negative
I fell in Love with James at 3years old and that's the first that i've cried of pain for him! So violent!!!needless. But I've to admit that this is the best Bond ever!,positive
"Film je tako glup, al sam ga zbog onako lijepe Crne Gore stavila u Top Movies...",negative
daniel craig-corrrrrrr!,positive
czy to moja wina ze kocham Jamesa?! to jest slepa milosc na cale zycie!,positive
Beste Bond-film ever,positive
one of the best bond films,positive
"He IS Bond. A film with great characterisation, not glorifying the violence, good screenplay and fantastic acting. Revitalised the Bond franchise. Can't wait for the next one.",positive
"The film that puts Bond back where he belongs. The producers had the balls to get rid of Brosnan before he did a Roger Moore and turned into Sid James, and all the Daniel Craig detractors should hang their heads in shame.",positive
"A true revival of an old franchise. The last few James Bond movies have been dull and avoidable, but Casino Royale changes all of that. It has a blend of action and story line that many movies now days fail to accomplish. GReat film for any Bond lover and even for casual movie goers.",positive
Top film! James Blond rocks!,positive
Den enda Bond filmen som jag gillat rÃ¤tt igenom. Craig Ã¤r het! Mads Ã¤r sagolik. Vilken film!,positive
"The best Bond movie with Goldfinger. Goes back to the original Bond style, while reinventing it at the same time.",positive
This bond is missing that self assured sense of humour that I've come to like in other Bonds,negative
bond is not a nice guy and finally we get to see that..,positive
One of the best Bond-movies ever!!,positive
"The series gets reinvented and manages to succeed in virtually every way. Craig is already one of the best Bonds after his action packed inaugral outing. While the plot is a standard issue remake, the execution of it is anything but standard. Throughly enjoyable.",positive
"I thought this would be the true-to-Fleming dark, kill people because he's hungover Bond that Craig is more than capable of playing. It wasn't. Bah.",negative
"If you're down with the poker scene, this is the one for you.",positive
The best bond movie yet. Just gotta get use to the guy thats playing him.,positive
Love the soundtrack and the car. Teh best Bond movie in ages. And it will age well.,positive
Do I really need to point out why this is a FAB film...the ladies out there know what I mean!!,positive
"I don't do Bond I don't the bullshittyness of bond films, but i loved Casino Royale. Daniel Craig is class in it, Will def watch another Bond film if it is like this one. Casino Royale was believable.I think Jason Bourne is much cooler than Bond though.",positive
"At last, a bond film worth watching! And hey, Bond actually bleeds!! Daniel Craig superbly took us away from the ""Camp"" films of Moore and co and showed what balls Bond really has! Shame about wrecking the DB9 though -criminal!",positive
"for a bond movie, this was pretty good!",negative
"James Bond travels back to the days before he gets the 007 status. The action is non-stop, from start to finish, and the old, reckless James we all see. Drama was boring, though the sepias were eye-catching!!",negative
"I can see why some people don't like the reboot of the series, but good god, Craig's Bond is a million times more raw and flawed than the perfect Bonds that came before him, which makes it interesting and enjoyable to watch. Who wants to watch a movie when you know the hero will do everything perfectly? Plus, dude, he's really really hot.",positive
KyllÃ¤ tuo Danielin nakuilu vakuutti mut ja pistÃ¤Ã¤ hÃ¤net Connery rinnalle Bondin esittÃ¤misessÃ¤..,positive
"What a great experience on BluRay! The flashback B&W scenes look really gritty and old, and then the stunning detail for all the action is awesome. Visually great, aurally great, and I'm a big Parkour fan, so seeing Sebastien Foucan in a great chase scene was a nice treat. I'd have to agree it was the best Bond so far, even if the theme music is rather ""average"".",positive
"not really much of a bond movie, but a solid action movie",negative
ok the scene where he's getting tortured yeah that wins it for me,positive
"it wasn't bad and daniel craig was good, but it just wasn't james bond.",negative
I had doubts but was proven wrong,negative
not my favorite james bond,positive
I love how they systematically go through a lot of the Bond stereotypes and address which ones they'll keep and which ones they toss.,positive
Great edgy flick that brought back meaning to Brocoli's image of Bond.,positive
"The way ""Bond"" was supposed to be. I hope the remake some classics with Daniel Craig!",positive
Great film. Love the way they've rebooted the franchise. Craig is the perfect fit here.,positive
"I suppose the reason I liked it so much, was that I was worried to death that they were going to destroy the film... but Daniel Craig does a superb job, the fight scenes actually look real for once... and the film really lets everyone know that James Bond is back, and better then ever!",positive
The ending is the best.....,positive
I can't believe I liked a bond move. How could this be good?! But believe me it was.,positive
May have single handedly revived the previously limp dicked bond series. Less reliance on the fantastical devices that had began to plague the bond series. Instead bond uses his ingenuity and fists to own up chumps.,negative
Best Bond Film in a long time.,positive
One of the best 007s,positive
Best bond. I can't wait until he is in another one.,positive
"Is it a great movie along the lines of 'The Godfather' or 'Citizen Kane'? No. Is it great to watch? Hell yes. That, and Eva Green? Hi, welcome to so incredibly hot.",negative
"Totally the best Bond film, has the best intro credits and the best first scene.",positive
Best Bond ever.... Parcour....cars...Eva green....Eva Green...eva Green...... WOW awesome movie ..even if its a james bond flick,positive
The best Bond film featuring the best Bond.,positive
"one of the best bonds so much more realistic, Daniel Craig oohhh",positive
A more darker Bond the way it should be..,positive
The best bond film since the Sean Connery classics of the 60's.,positive
"Geeeze, this is a great movie...",positive
Omg soo freaking boring...,negative
A triumph. Daniel Craig brings back Ian Fleming's bond from Fleming's best novel.,positive
Daniel Craig er den nye Connery!,positive
"Fantastic Bond film. The way Bond should be. Gritty fighting, some gadgetry, but Craig still makes him debonair. Very human Bond, not a cartoon like some others have portrayed him.",positive
Bond is blond...how cool is that!,positive
Best Bond movie in years!,positive
"There has been a lot of controversy on Daniel Craig on the fact that he was a blond. People should ignore that and accept that he's no Connery or Brosnan. Daniel Craig did a great job as Bond and he definately didn't play around like I thought some of the others did. He'd ether kill or leave alone, not hold a gun to a man and threaten him. On the whole, Casino Royale is one of best Bond films in the franchise.",positive
"Ahhh... This is how my crush on Daniel Craig began, he looks perfect! The movie is also good =D",positive
Best Bond movie I've seen in a while. A WHILE!,positive
"The best bond movie ever, no doubt. Daniel craig is the perfect blend of stoich, athletic and knowledgeable for a Bond role. The poker stuff is weak and cheesy, some of the plot wasn't that great, but it was damn good.",positive
"I disliked most others James Bond movies. This one was good, although James was shown a stupid and idiotic man in this film, it's only man realistic I guess. HAHA!",positive
"After 'From Russia with Love' this is probably the best Bond ever made. Craig gives a muscular and raw performance that makes the character his own and makes the last 35 years seem a whole lot more camp. I love the Moore/Dalton/Brosnan movies, but Craig would eat them for breakfast.",positive
i have to say he's no sean connery but he is an awesome bond. better then all except connery,positive
"Never been a huge bond fan, this movie captivated me. And Daniel Craig is on my list that if I ever could, he is on my list that my husband allow me to sleep with him. Truly unexpected sexy dude.",positive
Daniel Craig.. nuff said!!!,positive
Haven't enjoyed a Bond film this much since the days of Sean Connery. Daniel Craig is superb.,positive
tks to daniel craig coz pierce brosman wasn t good at all......,positive
"Not really a bond fan but Daniel Craig is great, much better as Bond than boring Pierce Brosnan. Worth watching with a cup of tea and a biscuit waiting for Daniel Craig to appear out of the sea. Over the top scenes specially at the beginning but overall a great 'night in' dvd.",positive
"While it can't entirely escape the confines of a Bond movie, it gets one thing right that just about everybody else has missed: Bond hates people, and that's what makes him so good at his job.",positive
"First bond film I have ever seen and it was great, action packed and daniel craig is hot!",positive
"This is my favorate Bond move. It shows his struggle to become the character portrayed in earlier films. He makes mistakes, he is human. Also brings back a lot of classic elements of old Bond films.",positive
awsome one of my fav oo7 movies,positive
Bond som faktiskt funkar,negative
i love the action scenes,negative
"Best Bond ever! (and I've seen them all, so I should know.)",positive
"pour steph, avec steph...",negative
"A brilliant movie that brings Bond back to his roots. Re-establishing the character of Bond over the flashy gadgets once again. Even if you're not a fan of Bond films this is worth checking out, it may just change your mind.",positive
"revitalizes the bond world. raw, strong, thrilling stunts.",positive
"Finalmente un film di James Bond che non punta tutto sugli effetti speciali. Trama interessante, ritmo serrato, stile piÃ¹ vicino ai Bond del celebre Connery e una Bond girl Eva Green che non Ã¨ solo una bella bambola. Mi Ã¨ piaciuto.",negative
The best Bond movie of all time.,positive
Best film ever daniel daniel daniel um that is bond,positive
I'd do Bond in a heartbeat... so bad!,positive
"for once, a 007 movie was fun to watch",negative
"The best Bond movie ever, and the best Bond ever. Great mix of terrific acting and great action sequences",positive
Great setting n' actions!,negative
best bond movie since the days of sean connery.. daniel criag was just amazing ..,positive
"Back to where it all began. Upon acquiring his double-0 status, James Bond (Daniel Craig) heads to Montenegro where he must participate in a high stakes Poker game at Casino Royale in hopes that his winning will stop the funding of terrorism in the world. Also stars Eva Green, Judi Dench, Mads Mikkelsen, Giancarlo Giannini and Jeffrey Wright. Directed by Martin Campbell.",positive
"The BESTEST Bond film by far. Quite a long film at 2hours 20 mins, but don't let that put you off. It's action packed from beginning to end, with a credible actor and a decent script.",positive
The best Bond Film yet!! The Best Bond yet!! Sean was the master but his throne has been taken!!!,positive
"More plot, less cheese and better characterization of Bond makes this the best in the series of James Bond films.",positive
Cool....enige James Bond movie is cool.Punt. James Bond is cool.Punt,positive
James Bond.. Whats not to like...,positive
best film and new bond i well what can i say nice body?,negative
"Excellent action, great James Bond and cant wait for the next one.",positive
The best James Bond film ever.,positive
"Who knew this Aryan-looking dude would be the most badass Bond and post-modern, quasi-Bournesque heir to Sean Connery's 007 throne?",positive
Daniel Craig was brilliant- and the opening sequence ( the chase) was awesome. I thought it would never end----,positive
Coolest Bond movie ever.,positive
You just cant beat Brosnan as Bond - It was a disappointment and left me wanting Brosnan back I watched it a second time and it has grown on me. Missed the lack of a car chase,negative
"After battling two thugs in a gritty and gruesome stairwell encounter, our infamous spy collects himself in his suite bathroom. He then proceeds to down a glass of hard liquor in one gulp. Bond hunches, staring blindly into the mirror, panting in exhaustion, covered in blood. Welcome to the Bond youâve never seen. This is the real tone and reality of Ian Flemingâs novel character and his environments. Amongst tons of other scenes, this scene sold me that Daniel Craig is James Bond. The controversial casting by the producers, (which I hated his selection at first) proved to be the greatest investment they could ever make. He has it all: the suaveness, the charm, the wit, the arrogance, the masochism, and most importantly, the deadliness. Iâll be honest; I love this guy and Fleming would be proud. âCasino Royaleâ introduces unexplored emotional territories of the character, successfully adapting the dark tone of the first smash novel, specifically Bond's fateful weakness of falling for his beautiful counterpart Vesper Lynd, and pulling the story from the Cold War to the 21st century, while maintaining a comfortable sense of humor. It may place James Bond now into the reality of real life, finally, but still joyfully retains the trademark ""fantasy"" world he lives in in much smaller, effective doses. Furthermore, the producers faithfully use the novel's twist ending, but in a more cinematic manner. I only wished for several scenes to have to made it into the screenplay from the book, but why carp? Oh, if only I could enlarge this review! In itself, if one would pull back the layers, âRoyaleâ is a damn well-made film and fantastic entertainment, filled with a supremely talented international cast, crisp and gritty cinematography, maturation in David Arnoldâs scoring efforts (after how poor âDie Another Dayâ and Madonnaâs song was that he even loathed), strong writing; all the Bond elements are in place, fit fairly snuggly with a Walther handgun. âThe jobâs done, and the bitch is dead,â the agent mutters coldly. Now Bond must slowly extract revenge on those who helped to destroy him in his most sensitive part: his heart.",positive
Only good James Bond movie.,positive
love him...canadian eh!,positive
"A great relaunch of the Bond franchise, Daniel Craig fits perfectly as a Bond in the early years, whats even cooler is the next film is suppose to be a direct sequel to this one.",positive
"Action-packed, gritty and more ""realistic"" Bond movie compared with other recent movies in the Bond series. I actually like this new guy and how Bond wasn't portrayed like some invincible guy with 1000 gadgets. Very good movie.",positive
Finally a real James Bond.,positive
This movie was so bomb. Now I want to see it again,positive
"Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond - but that's the only good thing I can say about the film...oh, and the first minute rocked - should have shot the entire film in B&W.",negative
oooh yeah. i REALLY like this bond boy. I watched this on the plane to San Diego and had nice conversations with the people next to me :D,positive
"A sometimes fascinating, sometimes boring introduction to a new Bond and his new entourage.",negative
"This movie blew me away. I had never been a Bond fan, really, before this but this was incredible. Daniel Craig IS Bond. He is able to portray this intense cold strength a secret agent would have to have, while at the same time maintaining emotions held in close. Excellent.",positive
"my favorite bond movie, the new guy kicks Peirce's ass on the Bad ass Meter",positive
The only Bond film that I have watched and liked!! He is sooo hot!! and the poker appeals to me too!!,positive
Its good to see Bond how I always imagined a spy should be. A bad-ass who beats the shit outta people.,positive
Best movie of the decade,positive
I didn't really enjoy it...,negative
One of the best Bonds ever made. Daniel Craig is a combination of Sean Connery and Roger Moore.,positive
One of my favorite Bond movies.,positive
"Best bond film in many, many years.",positive
Verdict is still out on James Blonde.,negative
Pierce! Where are you???,negative
Worth it for the opening stunt - and D.C.,positive
I liked it...i like all bond movies,negative
wow what a film. i was a bit unsure at first but daniel craig pulled it off brilliantly. can't wait for the next one.,positive
Not a Bond film. Labeling an action film a Bond film and naming the character James BOnd just doesn't cut it. Go back to your roots!,negative
"If you expect to see a regular Bond movie, you will go hungry. No special effects, no super gadgets, no complicated plot. But then again, it is not without action. If you overlook a little anachronism (it's supposed to be Bond's first mission after he is promoted double 0, wich is roughly 30 years ago, but he drives a 2006 car and uses sophisticated computers), this is a good movie about James Bond, the man. You get to know how his character was built. Daniel Craig is more than adequate even if at times he lacks Bond's sense of humor. Girls will fall for his lovely blue eyes. All in all, a good movie to watch.",positive
This is how Bond SHOULD be done.,positive
"Daniel Craig is a good bond, the opening sequence is great, but the plot is too inconsistent.",negative
do not under any circumstances watch this movie!!,negative
Daniel Craig as a young brilliant Bond.,positive
This is the first Bond movie I've seen.,positive
Bondit on kuraa. TÃMÃ EI.Daniel Graig on oikea henkilÃ¶. Ei mikÃ¤Ã¤n fiktiivinen 50-vuotias gigolo.Aikuisten toimintaleffa.,positive

"""Shaken or stirred, Sir? ""Do I look like I really give a damn""",positive
Daniel Craig...THAT IS IT,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond in the Franchise's history! Extremely entertaining!,positive
A much grittier Bond. Betting every guy who wathced it crossed there legs near the end. You know what im tlaking about.,positive
"I'm not a bod fan, but the hype gpt me to this one- in its favour: Mr Craig, the girl not getting her kit off, Judi Dench, Vesper cracking up afterthe fight on the stairs- yes, a body or two can upset you for.. ooh two whole hours? I can't begin on how bored I got with the poker game. Not my sort of movie, and I like action flicks, so what is going on here? About an hour too long.",negative
A fantastic re-envisioning of Bond. Less puns more guns = good!,positive
very smooth movie. kind of long but has a great story line. makes you keep thinking ahead and that the movie is going to end. a lot of good twists,positive
Started great! Should have ended after the poker game. The ending draggggggggged pointlessly.,negative
"I just watched this, and I gotta admit something. I used to hate Bond. I hate Pierce Brosnan, that's probably the reason... But Daniel Craig made me change my mind. A lovely character, a great story, and Daniel Craig! Oh wow!",positive
Still not convinced that Craig is really Bond but it's a good film none-the-less,negative
"gritty intelligent action movie, why are they so rare?",positive
ÃksÃ¶niÃ¤ normi Potkukelkkaa enemmÃ¤n!,negative
"Bond is BACK. Daniel Craig eats Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan for dinner. I was so pumped during this movie I was texting people saying ""CASINO ROYALE FUCKING RULES""",positive
Un excellent James Bond,positive
"Really good remake, at first I was unsure of Daniel Craig as the new Bond. But, he pulls it off quite well.",positive
top notch; I just love ALL Bond movies!!,positive
"It's Bond, need I say more?",positive
"Excellent. No stupid gadgets, no invisible cars, daftly worked one liners. This was the best bond movie for ages. Although as there was no dialogue for the first 15 minutes, they clearly aren't going for best screenplay...!",positive
"People doubted his bond-ability... but Daniel Craig kicks ass, and a new Bond legacy has begun, for sure.",positive
"I read Ian Flemming's book and I watched James Bond movies but I am not a fan. So when I saw this movie, I set my expectation quite low. Just killing free time with an action movie. But I was so surprised. It's different. Usually James Bond's movies always have standard scenes. But this time... No more silly gadgets. No more villains who want to conquer the world (and then what???). No more girls as movie's sweetener. No more Bond's charm to manipulate sexy enemy's girl. No more unbelievable car chasing and other unbelievable action scenes. The story, surprisingly, is quite complex, thrilling, with a twisted ending. No more overdose action scenes (the longest action sequence is in the opening when James chases and shoots down a bomb-maker). Some trademarks are still there : ""Bond, James Bond"", sexy car (this time back to Aston Martin), and promoting Omega.. (Is it Rolex... No, Omega). Daniel Craig is also the right choice for this reborn James Bond. Verdict : This movie tries to set a new image for Bond's movie, and it works beautifully!",positive
"Different than all the rest of the Bond flicks. Kinda nice to have a change. However this is supposed to be the ""first"" James Bond story, however it all happens after 9/11. If you are really going to have something that is the first, the timing should pretend to match it.",negative
"Even though I haven't seen all of the previous films about James Bond. However I really did enjoy It. It was very good. It had a lot of Action, some Romance which I also like. Even though the Action Scenes were spectatular I really liked how in this one It showed how he became Bond to begin with, and this 1 really allowed Bonds Character to develop unlike some other Bond Movies which I've seen even though their still good of course. Daniel Craig plays a great James Bond, and Eva Green plays well as her Character too as well even as James Bond first ever love interest.",positive
I'am a real fan of James... Hum Daniel... Just as good as Sean!,positive
enjoyed from the start a litle darker than normal bonds and it worked !,positive
AAAAmazing- proper bond- loved the fight seens V Bourne esk!,positive
"Paras Bond-filmi vuosiin. Brosnanin aikojen mÃ¤iske ja vempeleet on jÃ¤tetty vÃ¤hemmÃ¤lle, Bond ihmisenÃ¤ on nyt pÃ¤Ã¤osassa. Toimintaa ja Bond-huumoriakin riittÃ¤Ã¤.",positive
Tried to hate it...but couldnt!,positive
"The Jackie Chan nonsense at the constrauction site was tough to take, the female lead turns in a tepid performance, the darker mood, the slightly higher degree of realism and Daniel Craig's Bond were enough to reinvigorate the entire franchise though",negative
the bond franchise was in desperate need of a reboot .... its oozes class and is 2nd only to dr no,positive
great would have got top marks just the lack of car chases b ut less bond cheese and a very good action film,positive
"Not a huge Bond fan, but this one kicked ass. Probably b/c it's more like Bourne Identity than Bond.",positive
Best Bond movie I've seen.,negative
Pas mal mais trop blond :o,negative
wass gudddd BOND PERFECT,negative
"This is not like a typical Bond movie is used to be, but there is still the same unique feeling and atmosphere! This was much better than i expected!",positive
Best Bond movie ever.,positive
"This film is wicked :] sad, but wicked. everyone should see it!",positive
I guess I don't completely hate Daniel Craig as James Bond anymore.,positive
I want to see Bond shooting people in the head instead of playing poker and being in love. Boring!!!,negative
baÅtan sona aksiyon...mutlaka izleyin...,negative
"Aston Martin DBS! and Daniel Craig does well, although Pierce Brosnan's face is still stuck in my mind.",positive
A very different Bond movie - showing a darker and more human side to Bond. He actually gets hurt and bleeds in this movie. Definitely not as glamorous as the previous Bond movies and hence more realistic and watchable.,negative
"Welcome to the new 007 world, where Bond is now a charmless brute, the bad guy is a wimp, the plot just drags on and on, there's hardly any action, and no cool gadgets. This might be closer to the novels, but this is not the Bond I knew and loved as a kid. Count me out.",negative
"The only Bond film to give 007 so much freedom to kill, love, think, and develop. Maybe not exactly what you'll see winning the Best Of Oscar, but it WAS the most entertaining movie of 2006.",positive
"I would sell my soul for a chance to sex up Eva Green for one evening. The wha? The movie? Oh yeah, it was pretty cool, I guess.",positive
Hot! It's been only twice I've gone to see some film multiple times: this and E.T.!!,positive
I love the new direction they've taken the Bond movies. It's closer to what I've heard the original books are like (which I fully intend to read one day).,positive
Best Bond since Connery. This covering from a recovering Bondophile.,positive
Just about the right pitch and tone for a spellbinding modern Bond flick.,negative
I still say Sean Connery wears the suit the best...Definitely a better Bond than the last few tho,positive
"I think this is the best Bond movie yet. The last few Bonds have been pretty cartoonish, this guy has the goods.",positive
Loved.. I thought this Bond was more dark and serious than the ones out of the Brosnan line.,positive
i like the action scenes... Daniel Craig is doing fine in his acting.,positive
This was the first James Bond movie I've ever seen and I was Extremely impressed! Action-packed and Daniel Craig was intense!,positive
My favourite Fleming book is now my favourite film. A truly invigorating re-invention of a franchise that had become unintelligible under Brosnan.,positive
Best Bond Movie.....hands down,positive
"This is the best James Bond movie I'd ever seen. Very interesting Story line... real action. Daniel Craig so stylish,women's dream bond ;)",positive
"The best James Bond movie by far, and an all-around damn good flick.",positive
The movie with the scene that made guys hurt around the world.,positive
"What ""Batman Begins"" did for the Batman franchise, ""Casino Royale"" does the same thing for the James Bond franchise, and that is a very, VERY good thing. The movie goes back to the well of Bond lore and starts from the beginning as we see Bond start out rough around the edges as a new 007. He is more cold, brutish, and to-the-point but still a charmer and ladykiller. Daniel Craig brings depth to what was a tired cookie cutter role and makes the viewer even sympathize for Bond. Could Craig be better than Connery? It's still too early to tell, but he's got potential. The movie gets a little corny about 2 hours in, but other than that it's a solid action/adventure.",positive
I love Daniel Craig as Bond.,positive
This wasnt exactly your classic james bond character but it was still good,positive
"I really enjoyed it. Lots of action. I think it ""honoured"" the ""bond"" franchise well.",positive
"Only james bond movie i ever liked, probs because of the hot boddyyyyy",positive
meilleur james bond ever daniel craig est excellent,positive
More of an action film versus a Bond movie but it was still good. The ending was prolonged a bit too much though.,positive
"Not just another Bond film with gadgets, guns and girls. Daniel Craig brings Bond back to solid earth and emotion.",positive
Great new James Bond! Craig portrays a more vulnerable and sensitive James Bond despite his dark combative and mercilous nature.,positive
"This was my first Bond film, and I intend to see more. Craig is the ideal Bond.",positive
Bond at his best; I am a fan of the series but this film possesses a depth unlike any of the others. Here begins the true bond.,negative
hes an awesome bond...,positive
"Apart from the fact james bond plays a really shit game of poker, he leads the way for drinking, drug taking then heading straight for the ""carpark"", what a marvellous inpression us brits must give to the world ! ""martini - rosso on the rocks, not bianco, and no shaking or stirring just hurry up you twat!""",negative
"Brings James Bond bang up to date, a brilliant film!",positive
Daniel Craig is some prime beef. No one wears clothes the way this man can.,positive
"This movie rekindled my love of Bond that started in my middle school years. The writers did a terrific job taking a slight 180-page novel from 1953 and updating and expanding it for today. At first I had mixed feelings about their changing the central game from Baccarat to No Limit Hold 'Em, but it works.",positive
gran renacimiento de la franquicia.,positive
"I was skeptical, but he was an amazing bond (Connery-esque)",positive
one of the best BOND movies ever!!!,positive
"I have never been a fan of the James Bond films. To me, they were a mess of James Bond using gadgets and fancy cars non-stop and still finding time to have sex with every female who crosses his path. But after I saw this movie, I had to see it again and then get it on DVD. Daniel Craig is, in my opinion, the best Bond ever for the gritty and grizzled nature he brings to the role. Bond actually being in a fist-fight for the first time (to my knowledge) in any of his movies automatically sets it apart. The realistic nature is another aspect that really sets this movie apart. The film took the top prize at the Taurus World Stunt Awards, and really action films in general back to the wonderful basics rather than relying on CGI and unbelievable spectacle. The best Bond film ever. I look forward to seeing Daniel Craig again in the follow-up.",positive
Hot and sexy and that was just Eva Green. The movie was not bad either.,positive
film de lannÃ©e 2006 pis ceux qui disent non c'est parce qu'ils l'ont pas compris,positive
"fantastic. Brutal, ultra cool. Just fantastic!!",positive
Everyone thought it would be awful - but its great!,positive
I love James. And he does a wonderful job playing him,positive
Reaally good. Much better than last 007's movies. Best: Eva Green all the way. What is it about casinos that make them soo interesting?,positive
Daniel Craig is superb and once again Martin Campbell has created the next thing in Bond!,positive
"Ok...I know many of you do not agree, just look at is a the beginning. It gives insight about 007. Oh and the new guy is HOT!",positive
Just what the series needed.,positive
Best Bond film in years.,negative
"ok, i don't like daniel craig. or didn't like him. but, surprisingly, he is bond. well, next to connery. this film is quite long, at 2 1/2 hours, and it tends to drag. but they're is plenty of mind-numbing action. enough to make you just stare at the screen and not think about work the next day. i may watch this again in like 2 months.",negative
"Un superbe retour aux sources, aux livres de Fleming. La classe !",positive
"One of the best Bond movies, in my opinion.",positive
"Un bon film d'action. En prime, le beau Daniel Craig!",positive
I think Daniel Craig will be one of the best bonds ever.,positive
Really entertaining -James Bond at its best. A reference title on Blu-ray.,positive
Daniel Craig's moment of vindication!,negative
it was good but was looking to see more tech gagets but overal it was a big difference from the other ones.,positive
Daniel Craig is an awesome fucking bond,positive
Best Bond I've seen.,positive
"Very interesting moovie. Bond is more physical. More duels, more fight. My name is Bond, James Bond... To be seen",positive
I have a weakness for 007... this movie's awesome,positive
The best Bond film? No chance The best Bond? Oh yes!,positive
this is awesome on Blu Ray,positive
"The best Bond ever. Stylish and memorable in so many ways, I bought this for my library. I love Parkour.",positive
"The only Bond movie I've ever enjoyed! Loved Daniel Craig as Bond! He was just perfect...tough but not too macho, charming but not disgusting. Oh, and did I mention amusing?",positive
"I was skeptical everytime they've tried to reboot 007 (For Your Eyes Only, Living Daylights, so on), but after about three minutes of CR, my bias melted away, and I was all ""Holy shit - James Bond's about to drown a dude in a urinal!""",positive
bestbond film to date,positive
Great show about first mission.,positive
"The opening of this film was, at least for me, unintentionally funny. The bathroom fight? I kept waiting to hear ""Who....does....number....two....work...for?"" And then the villian being an asthmatic who weeps blood!?! The first time he took a pull on that inhaler, I just about lost it. Now if only they had sharks w/ frickin' laser beams on their heads. So all that silliness aside, the action was pretty awesome, but overall the movie felt very uneven. And I give Daniel Craig props for his achievements in general beefcakery...although personally, I much prefer Jason Statham when it comes to the intersection of hotness and Britishness.",negative
"After the last three entries, Casino Royale was 007's redemption. This movie revived my love for Bond. It showed his gritty, tough nature and had one of the best finales ever. Martin Campbell should make as many Bonds as possible.",positive
"Overrated, but better than the previous three.",negative

Just love the newest Bond...Daniel Craig is a MAN!,positive
Daniel Criag in blue speedos - need we say more. I saw this twice in 3 days - Had to make the most of the big screen,positive
If it wasn't for 24 and the success of the Bourne movies this film would never had been made and the Bond franchise lost forever. I'd like to think the grittyness of this Bond is a homege to Jack Bauer in as much as Fleming's 007 was on the spy genre,negative
"i was and i still am a fan of the old bond movies, specially roger moore.so when i saw Daniel Craig as JB, i was a bit disapointed... but JB is new and so are and will be the new episodes and i luved that JB as much as Octopussy or For your eyes Only. 2and a half hours of entertainment at his best.",positive

"liked this film more than i thought i would. twas good, dark, funny... everything a bond film should be. still protesting against Bond's blondeness tho",negative
Pretty badass. I was suprised,positive
My kind of movie. Time will tell whether it becomes one of my favorites,positive

I truly liked this movie. One of the better Bond films for sure. Daniel Craig is a perfect choice to play Bond.,positive
The only movie where Bond looked human..,positive
"My first Bond film! I really enjoyed this movie and it makes me want to see more... I liked Craig's portrayal of a more ""human"" Bond. And the action sequences were pretty rad.",positive
"One of the better bond movies of all time. The plot, story, and especially dialogue, were phenomenal. The situations were also incredibly original. Just when I thought Bond was dead, Casino Royale proved me incorrect.",positive
"This is the way to make a Bond film. The Bond answer to Batman Begins, and in many ways better. Craig brings the Bond of the novels to life.",positive
but the ending sucked,positive
"The first action sequence is one of my favorites ever. The end of this movie leaves something to be desired - I wish it ended 15 minutes earlier, but the rest is freaking cool.",positive
"Best Bond movie, I really enjoyed the physicality of this new James Bond. I was very skeptical at first because of all the stupid comments that the previous Bond movies had in them.",positive
The new great bond has finally been found,positive
"A reboot to the series and starting off at the offical first book. This movie is everything the filmmakers wanted to create. Daniel Craig creates a hard-as-nails gentleman spy with Eva Green offering a perfect complicated love interest. The deep, modern-styled connections underlying the movie helps to make it modern but also connects will with the book and it's terrorist-funding aspects.",positive

not as good as most james bond films. the home of my ancestors is in this movie!,negative
1 OF MY FAVVVVV MOVIES!!!!!,positive
I really liked it. I should watch all the other double o seven vids so I could compare it.,positive
"The BEST Bond film ever made. My choice for the '06 Best Picture. Suspenseful and heartbreaking. Martin Campbell ('GoldenEye,' 'The Mask of Zorro') takes a page from Christopher Nolan's 'Batman Begins' and makes Bond realistic--no fancy gadgets here.",positive
best bond film i've ever seen.,positive
"I'm not a fan of James Bond, despite seeing most the movies & when I seen this guy I thought omg what a poor choice for 007, he looks like a rugby player and he'll never pull it off. How very wrong I was, IMO the best 007 in the best 007 Movie. This film really brings up to date what I always thought of as an old fashioned, pompus snob (lol 007 that is, not the actor playing him).",positive
Good to see 007 fall in love. Also fascinating to see Daniel Craig's performance when many people thought he was a bad choice to start with.,positive
daniel craig is actually a pretty convincing bond. eva green is a goddess.,positive
Half of the movie is a card game. Daniel Craig is a crappy Bond. A nerdy Bond girl. More swerves than every Connery movie combined. Shit that don't make sense. Recommendation to avoid.,negative
one of the few great remakes of a classic film. you can truly see the transformation of the character of bond.,positive
"Daniel Craig truly proves to be the best damn 007 since Connery. He and Green have fantastic chemistry, and this is a fantasticly realistic and serious take on James Bond.",positive
I like Judi Dench in the Bond flicks.,positive
"whats not to like? a super-cutie that kicks ass and his little bond girl, and did i mention how cute mr bond was this time?",positive
"Absolutely amazing. I was stunned, and pleasantly so. I can only hope this is how 007 will continue on.",positive
Like the new bond - not my complete favorite - not as smooth as Brosnan... The opening black and white sequence is awesome followed by the incredible footchase. I liked that it was a little longer than some of the others.,positive
"One of the best Bonds Oh & the beach resort on the Bahamas is the One & Only Ocean Club which, if it wasn't full of Americans, would be on my to go to list!",positive
Fave bond movie of all time and probably my fave movie ever.,positive
The best Bond movie I've ever seen.,positive
Love the fact that Bond keeps getting better. Sorry Timothy Dalton almost ruined it all.,positive
Potencial para ser una de las mejores pelis de accion ever.,positive
worst 007 movie ever,negative
"The first half of the movie didn't make any sense, the second half was better. Too much ""love-stuff"", though, a wierd ending, and I like Pierce Brosnan better!",negative
Thought this was fantastic! Loved the begining where they were up on the cranes,positive
Best James Bond that I have seen.,positive
I wanna be this guy!,positive
A whole lot better than I thought it would be.,positive
"My favourite Bond movie, while Daniel Craig could be the best Bond yet..?",positive
"Daniel Craig is a good new Bond, great opening sequence. Not a fan of the uberlove interest...when I think of Bond, I don't think of long term relationships.",positive
Mercenary.Close to the book...good dialogue and performance ...,positive
Daniel give a real good approach of the spy... I'm looking forward to see the next one!,negative
Daniel Craig...{{{wipes drool}}},positive
"This movie is one of the best 007 movies ever made and just so you know, the movie is based on the beginning of Bond.",positive
Very exciting film. Different from previous James Bond flicks as it had fewer gadgets and rougher fight scenes. Look forward to seeing Daniel Craig icy blue eyes in Golden Compass.,positive
Possibly the greatest Bond movie ever. Best opening credits ever. Most disturbing death scene ever (drowning).,positive
Back to being an assasin rather than a standing joke.,positive
Quite the astonishing action drama with the sultry edge that Bond films have always aspired.,positive
Cured me of Bond fatigue - easily one of the best of the series,positive
first time a Bond movie impressed me,positive
I love the origin idea. LOVED IT,positive
"james bond it dont matter whos playing him or what the plot is, james bond is always good",negative
Overly long falling-in-love sequence but the rest of the movie re-created the James Bond franchise. Keep it up.,positive
James Bond just got hot!,positive
"Really impressed with it, was more grown up than all of the stuff with peice brosnan in. Thought the way bond's character was explored was interesting in terms of why he turned out to be a womaniser with no heart lol. Not sure how they will follow it up without reverting back to the shiny action scenes that bond fans are used to.",positive
"Much more like it. Prefer Bond as a mesogynistic, smooth-talking bad-ass but thats just me. Thank god they kicked the old formula into next year.",positive
"Daniel Craig breathes life into the ""real James Bond"".",positive
"the most realistic bond movie ever but at the same time too down to earth for a super spy.....lol.......movie cud've done a bit better wiv the gadgets, but overall....a good one =D",negative
"yes, onnistunut 007 -leffa pitkÃ¤Ã¤n aikaan!",positive
Bond movies are starting to grow on me. Daniel Craig made the character more human and violent than ever before. Finally Bond movies are developing somewhere.,positive
my balls are itchy too,negative
"Another guy flick, enjoyed the action throughout but thought the bond girl could have been prettier. Think Daniel Craig is appropriately cast despite numerous objections.",positive
"Best bond movie, where's no Sean Connery. Daniel is the next best Bond.",positive
"Ok, I was expecting a lot more from this movie. Daniel Craig was really disappointing and the movie felt like it was reaalllyy long. It lasted way to long, but overall it was a good movie.",positive
This is the best bond movie I've seen. I usually get bored in bond movies to the point I can't finish them because they're endless action without a true story behind it. This one is action with thought all in one. Also the acting was great. I definitely reccommend this to others.,positive
amazing. thats the actor from journeyman.,positive
"This was shite. It was too violent, the plot made no sense whatsoever and in context (as the ""first"" film) it does not work.",negative
"Better than I thought it would be, but they loose a star for crashing the Austin Martin. WHY?!?! It was so beautiful!",positive
Daniel Craig is one of the best bonds for sure. One of my favorite bond films,positive
"As the newspaper reviews go: OMG, suddenly Bond is cool again. Too bad they couldn't have actually stuck to the book and TOTALLY retro'd it, but it's actually surprisingly close given the enormous generation gap.",positive
This is how James Bond should be. How can you not like a 45 minute long poker scene?,positive
It sucked to many storylines to follow,negative
"it was cool, but i wouldnt really wanna see it again.",negative
blue speedo at the beach amazing hardly anybody can pull off a speedo the way Craig does lol hahahahah,positive
"Great bond movie..no big hugev global threat, a nice small threat",positive
Two words: Watch IT! The re-imagining of the Bond line is just what the doctor ordered. the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat from the beginning to the end. Daniel Craig is just perfect for this role. Eva Green is smoking HOT! If you were as turned off as I was with the over the top gadgets of the last few bond films then this film will be your ticket back to being a fan.,positive
james bond movies are the best!,positive
"definitely a great movie.. intense action, so it's good if thats what you're looking for",positive
"great comeback to a lagging franchise, although I loved pierce brsonan, craig looks to be just as good or better.",positive
The running scene was cool...but Daniel Craig? I don't know...he's...too blonde and pouty.,negative
"Daniel Craig does a great job as Bond. Same Bond cliches with a new attitude. Well done, and definitely one of my favorite Bond films.",positive
Disappointed - I guess this is the first movie to try and change 007's direction. And I can play better cards than him...,negative
"This was the first James Bond movie that I watched completely from beginning to end. So, I'm not exactly a person well-versed in the Bond series. That being said, this movie was VERY well done. Great performences by Eva Green, Judi Dench (Love her!) but especially Daniel Craig, who fills the Bond shoes so nicely you forget it's his first time around. Great plot, and I know there weren't many gadgets or whatnot in this movie, but for me that worked just fine. I hope to watch other Bond movies soon.",positive
Daniel Craig is terrific as 007. He is the best Bond since Sean Connery and this is arguably the best film in the franchise.,positive
better than some of the newer bonds,negative
The first five minutes in black in white was very promising. Then it went to typical new bong crap. Judi Dench carried it for the first 30 minutes. Then it collapsed.,negative
"Great rebirth of the bond line. Great job from Dan Craig. He makes me want to wear a blue speedo at the beach, but I dont think it will have the same effect....",positive
"Confusing. Wants to be a newer, edgier bond, but still piles on Bond cliches like a on-car defibrillator.",negative
"this is the best bond film yet, i love that they made him more brutish and violent instead of the whole suave gadget crap",positive
"I don't care if he's blonde. who cares? He is the most badass and entertaining one to watch. Mix of chivalry and toughness. So intense, and gave us some more insight into bond. the first bond that is supposed to have a direct sequel related to the story line.",positive
One of my favorite movies of all time!,positive
i didnt know bond was gay......,negative
"One of the best films I've ever seen, it's just non stop!",positive
Daniel Craig is the best 007. period. amazing. see it. nuff said. can't wait for the new one.,positive
THE PERFECT MOVIE from all of 007' movies.,positive
Best Bond since Connery.,positive
Now this is an action film!,positive
Easily the best Bond film; the rest are mediocre at best.,positive
I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. Not the best of the Bond films but pretty good.,negative
Le meilleur James Bond jamais fait et aussi le meilleur film de 2006.,positive
"Too much poker, and why the hell did she kill herself at the end?",negative
"la mejor pelicula de bond, este man la bota es el mejor bond desde ke la vi me hice fanatico del poker",positive
This gives every 'codes' in James Bond the reason.,positive
"""How will you like your martini sir?"" ""Does it look like I give a damn?""",positive
"James Bond est sensÃ© Ãªtre invincible, James Bond est sensÃ© Ãªtre mÃ¢le, James Bond est sensÃ© Ãªtre ""trop trop fort"". Au final, On retiendra que Daniel Craig fait une performance plus qu'honorable, une course poursuite mÃ©morable en intro et une partie de poker trÃ¨s bien filmÃ©e.",negative
"OMFG my favorite movie everrr. Daniel Craig is an amazing actor, he plays James Bond reallly well. just overall great movie",positive
"Casino Royale is a darker and less gadget friendly James Bond movie. For once James Bond feels like a human being, instead of some superhero like he did when Pierce Brosnan was Bond. Daniel Criag was great. Eva Green was a good bond girl and Mads Mikkelsen was a great villian. I loved this movie, and this is coming from a person who is not a James Bond fan. The best Bond flick.",positive
Best.Bond.movie.ever. The only one I'll bother with.,positive
he did a better job than pierce and rodger etc. except sean connery,positive
"one of the better bond movies, but there was no Q like in all the others",positive
Le meilleur James bond de tous les temps! Enfin un vrai dur ki cogne sur tout ce ki bouge!,positive
"A great film, just not my idea of a bond film. Definately miss the gadgets.",negative
Best Bond movie in years!,positive
"Best Bond film since Thunderball. Daniel Craig is brillient, and finally the producers have got rid of the high-tech crap and CGI that plagued Brosnan's last two films. A very human Bond.",positive
best Bond movie yet. amazing sound track and the plot is awesome.,positive
the movie is too long...,negative
You mean Bourne-ified!,positive
blah. it started out cool with that guy jumping all around the place... he was amazing. but then it got worse,negative
Loved it-even though I don't get poker and had to keep asking Roger 'has he won?',positive
"While I'm still torn as to weather Timothy Dalton or Daniel Craig should top my own personal 'best Bond' list, Eva Green without a doubt the best Bond girl ever. Oh, the movie's pretty good too...",positive
another of my faves..hes hot as well.,positive
He's so hot and the films good too.,positive
"One of the better James Bond movies, made the rest of them make sense. Very clever. Wasn't too sure about Daniel Craig at first-but he acted it well.",positive
"In a word ""PWOAH"" just for Daniel Craig walking out of the sea!",positive
"Outstanding movie. Mr Craig ticks all the right boxes for what a Bond should be and I feel he has toppled Mr Connery's crown. No more silliness with regard to the gadgets plus a suggestion of emotional fragility (don't worry its only a suggestion). The fight scenes have a reality and authenticity about them that I cant remember seeing in previous bond movies. He's cool, calm, tough , ruthless and selfish a real mans man who gets the stunning girls and the job done, something us blokes secretly admire. Cant wait for the next one.",positive
Very Good James Bond!,positive
"Eka Bondi, josta tykkäsin :D",positive
"Really good adaptation of the Bond series. When I first saw it in theatres I said ""They've Batman Begins-ified Bond"", in other words they made Bond way more believable than invisible cars and a helicopter with optional chainsaw attachment.",positive
Daniel Craig is an awesome James Bond!!! Also I love the opening sequence to the title song...very slick animation!,positive
"very Nice, Great Actions",positive
"Great Bond movie, and gorgeous hot new Bond :D !",negative
Best bond film since Sean Connery retired.,positive
...blonde Bond? I can't get over it. 1 star for Chris Cornell doing the song.,negative
I finally like the Bond series now that Daniel Craig is leading the show!,positive
"First of all: I'm a Bond fan. Love Bond movies. Expected a lot from this one. Sat down, watched 15 minutes and thought 'Yes!!! This is going to be great.' From then on two things happen: a) nothing and b) Bond turns to a sniffling wuss. It would get a slightly higher rating from me if this was a new franchise. But within the Bond franchise: no, this is not what I want to see. Sign the petition: 'Let Bond be a tough and smart gentleman spy.'",negative
One of my favorite Bond movies ever. Daniel Craig was excellent. Possibly BETTER than Sean Connery. I said it.,positive
definitely a tribute to the end of the ian flemming based bond...(last novel used),positive
The opening chase scene is a tribute to French Parkour echoing Luc Besson's portrayal in District 13.,positive
Long but worth it. I can't wait to see what other installments Craig will do...,positive
Best...Movie...Ever...,positive
Best Bond Film in years!!,positive
"True to the novel as much as possible in a modern setting, and Craig turns in the best Bond since Connery. Loved it.",positive
It wasn't up to the standards of Jasson Bourne. It didn't have enough action.,negative
"I loved this movie. I've never been a Bond fan, but my husband dragged me to this one and I fell in love. Daniel Craig was amazingly hot and perfect as James Bond. This Bond seemed more like a ""real"" person and not some elitist who plays with non-existent futuristic technology. It's a sexy, fun movie. And Chris Cornell's theme song ""You Know My Name"" is an added bonus. ADD ON (12/8/07): Just watched this movie again. Daniel Craig IS James Bond. This movie is unbelievably good.",positive
"it was ok, not my favorite bond flim",negative
Best Bond film yet! Daniel Craig is second only to Roger Moore (oh no! I thought Daniel Craig better than Sean Connery! ) I look forward to a Bond Renaissance.,positive
"Craig isn't the man I would imagine to be debonair Bond, but the movie's plot wasn't so bad.",negative
I think I am the only person who misses Pierce,negative
"<3 Daniel Craig. I don't CARE if he's got a daughter my age, he's addictive.",positive
james bond. need i say more?,positive
"Gledelig overraskelse etter stadig mer parodiske Bond-filmer de siste Ã¥rene. Bond framstÃ¥r nÃ¥ som en moderne agent, fremdeles tÃ¸ffere enn de fleste, men uten alt det utdaterte tÃ¸vet om ermet fullt av fikse oppfinnelser, ristet Martini og smÃ¥ironiske gentlemanfakter. Historien er forvirrende, med mange overflatiske rollefigurer, og den hopper vel fort fra det ene til det andre. Men den blir i hverfall aldri kjedelig! Det er jo ogsÃ¥ litt rÃ¸rende med en kjÃ¦rlighetshistorie midt i all volden og kynismen, selv om jeg har litt vondt for ""Ã¥ kjÃ¸pe"" Bonds plutselige helomvending i fÃ¸lelseslivet. Men noe sier meg at dette blir siste gang, for tÃ¸ffe mannlige fans som fÃ¥r lyst til Ã¥ begynne Ã¥ grine over Bonds myke sider.",negative
I really enjoyed this film.,negative
Very impressed with Daniel Craig's Bond,positive
"Really good adaptation of the Bond series. When I first saw it in theatres I said ""They've Batman Begins-ified Bond"", in other words they made Bond way more believable than invisible cars and a helicopter with optional chainsaw attachment.",negative
Hopefully this is Daniel Craig's LAST Bond Movie. He has no on screen presence,negative
"Daniel Craig is an awesome bond!! Awesome movie, nothing bad to say about it",positive
So good I had to do some free style running after,positive
good theme song and i like the cast,negative
BEST JAMES BOND SO FAR,positive
Definitly the best Bond ever - it's the first Bond that could almost be real,positive
"As a reboot, it works... but I don't think it can save the Bond franchise. I still prefer Bourne.",negative
My ass still hurts from this movie kicking it,positive
Fantastic. Puts the others to shame. And i was already a Bond fan!,positive
"James Bond is a hard name to live up to... my hat comes off to you Daniel Craig, nice job",positive
"The blonde Bond certainly makes an impact, suberb film and as for that scene in those little trunks......mmmm!!!",positive
suprisingly awesome. best bond movie ever.,negative
"The name's Bond, James Bond...",positive
"One of the better 007 movie to come out in a long time. It was a good Drama, not just a typical bond gadget film. See him as a little more human!",positive
Started off really well and then it just fizzled,negative
Best Bond movie since Goldeneye.,positive
"i was skeptical prior too seeing it. i have been a tremendous bond fanatic since i can remember, and wasn't too well with the thought of a brosnan replacement...flash forward to the present! this daniel guy is an ass kicker.",positive
"Oubliez les James Bond superhÃ©ros dans des dÃ©cors kitsch de base secrÃ¨te avec des annonces au haut-parleur qui veulent rien dire, des types en pyjama rouge, des consoles qui clignotent comme des sapins de Noel et des mÃ©chants avec des chats sur les genoux! James Bond est enfin un humain (enfin presque).",positive
my name is bond... james bond,positive
Finally a Bond movie that's actually good. Here's the real Bond from the books.,positive
"When i first heard they were casting Daniel Craig as Bond I wasn't happy. I didn't think he looked the part and I didn't think anyone could live up to the franchise like Pierce Brosnan did. Boy was i wrong. Not only did Craig pull Bonds attitude and coolness off, he's also the most physicllly active Bond yet, doing martial arts and chasing guys through construction sites on foot. Great movie and looking forward to more of Daniel Craig as James Bond.",positive
Best Bond movie yet.,positive
"IndÃ©niablement un des meilleurs James Bond depuis l'Ã¨re Connery, en tant qu'oeuvre de cinÃ©ma bien sÃ»r (scÃ©nario, rÃ©alisation)... que l'on aime ou non Daniel Craig...",positive
breathed new life into the franchise,negative
"Awesome movie, just don't tell anyone I said so.",positive
dunno on the new bond ??,positive
"A different James Bond, but good different! I love it!",positive
"Daniel Craig is the first James Bond after Sean Connery,and unlike Connery, this Bond is a much more sophisticated character than the clichÃ© that James Bond created.",positive
beyond Connery - this is the real Bond!,positive
"No me gusto, un Bond en esteroides, sin clase.. post 9/11 nah nah..",negative
What a relief the producers have finally returned to the more introspective (I'd almost say human) Bond that Fleming created in his novels. One of the better Bond movies.,negative
"Wow. I've been a bond fan since I was a kid and this movie flies in the face of every tradition that made bond movies great. And it the best Bond film I've ever seen, and I've seen all of them. 20 minutes of sappy love story cost it the perfect score",positive
"The scene where the car flipped, that was the world record for most tumbles done.",negative
"I was surprised by this movie. I didn't think I would like it and didn't think I'd like the ""new Bond"" but I do!",positive
"The only Bond movie I genuinely, unironically like.",negative
First Bond movie I've ever seen. I liked the parkour worked in.,positive
"This is the best of the James Bond movies.. even better than the Connery ones. Unlike all the other Bonds he manages to make Bond seem like a real person, showing his vulnerabilities as well as the brutal violence of his job. Unlike the other Bonds who practically seemed superhuman.",positive
"A GREAT FILM 4 THE BEST BOND so wat if hes blond so am i, gotta problem bout that?",positive
loved it big time. and im not usually a bond fan at all...must be the blue shorts.,positive
best Bond-movie!! U have to c it on big screen. Maybe I gotta buy bluray just to experience this at home ....,positive
Two words. Daniel. Craig.,negative
Daniel Craig is great James Bond. Good adaption of the book.,positive
"Daniel Craig should have played a villian. Not sure why he is Bond, I didnt really like the movie.",negative
10/10 Daniel Craig Excellent start as 007,positive
"this guy is fab, love him!",positive
Best Bond movie ever. Craig is awesome.,positive
"The best bond yet - an amazing opening sequence, a hero with feeling and two really good looking women. What more could a man want?",positive
"The first and last Bond movie I'll ever see. This is 2 hours built around the concept of ""Let's see Bond play poker!"" B O R I N G",negative
"Very good film, cant see way they had to go right back to the beginning tho",positive
"I remember nothing about this film. Well, there was a parking lot, some gambling, and a near-death experience where Bond's heart stopped. Other than that, I wasn't paying attention.",negative
"Some chasing scenes, especially the one in the beginning, are unnecessarily long. And the in-movie-advertisements suck.",negative
DANIEL CRAIG IS SUCH A STUD,positive
my favorite part is the incredible design of the title sequence. holy crap.,negative
"Very different Bond, darker and sadly less gadgets. Craig is good, but Mads ""Fischer"" Mikkelsen is excellent.",positive
anyone who knows me knows why this movie got a high score.,negative
"Daniel Craig will grow into the role quite nicely. I expect big things Mr. Craig. BIG, like the size of Bond's swollen testicles.",positive
Good Bond film. They dropped the cheese and added grit. I like the makeover.,positive
"A really good movie. A really good Bond, Daniel Craig you da man. Excellent Special effects and action to the max. And a nice twist..and finally we understand why Bond doesnt commit to any women he meets. Recommend you see this movie via Blu-ray with 5.1 DTS for the full 007 experience.",positive
Not the best Bond flick: the card game was just too dull.,negative
best Bond movie ever.,positive
"So good. Kind of a really weird torture scene, I kinda wanted to laugh and be squeamish at the same time. Also weird to see Bond drive a Ford. Kick ass in general though",positive
Lo mejor de James Bond,positive
"Was cool, better than Brosnan! Well done :)",positive
Love it. Am a great James Bond fan. But was slightly disappointed with Danial Craig after the last James Bond,positive
i fell asleep all three of the times I watched it,negative
Bond was cooler when he played baccarat.,positive
It's The best Movie ever.,positive
one of the best bond movies,positive
Excellent for Daniel Craigs first attempt at James Bond. I can't wait to see him in the next Bond film!,positive
One of the best Bond movies in 20 years. No stupid humour included like michael-knight-haired Pierce Brosnan had.,positive
"This is my favorite bond movie. maybe it's a generational thing, but i never really got into the other Bond films. The only Bond related item I liked was Goldeneye for the N64. But this is a great movie. Bond is actually treated like a spy and he is a truly great character in this movie. We see what turns him into what he will become. The action is great. More specifically, the fight scenes. They are tough ass, hard hitting fight scenes. Those alone make this movie worth watching, adding the great story, beautiful locations, the best Bond from Craig, and the hottest Bond girl. What I think makes this so good is it is treated like a movie, not like another Bond film. I really like this movie. Freaking great. <br/> <br/>9.5 out of 10.",positive
"The Bond franchise stripped of its cheese and dashed with a hearty helping of badassery with a pinch of parkour. Fan-fucking-tastic. He's no Connery, though.",positive
EXCITING. ALL I CAN VIVIDLY REMEMBER IS THE CHAIN SCENE. OUCH!!!,positive
Had low expectation of this but it turned out to be really good..I like the serious Bond..Timothy Dalton is my fav Bond ...Daniel Craig did a good job,positive
Torture scene + Daniel Craig stripped naked <3,negative
"I only got halfway through this movie. First, because I couldn't get past the nagging lament that Brosnan is no longer Bond. Now I know how the Sean Connery devotees felt. The second reason is that the bond girl reminded my of my ex. That last one was just the excuse I needed to go do something else.",negative
"Thank god they've got rid of Pierce Brosnan! A return to a decent bond film after that string of dross in the 90s. Still requires much suspension of disbelief, but an very enjoyable, fast paced film with a excellent James Bond.",positive
"Not usually into Bond, but this definately kept me interested",negative
"What can you say? Aside from Sean Connery, Daniel Craig is the best person to play Bond.",positive
"Ehh. I saw it and it wasn't the best. Daniel craig is really poor bond if only because he looks ridiculous. He'd be great in a lord of the rings movie with those pointy ears of his he'd definitely be an elf. The movie was overlong, and poker is a horribly boring game to watch. That being said it had one of the best lines ever. ""Now the whole world will know you died scratching my balls!"" classic.",negative
I'm not a James Bond fan at all but actually enjoyed this movie a lot. Bond is human (finally) not just a guy all over the place in a tuxedo that doesn't know how to show off all his gadgets...That is boring! Daniel Craig is a great Bond.,positive
this is the best james bond ever,positive
"Daniel Craig is great as Bond, and the movie is a step away from the gadget-fixation of the previous ones. Really great.",positive
"awesome file, watch it!",positive
"My favorite bond movie ever. Music is great, chicks are hot (especially the one that looks like Cuddy from HOUSE) and the action scenes are phenominal. In fact, I think I'll watch it right now...",positive
"I am bias in the fact that I'm a massive 007 fan, and Bond is my favorite movie franchise, however Casino Royale has to be up there with the best Bond movies. Craig puts in an excellent performance which has re-energised a tired franchise. Breathtaking action sequences that firmly put Bond back on top.",positive
"Good film, undecided on Craig, though he was good.",negative
ok but certainly not great as bond movies go. I think I'll like Daniel Craig though,negative
Best Bond film since the sixties.,positive
"Good movie, and i like the opeaning credits",positive
A darker Bond! Love it!,positive
I don't care that it's James Bond. It was brilliant! And it was definitely helped along by the delicious Daniel Craig. Best Bond EVER? Yup!,positive
The best bond by far....,positive
"Best Bond film to date in my opinion. Great action, but not ridiculous, great story, and finally an origin story for Bond becoming 007. Go see it if you haven't.",positive
Since Sean Connery...this was the best action intense Bond movie ever. No Gadgets...just action.,positive
"this one was not bad, but i still think the Pierce B. was a better bond and i think Sean Connery is the all time best",positive
"As a general rule, I do NOT like Daniel Craig, but I was pleasantly surprised at how this one turned out, considering the novel of the same name, by definition, blows.",negative
A lot like GoldenEye in that it breathes new life into the franchise and gives it a fresh new look and start.,positive
My favorite James Bond movie yet.,positive
"Paras bondi. Piste. Juoni on toimiva ja tunnelma on kokonaisuudessan synkempi kuin aiemmissa Bondeissa. Daniel Craig onnistuu roolissaan tosi hyvin, eikÃ¤ Eva GreenkÃ¤Ã¤n jÃ¤Ã¤ pahasti varjoon. Ainoa mikÃ¤ leffassa jÃ¤Ã¤ harmittamaan, on onnettoman lyhyeksi jÃ¤Ã¤nyt takaa-ajo Aston Martin DB9:llÃ¤ :( SitÃ¤ olisi katsellut pidempÃ¤Ã¤nkin.",positive
solid action and drama. probably the most satisfying Bond movie I've seen since Roger Moore!,positive
for reasons not of the movies fault i will not watch this again,negative
"I was violently opposed to watching this movie - having hated James Bond movies since my conception. And I thought Daniel Craig (though having seen him perform awesomely in Layer Cake) was an odd choice. My love and vote were with Clive Owen (he's not too old!). HOWEVER...I found myself engrossed in it - despite the pile of homework I was buried in. Not a huge fan of poker or casinos, but I dug how visceral and physical this Bond was.",negative
"I wanted to hate this film. I wanted one more film with Brosnan and from what I hear that isn't out of the realm of possibility since Craig is booked on other things for a while. The action scenes are amazing. The early chase seen was unbelievable. Casino was the first in a series of books so you get to see how Bond becomes Bond. I would have liked it more if they were true to the nostalgia. Old cars, old clothes and if they shot most of it in B&W that would have been awesome.",negative
"Never been into James Bond before, but this was a smashing film to watch, and what can you say bout Daniel Craig?! AWESOME",negative
Daniel Craig breathes new life into a tired series. First Bond movie I liked enough to see twice.,positive
LOVED this! Can't wait for the next one..I hear it releases VERY soon!! CANT WAITTTT!!,positive
How James Bond should be.,positive
Slower than most JB movies...,negative
Oh my freakin Daniel Craig. what a gorgeous Bond. and the poker is incredible. So well played but not over the top unrealistic. actually my first Bond movie too and I loved it.,positive
"A bond movie that wasn't loaded with gadgets, very refreshing to see.",positive
Ding Dong...beach scene with Mr Craig must be every girls dream ;),positive
"One of the most un-Bond like films of the Bond series, but arguably one of the best! Craig plays the role brilliantly, a lot more serious and (dare I say) rugged Bond, not too different from Daltons, but the character is a lot more believable. Considering most of the films set in a casino, as a NON-gambler the jist of the film isn't lost. The action scenes were also darker and more believable than in the previous films. Definately one of the best Bonds in years.",positive
Daniel Craig - the best bond (after Sean),positive
Too gritty. I miss Sean Connery!,positive
"When I was buying this recently, my husband asked me if we would really watch it enough to justify owning it. Umm--hell yeah.",positive
Like so many others i was very scepticle about this film. Also annoyed that Pierce had been replaced. I have to say i really loved it. It was very refreshing from the previous Bond films. I enjoyed how there was an explanation to the character of Bond. Gives you a greater sense of understanding and appreciation for the character.,positive
Best James Bond movie I ever watched.....Daniel Crag is excellent!,positive
"Ok, ok, I admit it. I was a member of ""Danielnot Bond.com"" prior to the film being released. I have since pleaded total ignorance in recognition of the best Bond since Connery, although he should stick to swim shorts not speedoes, the smug git.",positive
I can't stand James Bond but this was actually okay. Probably because there wasn't that many gadgets and he didn't have an invisible car,negative
Daniel Craig is the best bond yet! Right up there with Sean!,positive
The movie that gave Bond his balls back.,positive
"Yllätyin positiivisesti, vaikka loppua kohti kävi hieman puuduttavaksi.",negative
"Esta para mi ha sido de las mejores o la mejor pelicula del 007, muestra a un James Bond creible y sin lo churrero y colgado que suelen ser las otras.",positive
"Daniel Craig was much better than expected, and the movie was simply one of the best in the series!",positive
Den nye Bond klarer jobben!,positive
"very good action packed,better than i expected",positive
Daniel Craig is the best James bond yet.,positive
"Probably my #2, if not favorite 007 movie ever. And yes, Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery, and the truest to Fleming's original character.",positive
one of the best bond films. daniel craig is awesome,positive
quite a beautifully shot movie...amazing locations.,negative
"New Bond, great ""re-invent"" of the series.",positive
Much better than I expected. Daniel Craig grows on you after awhile.,negative
"For me this wasnt the best of the bond movies (Goldeneye) and it wasnt the worst of the bond movies (die another day). Daniel Craig proved he has what it takes to be a great bond, even with the blonde hair. I guess for me I wish there had been a few bond gadgets. hopefully when they make the next bond with Daniel Craig they add a few. Then it would be perfect. till then Goldeneye will be the best of all the bonds.",positive
"Best Bond since Goldeneye, and is probably better. I was disappointed when they didn't get Clive Owen, but Daniel Craig erased all my fears.",positive
I think this 007 one is not too exaggerate. it's quite a real life.,positive
Nice to see james bond having to work hard :),positive
Craig puts the badass back in Bond. No more cartoonish Brosnan effects. Thank God.,positive

"Thought it would be stupid, but turned out actually good.",positive
My favorite James Bond. Nothing like 007 of the past. The torture scene is brutal,positive
James Bond has finally returned,positive
"Daniel Craig beats any Bond yet. He is Bond, James Bond. This movie was spectacular, and takes out everything that made the past few movies bad: Those stupid gadgets. We get it, but he doesn't need an invisible car or whatever the hell else. This Bond bleeds, and is one angry man. And it's perfect to tell just how he got where he is.",positive
daniel craig is amazing,positive
"good movie, probably the best james bond i've seen. still didn't love it. probably for me is more of a rent than a buy.",positive
the best james bond i've seen...daniel craig looks like the real agent..,positive

"Debut of a new 007, and he is brilliant",positive
Craig is born to be Bond. He is just what Bond must have been in the beginning of his career. One of the best James Bond movies ever done.,positive
I've seen most Bond films and this is by far my favourite. David Craig is phenomenal and it doesn't hurt that the theme song is one of my all-time favourites as well.,positive
Bond came back with this movie.,positive
"Daniel Craigs Bond is a total thug, nice change.",positive
"Best Bond I've seen in ages. Nice flow in it - apart from the ""playing poker in the casino"" scene - which is quite long and boring. Funny thing really - since you would anticipate that such a scene indeed would need to be god, remembering the title of the flick.",negative

"When the decision was taken in 2005 to press the reset button on the Bond series I was not surprised, this cinematic institution had back itself into a wall, the previous instalment in 2002 was a typical globe trotting gadgets laden farce of a film and subsequently current Bond Pierce Brosnan's final mission in the role. The film celebrated the films 40th anniversary with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer but it was the C.G.I para-surfing and invisible car that showed that time needed to be called on this type of thing. Back in 1999 Barbara Broccoli and her step brother Michael G Wilson had finally secured the filming rights to Ian Fleming's first Bond novel Casino Royale, Having settle a rights dispute the film was now in a position to be made by EON productions the official Bond film production company run by Brocoli and Wilson. The book had been previously filmed back in 1967 directed by a total of 6 people including John Huston at one point, the film has gained cult status over the years but bears no relation to the original series or Fleming's novel for that matter. This being Fleming's first Bond story the makers needed to make a decision would they retool this to fit an older more experienced 007 or was it time to let the current actor go and search for new talent to take on the role. While the idea of rebooting a series may sound common place now back in 2005 it had been attempted rarely but the idea was on the radar especially as Warner Brothers had rather successfully relaunched the Batman franchise earlier that year. The film while not a monster (that would be its sequel) was a big enough success to secure the opportunity for more, it stole the thunder that summer from George Lucas' final Star Wars prequel Revenge Of The Sith but more importantly appeared to wipe the memory of the hole that Joel Schumacher had dug for the series back in 1997 with the atrocious Batman & Robin. This is not to say that Brosnan final film had been a disaster it was clearly liked by the public having been at that point the most lucrative film of the series. Though the reboot option was one way to start again plus the advent of the Bourne films had changed audiences expectations of what to expect from the spy genre and also 9/11's impact can not be underestimated as a factor into why films took a darker direction in the 21st century. Back in 1995 it seemed that EON had tried to change things with Goldeneye the film did seem different to what had previously been but it was business as usual when Brosnan returned 2 years later in Tomorrow Never Dies, it was like Roger Moore never left (this is not a compliment), The series had been ridiculed by the likes of the Austin Powers franchise and the next three entries starring the Irish man seemed to be completely oblivious to this, appearing as farcical as those parodies. Could a noughties audience really take this version of the character serious again? If James Bond was to appear relevant again he would need a serious remodelling so when Broccoli and wilson announced in 2005 that they'd found their new Bond and that they would be bring Fleming's celebrated first Bond novel to the screen with Goldeneye director Martin Campbell returning to take the helm with the reset button pressed, the expectation was huge and things didn't begin too successfully to start with. Daniel Craig a critically acclaimed stage and screen actor who had been bought to the public's attention in 1996 when he appeared in the BBC adaptation of Peter Flannery's masterful Our Friends In The North alongside future Doctor Who Christopher Eccleston and rising star Mark Strong. Craig then settled into a series of roles in acclaimed drama appearing alongside Derek Jacobi's Francis Bacon in Love and the Devil, Roger Mitchel's controversial The Mother and playing Ted Hughes alongside Gwyneth Paltrow in Sylvia. Craig also flirted with blockbusters with a supporting role alongside Angelina Jolie in the first Tomb Raider movie. Although it was been cast in Mathew Vaughn's gangster flick Layer Cake that brought him to a bigger audience and also caught the attention of Brocoli who believed she'd found her Bond. Craig's announcement wasn't received that favourably, the brick bats were out pretty quickly, the tabloids voiced their disapproval and a web site craigsnotbond was set up where Bond fans could voice their concern of his appointment, too short, too ugly and too blonde were comments that were bandied about at the time. Craig certainly wasn't typical of what had previously been seen in the role, his looks while to some immediately set up as a global sex symbol were to some just not good enough to play their super spy (incidentally many of these were male). Although what Craig did have was a strong dramatic background. EON wanted to dispense with what had gone before and felt for their new Bond they needed something far more serious that what had gone before, the attempt to make Bond more likes Fleming's character with Timothy Dalton in 1987-89 had not gone down well with the public despite Dalton's terrific but brief time in the role, the time hadn't been right for a gritty Bond. EON felt now in the 21st century some 17 years later that now they would be. The thing that strikes you about Casino Royale is that it feels like a proper film, not some cookie cutter entry in an on going series with the usual tick the box antics that audiences had just come to expect, no sense of drama or thrill it was obvious Bond was going to get out of whatever predicament he was in. Royale presented Bond as a newly minted 00 who in the pre title sequence of the film in monochrome black and white (a series first) in Prague would be introduced performing his second kill to earn his status while we flash back to him performing the first one, Craig's Bond informs Dryden (Malcolm Sinclair) a corrupt government official who seems unruffled until he realises Bond is cementing his 00 credentials as him as his second kill as he intones nervously ""made you feel it did he?"" Cutting back to Bond in a brutal punch up in a bathroom with an assailant. The scene switches back as Dryden says "" ...you needn't worry. The second is-- "" Craig cutting Dryden sentence short with a single silenced gun shot followed with a witty quip, "" Yes Considerably"" Craig immediately announcing his presence in the role. We cut back to the bathroom as the assailant goes to shoot Bond as we get the camera view of him looking straight at us and shooting his target as the scene dissolves into a familiar sight as the colour bleeds in as the opening credits begin. The producers choosing wisely not to begin traditionally as all the Bond films since 1962's Dr No with the gun barrel sequence as we are clearly witnessing Bond begins, instead having Daniel Kleinman incorporate into the titles a redesigned gun barrel, kleinman having grabbed the baton with aplomb back in 1995 from series titles legend the late great Maurice Binder, here Kleinman delivers his best and most striking titles to date using the card theme of the story. Soundgarden's Chris Cornell and David Arnold co written title song ""You Know My Name"" while not being a instant classic is definitely the best since Bono and the Edge penned Goldeneye theme sung by Tina Turner, the title of the song announcing the arrival of the new Bond with a real fan fare. The second half of the film would pretty much be a straight adaptation of Fleming's novel, the first half being original material written by Bond regulars Neil Purvis and Robert Wade with some polish been applied by Oscar winning director and writer Paul Haggis. We have brief introduction to our villian Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) as well as shadowy operative from an unknown organisation Mr White (Jesper Christensen) as details of a sinister stock market transaction are revealed, then we fling into a break neck pursuit sequence in Madagascar (actually Abandoned Motel, Coral Harbour, New Providence Island, Bahamas) with Craig's Bond pursuing a terrorist bomb maker Mollka, real life Parkour expert Sebastian Foucan, Foucan's skill adding an extra dimension to the chase sequence. After witnessing a Bond who for most of the time can't get around without the help of some gadget or other it refreshing to see Craig's Bond go at full throttle, the new post 9/11 007 a real physical presence if not a tad reckless. This new Bond is not the Bond we all know and love just yet, the idea that Purvis and Wade would introduce him as not quite the finished article, even Arnold's score would tease small amounts of the Bond theme (although not played in full till the end) to signify each time he Bond earned one of his stripes. Craig's Bond would appear impulsive and after being told by M (a returning Judi Dench) to go and bury his head after his altercation with Moloka ending in a hasty execution which unfortunately for M & Bond his documented by the worlds press. This being Bond never one to fade into the background with the Intel he acquires heads to The Bahamas. The idea of Bond's actions causing a scandal the Bond of old would seem to cause havoc with no real accountability, the writers inserting somewhat of a more real world feel than previous instalments. Craig said he watched all the previous entries for preparation for the role and then promptly forgot them. Although he presents a new interpretation of the character, there are little subtle nods to Connery and even Moore. Bond using the opportunity of been mistaken for a valet at his hotel in the Bahamas to obtain surveillance to further his investigations has more than a hint of Sean and when he says to the receptionist "" What if I felt compelled to"" echoes a touch of Sir Roger. Arnold teases a little of the theme out as Bond wins a vintage Aston Martin DB5 from the next suspect on his list Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian). Purvis and Wade's script touches on the literary Bond's penchant for married women, the ease of the seduction of Dimitrios' wife Solange (Caterina Murino). The film offering a welcome touch of dialogue and intrigue before Bond ends up in Miami foiling the destruction of the Skyfleet airliner in an action packed chase sequence, setting up Le Chiffre's being forced to set up a high stakes poker game to retain the money of the client he has just lost on his rather risky venture foiled by Bond. Setting up the events that would pick up Fleming's novel for the duration of the film. Murino's Solange is more typical Bond girl material although Vesper Lynd is probably the most significant female in Bond's life and evolution. Eva Green charged with the job of bringing to life on the screen establishing her relationship with Bond with a rather spiky introduction, her obvious cynicism in Bond's mission. A credit to the writers and director Campbell as the rather mundane idea of a poker match is made a tense experience interspersed with some drama and a brutal hand to hand combat. Craig and Mikkelsen spark off each other with a game of one-upmanship leading to the famous torture sequence detailed in Fleming's novel, apart from some black humour inserted this is pretty much to the letter of the book with some minor adjustments. The events of the conclusion of the book are played down with Vesper's fate but it would be churlish to expect EON to go the same route with their climax, the sinking house sequence has caused much division among fans and critics. I for one are more of a fan of this than the watered down Raiders of The Lost Ark truck sequence in the Miami segment of the film. It was always going to be the case that this moment was never going to as subtle as the book, the series was being relaunched and this was supposed to be the most significant moment that starts to mould the new Bond into the fully formed 007 and the big emotional climax was the way to go. These films are not made for a small percentage of fan boys who's wet dream scenario's would most likely have no bearing on the general public, these films are made for a mass audience and they weren't going to let their re-booted franchise go out on a whimper. It is also an imaginative sequence that also incorporates a big emotional and significant climax for Bond. Of course thing were not going to end with Bond down and out and the epilogue see's a suited and booted Daniel Craig finally get to utter the famous line in a brief but big moment with Arnold letting rip finally with the fully fledged Bond theme to close proceedings which also sets up the first full blooded sequel of the series history as the sign off tantalises of what is to come. Casino Royale is not perfect no Bond film is, the Miami sequence of the film could have been handled with something more than a generic chase sequence, it seems a little pale after the inventive parkour pursuit. Like most Bond films the script is not perfect (although better than anything seen in the series for decades), yes there are clunkers, an unforgivable piece of blatant product placement in the Bond/Vesper introduction which brings an otherwise great scene to a halt. Despite some attempt to include some subtle dry wit for the most part the little finger line would be more welcome in a Carry On flick and is as juvenile as the puerile lines in the Moore and Brosnan era. It's unclear who's to blame while Purvis and Wade had their critics and are no script writing gods it's possible Haggis is responsible although he probably lent the film the dramatic weight it needed. This David Arnold's fourth score, while most likely the best work he's produced to this point it still feels wanting, he makes good use of alternative arrangements of his and Cornell's title theme, he creates an emotional Vesper theme and seems to cope enough without having his usual safety net of the JB theme to lean on. Although at times his score just seems to be just pounding percussion with no melody and we hit an all time low when he lets loose with the blaring brass that would be more welcome in the Austin Powers franchise when the Skyfleet plane is unveiled in the Miami sequence, marring an already problem sequence of the film. Would this film have been better with a John Barry score? Of course it would, when you consider the substandard entries that Connery and Moore were afforded Barry musical gold and Daniel Craig gives more to the role than any actor in the series history and he's rewarded with Mr Arnold trying. These things aside this arguably the best entry since 1969's On Her Majesty Secret Service, choosing Martin Campbell to helm once again after he successfully did in 1995 this time getting a proper actor rather the then TV actor Brosnan. In Daniel Craig we have found an actor who has added dramatic weight unlike Pierce he approaches the role with no awe or fan boy wonder, just wanting to do an impressive job, never raising to any of the criticism flying around while this was being filmed just quietly getting on with the job and spectacularly proving people wrong who questioned his appointment a year before. He also cuts an impressive figure filling out the tux like no other actor since Sean Connery and getting as close to that panther strut that personified the Scots man in 1962. While his critics will baulk he hasn't the confidence of Connery's 007, at this point he's not supposed to . This a newly introduced Bond the films have never approached the character from this point before, it's always been an established agent, with this re-boot option we are getting to see Bond earn his stripes and although we are seeing this here it's obvious this Bond is still learning. While Connery's 007 in 1963 From Russia With Love set the bench mark for the definitive fully fledged Bond, Craig's is the most impressive all out performance of any actor in the series to date and hints at a bright future for this enduring character.",positive
best bond movie. daniel craig fits the character well. robert moore and sean connery were girly compared to this dude.,positive
Best JB movie after SC's series!,positive

"Well, itâs that time again for yet another Bond film, and this time it marks the arrival of a new guy to don the famous secret agentâs tuxedo. Unless youâve hid under a rock for the past year, you will no doubt know that we are of course talking about Daniel Craig â the most controversially cast actor in cinema history. And the film in question is Casino Royale, a film that marks a âback to basicsâ approach to the franchise â so no invisible cars here then. But as soon as this new look Bond begins, you know thereâs something different. This Bond is meaner, tougher and much rougher than previous incarnations and the casting of Craig is so exquisitely chosen you canât think of any other actor who would better him. Daniel Craig is quite simply one of the best Bonds, dare I say this, ever. With Eva Green as the mysterious and beautiful âBond Girlâ and Mads Mikkelsen as the evil, asthmatic, poker playing villain, the cast fit beautifully into their roles. Words cannot describe how well this film has been directed and how brilliant the script is through out. Martin Campbell, who returns to the franchise after his introduction of Pierce Brosnan in 1995âs Goldeneye, could easily accept this as his greatest achievement of his career, and the three script writers who were involved in the film all deserve a good pat on the back for a wonderfully written film (Bartender: Shaken or stirred? Bond: Does it look like I give a damn?). Even the edits between scenes using a simple fade during the casino scenes hark back to the classic films such as From Russia with Love and Goldfinger. Even the much criticised âYou Know My Nameâ title theme is better than you might think. But the tune goes especially well with the absolutely outstanding opening title credits. Weâre talking Oscar winning stuff here. Now the good points are out of the way, letâs discuss where the filmâs flaws lie. You could say its problems lie in its lack of âBondianâ moments, because with the Bond theme saved until the end credits and no Q or Moneypenny, it can upset some. However, this factor makes the whole film feel fresh and new, and I really canât remember a time when a Bond film felt like that. The reserved Bond theme until the end also makes the finale 100 times better, giving us the best end to a film for years. Yet the film can drag at points, and then liven up at other parts. There is something else that distracts me in this film; however, I cannot put a finger on it. Whatever it is, it certainly doesnât affect the film as a whole. Overall, this is easily one of the best Bond films of the modern era.",positive

"An action packed film in which I love so much. I had my doubts about Daniel Craig portraying James Bond, as everyone else did. But after I saw the movie I thought that he did a wonderful job, and that he fit the role perfectly.",positive
A good first JB film For Danny C. The best JB is still Sean Connery though. But please watch this. I have about 4-5 times.,positive
"The best Bond film since Sean Connery was wearing the tux. Craig is absolutely fantastic as 007. He's cool, funny when the script calls for it and knows how to kick some serious ass. But the best part of this movie is the plot--more specifically, the fact that there actually is one. No more relying on fancy gadgets and huge explosions to sell the story. I'm looking forward to seeing where Craig and the gang take Bond from here, because they've set the bar very high.",positive
"As with Batman Begins, this movie breathes new life into a slumping franchise. Story-driven rather than gadget-driven!",positive
"[img]http://cdn-2.nflximg.com/us/boxshots/large/70021642.jpg[/img] [size=4][color=red][b]Batman Begins (2005)[/b][/color][/size] This movie was a very positive move in the Batman franchise. With all the previous Batman movies (with the original being an exception) seeming to be kid-oriented or catered to a retard audience this was definitely a fresh crisp relief. The movie just plain rocks. We are back to a more rugged, gory and dark version of the person behind the mask. This is serious business, not kids play. [img]http://cdn-4.nflximg.com/us/boxshots/large/70044604.jpg[/img] [size=4][color=red][b]Casino Royale (2006)[/b][/color][/size] While I never found the Pierce Brosnan Bond movies horrible this is definitely a much more enjoyable personification of James Bond. This is supposedly the very first Bond film in the series that explains who/what Bond is and why he never in the future becomes attached to a woman emotionally. Casino Royale departs from the other movies in going back to its roots where you have Bond acting the fierce fighter role. The ""badass"" role.

Matt Damon is one of my more favorite actors since his performance in Good Will Hunting. All three movies are fast, action paced, adrenilin flowing edge-of-your-couch thrill-rides. While I particularly don't like the shaky camera-action during action scenes that seems to have plagued quite a few movies in the last several years it only partially distracts from the plot of the movie or from what is happening on screen. Enjoy this trilogy.",positive

"This was a different Bond to most of the others - edgier, darker and sets up Bond for the rest of the Bond series. For a first-time actor and story, this delivers the goods.

"Not the finest Bond movie - that accolade goes to From Russia With Love - but this comes a close second. Dispensing with the novelty element of the last few 007 films,director Martin Campbell takes us back to the Bond of the books - a brutal, cynical killer. Craig is expertly cast in the role. If you like this, then try Licence To Kill - Tim Dalton's second - and final outing - as the super-spy.

Although some points of this film (the love story especially) could have been summerized without losing any important plot, I think Casino Royal does a superb job of granting insight to what makes the Bond character tick. The action scenes are intense and well-shot. The scenary is gorgeous. The gadgets are great. Most importantly, the tongue in cheek humor of the original Bond films returns without all the corniness that Brosnan brought to the role in the previous films. Loving Daniel Craig? I recommend watching Layer Cake.",positive

There is no crazed villain trying to take over the world with his super advanced weapon of destruction, just an overconfident banker to terrorists, who gets a sloppy with business. Daniel Craig is definitely my favorite Bond. He brought a brutal, ""get things done however you can"" attitude to the screen that had been lacking in previous installments. And he drove a sweet car that was just that...a cool ride with just a few cool spy gadgets; as opposed to some ridiculous invisible car with endless weapons and features.",positive

"THE best bond. I don't know about you people, but all of the others seem, well, silly in comparison to this. Daniel Craig's darker, in-a-shitter-mood Bond makes a refreshing change from Pierce Brosnan's wisecracker, Sean Connery's cocky womaniser, and George Lazenby's idiot. Say goodbye to invisible cars, laser watches and jetpacks, and hello to torture, actual normal cars and good old fashioned biffos.",positive
Olin aika skeptine ku menin kattoon tätä. Yllätti tosi positiivisesti. Viel ku toi Daniel sais pikkasen lisää kovuutta touhuu ja naamaa jäykemmäks ni ois connerylle ehkä oikee haastaja.,positive
Craig's a very nice Bond!,positive
Not the true bond now is he :-),positive
Im of the opinion that Daniel Craig did a bloody good job. I think he took us alot more back to Bond than the campness of Roger Moore ever came near. He doesnt have the appeal of Brosnan or the class of connery but he brings to the table something a bit different. He gave Bond a soul.,positive
possibly the best bond movie ever i cant wait for the next one i just hope they dont bring the gadgets back.,positive
First James Bond movie i've EVER seen! Definately impressed!,positive
The best James Bond movie ever.,positive
Daniel Craig can only get better as Bond and in this film he's almost as good as Connery,positive
he's the best james bond so far I find him more realistic! sorry to the pierce brosnan and sean connery fans!,positive
I enjoy a good game of cards. James Bind gave a little more action to top it off.,negative
"I didn't really know about Daniel Craig before this movie, but, dude's a pimp. Good Bond movie.",positive
One of the best Bond movies. Loved it! Can't wait for the next three.,positive
craig=best bond ever. can't wait for bond 22,positive
Best remake ever to hit the MI6 agency.,positive
"One of the best James Bond movies ever. Brutal and dark, it still holds the same high-class thrills as your typical Bond movie but also shows the much harsher edge to his line of work.",positive
i think this an awsome movie if you have not seen it you have a hole in your life,positive
i actually liked it. it was just really long.,negative
The best Bond film in a long time,positive
incredible stunts and amazing story line,positive
Holy Balls! Probably one of the coolest Bond movies ever.,positive
"One of my favorite Bond films. I thought it was very well acted, and even though it lacked a bit in action sequences, they were all very well done.",positive
I liked. And people should stop bitching about Daniel Craig hes amazing just i dont no if I like where there going with James Bond..,positive
my first James Bond movie ever.... a little disappointed with how amazing it was intended to be buut.. it was ok..,negative
"Prolly the best made movie in. I dont know how long. My fav bond, even though I was hesitant, he pulled it off perfectly, I cant wait until B22.",positive
I like the new direction of this new James Bond.,positive
I was not happy with this blond flick as I have been unhappy with them for the past 20 years. Somewhere along the line everyone lost track of who James Bond was. He was a spy not an assasin!,negative
I like how Bond is going if they keep this up!,positive
"He is so dayum sexy-Ah watch dem balls, lmao...",positive
"The best Bond movie--hands-down. Fairly close to the book (considering the modern setting), WAY more sophisticated than any other Bond movies, and just so...well-done. Craig got it--he WAS Bond.",positive
Only great bond movie in my opinion,positive
"Ahhhh ! Le renouveau du film d'action, la sÃ©rie qui se relance. Vraiment trÃ¨s bon dans le genre.",positive
"I saw this 3 times in the theaters... the action is out of control. The opening scene alone kept bringing me back. And um, Daniel Craig, holla!",positive
Daniel Craig? In toight toight shorts? Hell yes!,positive
"Not a bond fan, but loved this movie!",positive
"Powerhouse performance from Daniel Craig is one of the highlights of the Bond film that puts the series back on track, away from the sci-fi comedy camp that was weighing it down. Not quite perfect...there are times when it drags just a bit, and the final third may bore those not familiar with the novel, but otherwise a grand entertainment, one of the best Bond films ever.",positive
"Daniel Craig is just great as 007, absolutely awesome. Be honest who wanted to play poker as soon as they saw this movie?",positive
"Not usually a fan of the Bond movies, but I loved this one.",positive
This film is the best Bond film in ages.Daniel Craig is fantastic as Bond and i love that scene when he comes out of the sea in those blue trunks cor!!!! I cant wait for the next Bond movie,positive
Although I would love Pierce Brosnan to be Bond BUT Daniel Craig did a great job. The acting was superp.. Two thumbs up from me :-),positive
"I like the old bond better, but can't wait to see where it goes from here.",negative
"Casino Royale gets that gritty feel right. The opening chase sequence is one of the best in cinema history. And while many complain about the slowing pace after the first half of this movie, I was loving every minute of it. One of the best bond films ever, certainly the best in a decade.",positive
"Since this is my first full screening of a bond movie, my opinion is not fully weighted, YET I've seen enough clips to compare it to the past and I found this one lacking. I think it was the poor attempt at a twisting plot which did not leave my mouth open. Also I thought the locations lacked umpf for lack of a better word. I was expecting glitz and lavish backgrounds and instead we see him at lame hotel and a bland casino for the final showdown. It just didn't impress. Best scene though...the torture scene. Who would of thought that a bottomed out chair would have a whole new meaning?",negative
It doesn't get more bad@$$ than Craig's 007,positive
"Best bond yet, I was worried about dear Danny Boy when they cast him but you know what, good on them....MRS B I love you",positive
"If i was gay...I'd be super hard gay for Daniel Craig. I mean, this guy shoots up a fucking embassy, can play an almost perfect card game, chase a guy through a construction site, he drives an Aston Martin V12 Vanquish (which shows taste), change into a custom tailored tux 5 times, blazes his way through an airport, and says the coldest things to everyone. Not to mention beating the shit out of a machette weilding psyco (seriously, what's up with that guy?) and have the coldest ending to a movie EVER. This movie is god. ""Yes, considerably"".",positive
"This was really good, not your standard Bond movie but man was it awesome. The chase scene was incredible and I love texas hold em'.",positive
Daniel Craig brings the cool back in Bond.,positive
i don't know...i guess i'm just not a James Bond fan in general...golden eye is really the only one i've ever liked,negative
"No offense to all the other Bonds, but Craig gets it right in this movie. Instead of ridiculous gadgets, Daniel Craig introduces a rough, sneering, and yet still charming Bond. In the end, you get the Bond that would live in reality, without any invisible cars or villains in weather controlling dirigibles. Definitely one of the better films in the Bond collection.",positive
Best of the non-Connery Bons films,positive
Best Bond Ever ! Daniel Craig gives Bond the gritty edge that has been missing for so long.,positive
the way bond flicks should be,positive
The James Bond is not handsome enough to make the movie appealing to me.,negative
no bond gizmos but the real bond !,positive
best bond film to date,positive
"Daniel Craig,007 persona redefined.The best james bond ever",positive
Best Bond after sean conery,positive
Very good - Daniel Craig fills in the huge expectations of this long awaited new version of the classic film in the James Bond series.,positive
"Now that was cool. Daniel Craig is a great Bond, the action was fantastic, the romance was believable, and the whole thing actually had a brain.",positive
Can someone teach me proffesional gambling? :),negative
James er for selvfed.. hvad mer' er der at sige...,positive
Very good...I was surprised with how good a Bond Craig was. Maybe a bit too human...,positive
Refreshingly new Bond film.,positive
Yay a real Bond movie,positive
"Are the actions/ fight scenes, even possible in real life?!?! The James Bond Character lost his appeal as a smooth intellectual guy, to some random tough buff guy",negative
Loves this iteration of Bond,positive
"God, did he look good while getting tortured!",positive
if i could give it negatives i would,negative
Suprisingly awesome for a Bond movie,positive
"Normally, I'm either disinterested in or actively dislike any Bond films which don't feature Sean Connery. This is pretty excellent, though.",positive
"daniel craig pulled it off... nice to see bond at the beginning, with flaws",positive
"Awesome bond movie, no real gadgets, just pure adrenaline and compelling storyline.",positive
Daniel Craig is 007.,positive
"Thank God for Daniel Craig. After decades weighed down by the pompous self-love of Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan, Craig has revitalised Bond with the edge brought to the character by the first three Bonds. Accompanied by a decent supporting cast, finally a good script, and amazing action sequences, the only thing this film lacked over the likes of Goldfinger and From Russia with Love is a charismatic villain, where I think Mads Mikkelsen is a bit weak. Nonetheless, CR is an outstanding Bond flick that hangs up with the very best of them.",positive
"aston martin gave it one star, effects another, daniel craig's blue eyes the third star, the action the fourth",positive
A great Bond Movie: more realistic and gritty with good action and pacing,positive
"Finally a James Bond one can relate to. This guy is much more rough around the edges, what one might expect from a well-travelled spy. Shaken or stirred?....Do I look like I give a shit! Best Bond movie in a decade or more.",positive
bond is freakin awesome,positive
And I thought they couldn't replace Pierce... Daniel Craig IS James Bond. He is one bad mother.........,positive
Bond is back and for once the old marketing line of 'better than ever' is true.,positive
"huge disappointment. I hate James bond movies as a rule, but I heard so many good things about this film that left me wondering at the end if I should maybe think about getting some new friends.",negative
"Love this one, can't wait for the sequel!",positive
"Good fun, but some of the WORST examples of product placement in a movie.",negative
A welcome change to the last decade or more of 007 movies,positive
I liked the fast paced action of this Bond movie. I thought that this movie definitely lived up to the reputation of the 007 James Bond's films. Daniel Craig was a great Bond and not too bad to look at either!,positive
Le grand retour de 007 dans ce que je trouve Ãªtre le meilleur Ã©pisode de la sÃ©rie ! Ceux qui pariaient si peu sur Daniel Craig n'ont qu'Ã  bien se tenir ! Car jamais James Bond n'aura eu autant de relief que dans cet opus.,positive
Awesome... thats all there is to say,positive
"This movie was incredible, beautifully shot and provides a credible backstory for Bond. Overall an amazing reboot of the Bond series that was long overdue. I was never a fan of the campy Bond anyway...",positive
love the poker scene.. i love any movie really where the pompous asshole bad guy thinks he won but gets it thrown in his face.,positive
Daniel Craig is superb....I hope this is an indication of things to come...,positive
not bad...but i liked the old ones :),negative
I would say the best Bond ever!,positive
Best bond movie that I have ever seen.,negative
"Badass! Outside of a couple parts that are funny because of TERRIBLE soundtrack, this is great.",positive
"First Bond film I've watched in its entirety...can't wait for the next one with Craig. He makes Bond edgy and less corny, of course, up until he falls in love. My fav line happens during a coversation between Bond and Bond girl. He starts, ""You're not my type"" -""What, smart?"" -""Single"" Good to know I'm his type.",positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery. Movie was excellent.,positive
La mejor pelicula de James Bond,positive
this was the first bond movie i wasn't actually bored at some point in! it was really good!,positive
top five bond movies for me,positive
As close to greatness as Bond has ever been.,positive
Refreshing take on the somewhat worn-out 007-theme. Daniel Craig makes an excellent portrayal of Bond.,positive
"jÃ¤mfÃ¶r med den fÃ¶rsta casino royale, med peter Sellers i rollen ....",negative
"Good, but predictible",negative
saw it on the airplane.,positive
"I loved this movie, even tho it was loooong... full of action, one of those movies you have to see more than once to get everything...",positive
"Best Bond so far, he finally acts like an agent.",positive
Finally Bond being an asshole. About time!,positive
My best 007 movie ever.,positive
"I've never been a fan of James Bond movies before. Never were. But all the hype about the new Bond and how the story is back to the beginning started to make me curious. So... I watched Casino Royale. And L-O-V-E it! I'm not sure about other Bond movies, but Casino Royale was so different. Daniel Craig made a great performance as Bond. He created a new tougher Bond. It's like a darker side of James Bond. I also like the story of the movie. Less story of Bond's adventures of women, more story of Bond's adventure with... well... bombs. This one is a great adventure movie. Lovin' it!",positive
good first attenmpt new Bond,positive
one of the best Bond movies yet!!!,positive
I love James Bond...again,positive
best bond movie made to date. can't wait for the next one...,positive
Best 007 movie of the modern era! Daniel Craig is the only actor that has come close to the level of Sean Connery's portrayal of James Bond. Fantastic action sequences!,positive
give us more of this man in swimming trunks please,negative
had great moments but there'll be better ones from craig,negative
They fixed Bond. A shot in the arm which makes Blonde Bond far and away the coolest of them all.,positive
Almost as good as GoldenEye.,positive
"Acually gotten a bit tired of Bond, finally they have the guts to make it different. The best Bond movie since IHMSS.",positive
"Pierce Brosnan as Bond was like a bad episode of Remington Steele. Daniel Craig is much better, and Casino Royale is the best Bond film in at least 20 years.",positive
This movie refreshes the stale Bond franchise and gives the character greater depth than ever.,positive
"Wonderful! A James Bond movie true to the realistic, cloak-and-dagger roots of Fleming's novels, with wonderful acting and harrowing grit. This is a serious film, not a fluff movie.",positive
actually the opening credit was my favorite part of the movie,negative
Awesome! Daniel Craig makes the best Bond yet. Now if only I could get my hands on that body!!!! ooohh.,positive
it took 4 tryes to watch it till the end.the only interesting part is parkour-chase,negative
I think this is the best Bond movie I've seen.,positive
"This is NOT a Bond film. The suave and witty Bond we've come to know has been replaced by a smart-ass punk. This film does not fit into the Bond world. It's supposed to be the story of his receiving 00-status yet isn't set in the past. It makes no sense. Ian Flemming would not be pleased. Oh yeah, and there weren't even any cleverly silhouetted women in the opening credits. This is not a Bond film.",negative
by far the best james bond movie ever made.,positive
Daniel Craig makes an awesome bond!! This movie is intense. Love it!,positive
"This was good; but i left for the torture scene. overall, i liked it..intense, but worth it.",positive
Best. Bond. Ever. Nov 2008 is the next one. BRING IT ON,positive
"I love Daniel Craig, I was skeptical, but never again.",positive
"[font=Arial][size=2]The James Bond franchise is somewhat like a television series that has been on the air for too long. If a show remains on primetime for over ten years, it begins to become stale and repetitive. I suppose studio executives refuse to allow the James Bond franchise to die because Bond is such an unforgettable character and will forever stand the test of time. The latest Bond adventure is entitled, Casino Royale. And Ill admit I wasnt entirely looking forward to yet another installment to this everlasting series, especially with a new actor taking up the role of Bond. However, dew to some awesome action and well direction, this actually ended up being quite a ride. This is your typical Bond adventure in which our hero is assigned a mission that never entirely makes sense. While on his journey, Bond drives a fancy car, jumps from buildings, faces off with a villain with a face deformity, and shows off his gadgets in and outside of the bedroom. Along the way, he also manages to find time to screw extraordinarily attractive women, deliver some one liners, and sip a martini, shaken not stirred. While Casino Royale follows the same exact formula of every Bond picture ever made, it never gets old. For months moviegoers pined over the controversial casting of Daniel Craig as the new James Bond. I myself was inquisitive to this selection. Many thought Craig would be the worst James Bond since Timothy Dalton. In my opinion, Craig achieves the same level of Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan to be one of the best Bonds. I suppose you can never judge a book by its cover and you can never judge a movie by its poster. Here Daniel Craig has the perfect presence of James Bond. He captures Bonds personality just right and succeeds on every level at recreating this timeless hero. I wont go as far as saying that Craig is a better Bond than Connery. However, he certainly has the potential to become the best Bond in the last thirty-five years. There is also of course of romance between Bond and a woman, who may or may not be secretly working for the bad guys. Either way, I bet you five bucks that Bond will sex her up before the film reaches its end. Here the Bond girl is played by the increasingly attractive Eva Green, who might be even more beautiful then Jessica Alba and Keira Knightley combined. Both Daniel Craig and Eva Green have tremendous chemistry with each other. But then again, what woman hasnt had great chemistry with James Bond? The real question is whether or not Bond will ever settle down with a girl and start a family? I doubt it. I will say that Casino Royale is not a perfect film. The audience gets far too many shots of Bond at the poker table. If I wanted to watch poker, I would watch ESPN. The film is also far too long, with a running time of nearly two and a half hours. Aside from those misfortunes, Casino Royale is still a pretty fun ride. The film is wall to wall with terrific action sequences, which are not in the slightest realistic or even possible. But so what? Casino Royale is an upgrade from some of the more recent Bond films. And I am looking forward to the twenty-second installment to the series.[/size][/font]",negative
Malisima. Excepto por la primera escena de persecucion y porque sale Eva Green :),negative
This movie was epic. Daniel Craig is an uncanny Connery.,positive
best james bond film yet daniel craig is awesome,positive
The best remake I've ever seen. This dark telling puts all the other Bond movies into perspective!!,positive
"Even though this movie was supposed to be the first episode, before James Bond got 007 status, Daniel Craig almost lives up to the original standards brought on by the original 007, Sean Connery. TOP POINTS for the very well planned and filmed parkour chase in the construction yeard featuring a well-known tracuer.",positive
Best Bond since Connery,positive
Bought it the day it came out! Daniel Craig is the best Bond yet!,positive
"First time I have ever liked a Bond movie. Loved it, actually.",positive
"A spectacular action film. Still not sure about Daniel Craig as Bond, though...",positive
I love James Bond movies and it was super fun but different,positive
this movie only perpetuates my dislike for bond films due to its one dimensional plot line. the only thing worth remembering probably was the beginning credits...,negative
"Not a huge bond fan, but really enjoyed it...see trying new things can surprise you...but not enough gadgets :( lol",positive
"Bond rules, Daniel Craig does not!",positive
"cant wait till the sequel, this is proper bond",positive
the only bond movie I can tolerate.,negative
"Coolest action ever (more realistic than most Hollywood movies, especially for Bond films).",positive
"Best Bond in recent years. Or at least since Goldeneye. It feels fresher, and the characters...oh hell, who am I kidding? EVA GREEN IS SO HOT. I'm sorry. I just needed to say that. So hot. Again. For clarification. And Daniel Craig is pretty bad ass too. That always helps.",positive
"Hmph. A nice try at rescuing the Bond franchise, clearing up the fetid skid-marks left by 'Die Another Day', but in the process it seems to have lost a lot of the Bond magic. When they make a N64 game of it, I'll respect it as much as Goldeneye. Until then, it was a bit of a diet 007 film with fewer stunts and a bit more sitting around a table. Thought it was going to redeem itself with a decent car chase, but even that lasted all of about 60 seconds. What the hell was he doing driving a Ford Mondeo?! Ah well. Nice effort.",negative
"No flies on this Bond, he really has it all! And the movie was pretty good too..",positive
bond filmleri genelde hikaye anlatmaz karakter uzerine yogunlasmaz bu filmin ise anlattigi bir hikaye ve tanimladigi bir karakter var,positive
Oh yes. Bond is most definitely back and at his best.,positive
Fresh breath for the somewhat tired franchise. Craig is awesome Bond.,positive
"iconclast is the well-embraced contemporary sympton, as once someone remarks, if you cannot surpass or live up to your idol, why don't you just tear it apart and smear it off for good? that's exactly what happens to the bond franchise in the year of 2005 with the arrival of daniel craig in the bond compaign. ""casino royale"" is an excellent action movie made for the audience who don't enjoy watching bond movies, a bond product sold by being anti-bond since its leading man doesn't give a damn to his martini shaken or stirred, and he doesn't care to wear a tie in the poster, either. (in poster of ""quantum of solace"", craig even carries an enormous machine gun instead of the classy pistol in the usual bondish fad. it's like saying, i know i'm brutish, not dashing, far from refined, SO WHAT?) the success of the bond franchise relies mainly upon its correspondence with mass ideology as well as dominant force among classes. basically the bond magnitude sprouts from the narcissism of white-collar bourgeoir males, so it's been an undisputed fact that bond is the ultimate phallic icon, a fantasized standard of ideal chauvinistic lifestyle, an unabashed celebration of materialism. BUT ""casino royale"" overthrows every principle of bond formuli, and its abandon of gentility is apparently the outrageous decree of the proletarian, hypothetically it might reflect the descending of the middle class prestige since the concept of classes has become thiner and thiner, the world tends to grow upon the M diagram (the poor gets poorer, the rich gets richer), so the necessity of shaping bond into an attainable oridinary niche grows urgent since gradually the potential market of audience who appreciates classic bondishness is shrinking, so why not make more money by attracting the rest anti-bond audience into theater? (that might include women.) besides, the looming voice of feminism sorta forbids bond from any frivolous lovemaking without punishment since this bond is NOT rewarded with a ravishing beauty this time in the end. as edward norton puts it in the interview with famous critic elvis mitchell, we need to make our version of corrupted copper story, every gendre re-tailored for OUR generation, a demanded realism craved by contemporary audience. but norton's idea gets defied by mitchell, how about audience who seeks larger-than-life experiences on the silver screen, people who want to escape from their daily life by watching movies?? (somehow norton jumps to another topic unawaringly without replying.) that's precisely how i feel about the concept of cinema as well. cinema itself is an artifice of human imaginations or the magnified reflection of humanity. so the former's inclined to be CAMP; the latter's developed into DRAMA. unfortunately james bond identifies better with the former. to me, the persona of bond is a shameless cheer of camp, a joke i often giggle upon, why this man strangely demands his martini shaken or stirred, why his chicks always have bizarre names like pussy glore, why he has to utter some acid wisecrackers while he might risk his life to be killed by villains, why his enemies are always oriental communists..this man is cartoonishly fabricated with his elegant demeanors to perform his license to kill as well as a lauging stock for ridicule. don't you think it is very campy to skillfully slaughter a terrorist and still remain georgeous in your suit? as roger ebert puts it in better words: """"""Please understand: James Bond is not an action hero! He is too good for that. He is an attitude. Violence for him is an annoyance. He exists for the foreplay and the cigarette. He rarely encounters a truly evil villain. More often a comic opera buffoon with hired goons in matching jump suits."""""" and that's exactly the purpose to watch bond movies, being lavished by all the technological inventions and the juxtaposition of ruthless assassins and goofy chicks with big boobs. (pardon the expression.) it becomes pointless to me by watching a bond who is solemnly squinting, embittered with betrayals, ruggedly carrying his missions, and indignantly mistaken as parking lot boy. but don't get me wrong, ""casino royale"" is absolutely cool, daniel craig is a terrific action hero, and eve grean is definitely one of hottest chicks ever alive. BUT it puzzles me greatly to watch a bond flick with a clumsy loner hero while i could see the similiar types of action heros in other franchises like die hard, bullit, dirty harry...something i could be sure about now is JAMES BOND WILL NOT BE BACK. but have lots of people truly missed him? do you think the movie company truly care about the bond prestige? of course not, they just want to utilize the presence of an EVERYMAN to sell more omega watches as well as some absurdly expensive roadsters since men could picture themselves better with those accesories now.",positive
"One of the best best Bonds, 007 producers should've been done this when Pierce Brosnan signed on as Bond back in 1995. Daniel Craig is great Bond but he ain't no Connery,",positive
"Not bad for a secret agent movie, but this didn't feel like the James Bond of whom I've become such a fan. I am not opposed to having a new actor play Bond, but Daniel Craig was not the right choice. Too full of glib remarks the most recent Bond film was, I agree; nevertheless, such a dramatic change was unnecessary and really makes me wonder what the owners of the franchise were on when they decided to scrap the classic Bond-feel that had brought me to the theaters again and again. Daniel Craig is all brawn and no wit. I'd be surprised if he was the best they could find; more likely he was the cheapest. The casting director ought to have taken Chris Rock's advice from the Oscars: ""If you can't get a star, wait."" If you want Tom Cruise, and all you can get is Jude Law, wait. This was a good spy movie, but was it Bond? No.",negative
"Oubliez vos prÃ©jugÃ©s sur Daniel Craig, le nouvel interpÃ¨te James Bond est peut-Ãªtre blond mais il Ã©lÃ¨ve ce personnage a un niveau jamais vu ... Autant le dire tout de suite ce James Bond est le meiileur de toute la sÃ©rie. AprÃ¨s une pÃ©riode ""Pierce Brosnan"" qui a rÃ©duit les J.Bond a des films d'actions sans saveur et ridicule ...Dans Casino Royale vous aurez le droit Ã  du vrai J.B c'est-Ã -dire un film d'action intelligent et bien ficelÃ©, avec un Bond qui sa part d'ombre et de lumiÃ¨re, des cascades et des combats a en couper le souflle et une ""James Bond Girl"" (Eva Green) qui n'est pas lÃ  juste pour faire belle. Dire que mÃªme les scÃ¨nes ""calmes"" du film comme la partie de poker vous tiennent scotchÃ© Ã  votre fauteuil et ont tout leur intÃ©ret. Enfin je conseille ce film Ã  tout le monde et VIVEMENT le prochain !",positive

very disappointed with this one. where in the world did those gadgets go? looks more like a western version of Ong-Bak. Loved the chase scene in the beginning but thats about it.,negative
One of the best bond movies,positive
Daniel Craig is one of the best Bonds ever.,positive
By far the best Bond! I had to watch it a second time to really appreciate it. Quite dark in places only spoiled occasionally by some slightly cheesy scenes and an awful performance by Eva Green.,positive

"i woild say Daniel Graig has the potentail to be be one of the best bonds along side Connery and More, you almost see Craig play a bade also he that good, the only couple of gripes i have on this film is i wish the stick 60/70s feel to to the film when james bond first came out and the card game went on to long",positive
"""Made you feel it did he?"" Rare that a throwaway line in the pre-title sequence (in black and white at that) both encapsulates and revitalises such a venerable film franchise. Craig breathes life into this iconic character and takes him outside all the normal tickboxes for a Bond film. Yes there are beautiful women, yes he drives Aston Martins and yes the action sequences are more than up to par. But Craig shows a man who makes mistakes, who mourns the passing of his soul and for a moment genuine love for a woman seen as a worthy pursuit rather than a disposable pleasure. Yes the torture scene is squeamish and wince enducing (its worse in the book to which this film is surprisingly faithful) but it is part of turning James Bond into 007. Well worth watching",positive
Best James Bond movie ever! After three Austin Powers movies I think the creators had enough. A great reboot for the series. Can't wait for the next one.,positive
Was skeptical at the start but was I surprised. Excellent job Daniel. Excellent job. my hat's off to you and the director,positive

great bond comeback outside of the worst poker scenes in history.,positive

"Wow - finally rid of Pierce Brosnan who brought the James Bond character to the lowest RANK of politically correct stench I have ever seen in production. When I saw the animated ""The Incredibles"" I was humorously shocked at the Bond ""bonding"". It was so well done in just a few steps. Equally as well, erupted the ""Bourne"" series which captured the energy the Bond series producers seemed to have forgotten in sacrifice to political corretness. This latest Bond seemed to recognise the ""Bourne threat"" and restored my faith - that maybe...just maybe the Bond production team might actually realize what it has.",positive
Best James Bond movie for me,positive
"Easily the best Bond movie since Goldeneye. Daniel Craig is an excellent 007 and plays him very well as a new double-0. Starting with the amazing acrobatics of the opening scene, the movie never lets you breathe! And that's a good thing!",positive
"My favorite James Bond. About half an hour too long, but still enjoyable.",positive
I love Bond and this movie was supposed to be sooooo different. Instead it was just another bad Bond film.,negative
Daniel Craig delivers.,positive
"A dark and damaged Bond, drawing a little more on the original Ian Fleming characterisation. It jumps straight in with an unmissable free running sequence at the start with the supreme SÃ©bastien Foucan and continues the pace all the way through. Oh, and did I mention Daniel Craig? :-)",positive
"surprisingly good movie, daniel craig much better than expected....revitalized the series",positive
a classic movie with lots of action and something new i havent seen in all the bond movies...james bond actually is presented VULNERABLE...wow,positive
One of the best James Bond movies made.,positive
Best Bond I've seen in years. Daniel Craig is fantastic.,negative
I think I saw this movie two maybe even three times.,positive
"If this bond isn't THE Bond then there ain't no justice, Daniel Craig kicks ass and is a very dangerous bond, as bond should be.",positive
Skulle jag vilja se en poker film sÃ¥ hade jag kÃ¶pt Maverick med Mel Gibson....,negative
"I agree with my friend Emre Altan. The best, the most realistic, the most passionate; plus the darkest one of them all. The JB of today.",positive
Good action the firt half.,negative
"Great 007, better than Pierce.",positive
"I always thought Bond films were fun even if they were a bit campy, but this film made Bond art. Just an amazing piece of movie making.",positive
"It is not a real James Bond... but better, realistic and passionate than all of them.",positive
Far better than the last one but can do better again!,negative
It must be the best Bond I've ever seen!,positive
Best James Bond movie made in the last 4 Bonds... I love the direction they have gone with this classic series!,positive
"very good film,one to watch over and over and over and over again.",positive
another class 007 film by our gud old james bond.hes bin killin people for the last 40 years ud of fort he wud be retired by now,positive
My all time favourite Bond. He's the man!!! Fab!,negative
Certainly one of the best Bond films. A less than perfect Bond lends credence to the character.,positive
"Nolan & Bale pelastivat Batmanin, Campbell ja Craig Bondin. LÃ¤hes yhtÃ¤ viihdyttÃ¤vÃ¤ kuin Roger Mooren parhaimmat nollanollaseiskat. YllÃ¤tyin.",positive
The best bond movie in recent memory. Very enjoyable.,negative
The chase at the start was awesome... downhill from there,negative
Best bond film in years. Daniel Craig was perfect for the role which surprised me.,positive
Best Bond yet. The black and white opening scene and the chase through the construction site were awesome,positive
I wouldn't say it was the best bond but it was the best since sean connery and rodger moore,positive
Best Bond yet...oh And I worked on it..Hehe,positive
"One of the more realistic Bond movies thus different. A lot of people dislike it because of it not displaying the same James everyone grew to know throughout the years, but that's exactly what makes me like it... Daniel Craig is suprisingly great! I really grew to love this movie...",positive
"What has happened to all the James Bond cool and charm? I'm afraid Daniel Craig just doesn't cut it for me as Bond. While Casino Royale is good for the edge of your seat kind of Bond action, I'm afraid that's where it ends. His hair is always a little ruffled, even before he gets into a scrape and that's a no go! Bring back Pierce (or even Sean at this stage)!",negative
"This is he best bond. if you read the books, this is the closest actor/portrayal",positive
This one lost me right off the bat with a ridiculous ten-minute opening action sequence but recovered with a decent enough story line afterwards.,negative
"Upto date, and you can finally believe bond could kick someones arse. The rest of the are nonces- any one of them ACTUALLY look like a secret agent, let alone beat anyone up?",positive
Awesome action flick,positive
Was never a fan of the James Bond series until this movie.,positive
"Wanted to watch this for a while as people tell me its the greatest Bond ever. It's good, but no where near 'the best Bond'",negative
"Hated this film, I was sooo disappointed. In fact I can't even be bothered to write about it that's how unispired I feel about the whole thing.",negative
The footrace justified the whole movie.,negative
"Really wasn't sure about a blonde, blue eyed Bond - But he does it VERY well - glad to hear he signed on for another four films - looking forward to see whatelse has to offer. It is a typical Bond movie though - corny, full of cliches and alot of destruction! GREAT STUFF",positive
One of the best Bond films ever!,positive
Best recent bond movie,negative
"Daniel Craig makes the best 007, ever!",positive
Surprisingly good...with that classic bond flair,positive
the2007 bond very good,positive
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! And Amber and I's endless commentary throughout the movie :P,positive
OMG this was a goood movie!,positive
Better than I thought.,positive
daniel craig is to pierce brosnan as pierce brosnan is to sean connery.,negative
Not the best plot. But a better Bond than recent other Bonds,negative
I'm withholding judgment until we see his second attempt,negative
a blonde bond?! ingenious!! ;),positive
I'd like to give it another viewing.,negative
"AMAZING MOVIE!!!! I'm not a James Bond fan, but I thought this looked good. I'm so glad I saw it. Classy and freakin' awesome! They did good when they updated Bond.",positive
"One of the better 007 flicks in recent times. The storyline was better than the last 2 which starred Pierce Brosnan (my fave-what a pity). Interestingly, I felt it hard to picture how Daniel Craig's 007 evolved into a Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan 007 over 20-30 years. Drastic change!",positive
I love how it is James Bond when he first be comes a 00,positive
Being the first bond film that i have watched i was largely surprised about it all. The suspense and the overall outlook of the film gave a certain cool charm which accompanied by the script made this one hell of a film. Although one downer of the film was its large amount of product placement which for me spoilt the film as Bond is constantly flashing some sort of gadget.,positive
the worst bond movie,negative
amazing...a must-see if ur an action fan,positive
Pierce who? Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond is the best since Sean Connery. He is rugged and ruthless!,positive
A classic James Bond. Lots of gunfire and explosions and I love the casino scenes.,positive
"Love it, love it, love it.",positive
"After all of the haters had there say, Daniel Craig comes out fighting! This Bond feels fresher, tougher, and most importantly, real. Oh, and of course that lovely shot of him coming out of the water in his trunks to, phew!",positive
good but not fantastic,negative
My fave part is when he gets hit in the sac... repeatedly!,positive
"I really liked Daniel Craig as Bond. I'm not a huge Bond fan, but I really like this one.",positive
Well like everyone else I was skeptical of Daniel Craig as Bond. When I saw this movie I was like holy shit! It was awesome and instantly one of my favorite bond movies of all time... cant wait for the next one.,positive
"Very dark for Bond, not corny enough.",negative
one of the best bonds.,positive
Worst James Bond ever. He's so arrogant...,negative
The Best of all Bond's series .. impressive,positive
SAY IT!!! JUST SAY IT! ULGA WANT MORREE!,positive
"Danny craig, best bond ever!",positive
"oh, liking the darker dirtier bond. this one had true grit",positive
"Bond re-vamped. This is James Bond. Second to Sean, in my book.",positive
entertaining but with some cringeworthy dialogue,negative
To my surprise I really liked this Bond film. Daniel Craig did his own Bond.,positive
Åimdiye kadar gÃ¶rdÃ¼ÄÃ¼m en hareketli bond..,positive
Mmmm Daniel Craig - need I say more,positive
"finally the first 007 novel in film, and finally a believable films, don't know about you but i fracing hated all the gadget bullshit. Craig plays a real bond, cold + ruthless. loved the suspense, made the poker watchable. great film",positive
he's like the best bond yet,positive
Nice new bond Great actor,positive
"Different from a typical Bond, but really good! I loved Pierce as Bond, but Craig does a great job too! Hot, hot, hot!",positive
"You should not mess around with a working formula. They did and it turned out to be the best Bond since ""From Russia with Love""",positive
"Bond clÃ¡sico. Eva Green es una diosa, me encanta. El problema de craig es que no proyecta la sofisticaciÃ³n de los Bonds de Connery o Brosnan.",positive
"not much of a Bond fan at all, but I really enjoyed this one. Bond finally feels human, has emotions. This is the first 007 movie that centered more on story than the action.",positive
"Daniel Craig is a bad-ass Bond. If you don't believe me, watch it for yourself.",positive
"A lot of people were saying ""O this is like the worsest James Bond movie ever!"" But I liked it and I found it just as good as any of the other 007 movies.",positive
Bond back to his best. Eva Green oh my god!,positive
"Take out most of the savvy, smarts, and gadgets, and all you have is just another forgettable action movie. This is probably one of the lamest movies I've ever seen.",negative
I am a bond nut. Daniel Craig makes a great ruff around the edges Bond. Great movie for start the franchise over with.,positive
"Superb, Bond reinvented and reinvigorated by Daniel Craig. Violent and graphic, much more physical and on the pace of the Bourne franchise, great work. Eva Green a bad girl.",positive
Enjoyable. Daniel Craig pulls off a decent 007. I look forward to the sequels,negative
Daniel Craig has taken off well frm where Pierce Brosnan left,negative
"I'm a true 007 fan (since The spy who loved me '77) this version of CR was great! as awlways: great stunts, great action, sexy ladies, and the story line was great, it was awesome as a fan to see how JB got his 007 status!",positive
Really good start from Craig.. Good Bond.,positive
best bond since goldeneye,positive
"not a bad installment to the bond series, but needs to improve Daniel!",negative
"A very good movie... Daniel Craig was very good but Sean Connery is the best Bond ever, I think!! But Roger Moore is awesome too!!",positive
"My Favorit Bond Ever, one for the ages!",positive
only because the poker scenes is good!,negative
Back to Fleming's orginal idea for Bond. Nicely Done!,positive
"this movie was awesome! i love the stunts, i love the action scenes! right from the start i was soo impressed with the chase, the way the actors moved like lithe jaguars and how agile they were! this movie was a nice surprise since i wasn't exactly thrilled to watch it cause i didn't initially like the actor who played Bond - but after the first few scenes i began to see why he was chosen. the new bond oozes such ooomph and magnetism, and his body was just perfect. i like how he was so toned and buffed but not bulky and gladiator-like. he may not be as good-looking as his predecessors but i think he has the most raw appeal and is perfect for the role. the scenes were amazing, the part where he almost had a heart attack was something else...the chase up the crane, i could go on and on....but to sum it all up, this movie was amazing. MUST SEE!!",positive
Easily the best Bond-movie.,positive
Bond at his darkest and possibly the best portrayal yet,positive
"super actor, tare actiune!!! c sa mai zici!!! dak nu-l vezi esti 1 nimeni",positive
The angry young Bond! Craig proves that he is 101% perfect for 007.,positive
"I'm not a Bond Fan. In fact I go out of my way to avoid Bond movies, but this film totally changed all that! It's a proper film with real character development and less random gadgets (Yes yes, they're fun but when they're substituted for plot you have a problem) Daniel Craig is a great Bond, and remaking the original Bond to give the iconic character a background finally humanises him",positive
"After Die Another Day turned out to be a stinker, I thought Bond was going down the drain. Enter Daniel Craig and a series reboot and BAM, Bond is the coolest he's been in years.",positive
"so unbelievably good - can't wait to see the next flick with the same Bond..Sorry, Pierce, but it turned out you suck!",positive
My fave Bond film - and Daniel Craig is great!,positive
Best Bond movie in a loooong time.,positive
"daniel craig is probably the best bond in my opinion.. and this movie seemed far more believable then some of the over the rop bonds of past but still this movie has hot women, gadgets and more action then u can poke a stick out well worth watching",negative
So far beyond any previous Bond film that it doesn't seem fair to rate them against it. An outstanding piece of action cinema.,positive
"Spider Man, James Bond, Batman ... this depressed hero thing kind a started to bore me. But I liked the realistic fiction in this Bond Movie.",positive
I can watch it a thousand times..,positive
"its the end scene that does it for me, u just know what he's gona say.",positive
Pretty good. But I like the Bond I grew up with.,negative
I saw this in theaters and i want my money back,negative
Before I saw the movie I was sceptical wheather I would like it however after the movie I purchsed the DVD.,negative
"For trying to live up to something as big as all the past james bonds, this guy did a really good job.",negative
Fabulous! Daniel Craig makes a great addition to the list of Bonds. Definitely fits right in to the great list of Bond movies!,positive
While it is long it is good and It sure as hell beats Pierce's films. Bit more realistic too. =),positive
the best movie ever ;),positive
Daniel Craig and Eva Green are amazing !,positive
"Moody, vulnerable Bond just like the books (although no sign of the 60 a day). Great title sequence too.",positive
izlediÄim en ii bond filmi,positive
Too much love scenes. WANT....MORE...ACTION!!!,negative
Best Bond movie in many years.,positive
YllÃ¤rihyvÃ¤. Jos ei olis tienny ettÃ¤ on Bondi niin ei olis varmaan tajunnutkaan.,positive
Finally! A real fucking bond film! No fucking family friendly tongue in cheek half comedy bull crap we've seen in the past! best since TomorrowNeverDies Incredible!,positive
"The first James Bond to be brought back to the Fleming model, with great sucess. Every character was played brilliantly, it shows Bond as a vunerable human, and finally for the first time since Thunderball bleeds.",positive
"Loved it!! My favourite Bond-movie. Daniel Craig is a realistic, gritty Bond who gets his hands dirty - and he's very sexy!! The Bond-girl was the best one ever. Very good!",positive
loved the change of cinematography.. made it look like the old ones. daniel craig reminds me of the old bonds too.,negative
Bebebebebbbbb beat this,positive
"Finally a Bond, which is not having thing not so smooth",positive
Full of action and i love Bond.,positive
"A great move to get the Bond movies back on track. A much needed return to some attempt at realism after ""Die Another Day"".",negative
"Great stuff. ""I think it's hilarious that the whole world is going to know that you died scratching my balls!""",positive
Not as disappointing as many had led me to believe But there are many Bond movis that is much better than this one..,negative
"Craig, Daniel Craig. Bloody good new Bond.",positive
"Didn't think I was going to like this Bond movie but I did, it was great and Daniel Craig is a HUNK!",positive
the best james bond!,negative
"Awesome film, crappy Bond",negative
The best Bond film in years with a Bond who is completely believable and immensely watchable. This how it should be.,positive
This is the best Bond ever and I'm not that really into Bond movies...but I fuck with this one,positive
"The best Bond...well.. ever, harder, edgier and just plain better than anything else in the series. The mark of Bourne is upon you!",positive
"Not the best Bond, but better than the recent few. Back to the Bond basics.",positive
Really didn't like this.,negative
"Even though Bond as a SAS type might be contrary to the epitomy of the original character's style, the film is the best of the 007 lot more bimbos and kickass machos ...please..",positive
maybe the best bond yet!,positive
don't mess with Bond!,positive
Not your typcal bond. People has to understand that this is supposed to be the very 1st bond story to know why the show started as it is. Quite good really... thoroughly enjoy.,positive
"WICKED!!! They totally took the series in a new direction. If they had made another Brosnan style bond, I probably wouldnt have watched it once, but this was amazing, and when they make more, I will see then on the day they come out. Craig is a GREAT actor, and perfectly suited for a more gritty Bond. I love it.",positive
"The new bond is bolder, better, and just one hell of a badass!",positive
Daniel Craig brings Bond back to the suave suitor he's supposed to be. Great movie.,positive
Oih. Daniel... Agenteista parhain.,positive
Hmm not as good as Shawn but could give the rest a good challenge 2nd film will decide,positive
The best Bond movie by a mile.,positive
"Grazie per averci regalato la scena in cui lui viene torturato nudo seduto su una sedia. Grazie, grazie, grazie",negative
"Oh yeah, back to the way Bond is MEANT to be. The 5 minute parkour opening scene is SOLID gold.",negative
It's much fresh 007 movie I have seen. Some tradition line aren't same as before.,negative
Fab james Bond! Closest to the James Bond books!!!,positive
I liked Daniel Craig's vulnerability... it was pretty good,negative
not the best James Bond film ever. Daniel Craig isn't a natural Bond!,positive
"This was well worth the wait. Daniel Craig is arguably the hottest Bond yet. I was suprised by the films quick pace, focus on plot, superb action, and Craig's excellent performance. I think its my favourite of the series so far.",positive
best bond for a long time,positive
"Best bond film ever. Bit long, should of kept the film to 2 hrs, got rid of the boring bits.",positive
haha.. love the last scene,positive
this movie is really fun to watch- especially the chase scenes!!! those r freakin awesome man!! plus- i luv the theme song...,negative
Daniel Craig is smokin'.,positive
"One of the best bond films. Daniel Craig did an awsome job, he fit the part. great acting!",positive
"After a series of adequate films with Pierce, we go back to basics. However, I don't know which I prefer - the film, or Eva Green . . .",positive
"I actually hated this movie. Maybe I need to see it again, but I was not impressed in the least bit.",negative
The best Bond film I've seen.,positive
"Great Bond film, from what few movie's I've seen, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat unlike some of the older ones!",positive
"Finalmente una buena de Bond despuÃ©s de muuuucho tiempo. Ves, Brosnan, eres guapo, pero asÃ­ se actÃºa XD.",positive
A sweaty and practical Bond. For chicks.,positive
Daniel Craig forever!!!,positive
bond. james bond. aka my hero,positive
"Daniel Craig really does not look the part for me, but he still acted it very well. This movie was very enjoyable, especially after how weak Die Another Day was.",positive
"did I say they should have only done the Flemming books? Well, this one they shouldn't even have touched, assholes. Its the best of Flemming's books.",negative
"A bit too much chase scenes for my taste, but it wasn't too bad. I also thought it got a bit sappy at the end. Poor Bond...",negative
Lots of action and surprising turns,positive
"didnt like the violent scenes, best part of the movie was the poker scene and of course how he chooses and decides on his fav drink, ""shaken not stirred""",negative
"BEST BOND EVER. Considerably. Anyone who disagrees needs a refresher course. Yes, we all love Connery and he set a tough act to follow and yes OHMSS was underated and seriously deserving of a remake but we have been waiting for this film for forty years. Craig has accomplished the unimaginable and outdone the greats that came before him.",positive
An excellent film that captures the truly dark aspect of the James Bond world. A terrific restart of the franchise.,positive
"For everyone who couldn't forget that Pierce Brosnan was really just a nerd named Remington Steele, this film gives the Bond franchise a welcome shot of smuggled steroids.",negative
"Vihdoinkin Bond, joka on oikea 00-agentti, eikÃ¤ pelkkÃ¤ hyvÃ¤tuurinen naistenmies! TÃ¤ssÃ¤ leffassa juuri Bondin haavoittuvuus tekee 007:sta kovimman ja uskottavimman agentin pitkiin aikoihin! Daniel Graig on loistava valinta tÃ¤hÃ¤n viileÃ¤Ã¤n rooliin.",positive
Brialliant reboot. Craig is a great Bond,positive
"To be honest, this bond is fine..",negative
worst bond movie so far. and i've loved just about all the rest of them. opening scene almost makes it worth it though,negative
Awesome. Bond is hot as a blonde.,negative
The movie might be long but it's worth it.,positive
I need to finish this movie.,negative
"Oh my god, just how sexy is Daniel Craig. he really is James Bond with bells on.",positive
"I love James Bond films. I'll see any of them, but this one breaks the formula in every way and I love it. If you want to see the best Bond film to date, you need to see this. It's a pity Sean Connery is too old to play the part anymore. However, Daniel Craig does do an excellent job bringing the gritty realism to the film. He is an excellent Bond, only trading refinement for ruthlessness.",positive
Better than the Brosnan Era,negative
"I believe this is a great Bond film, in that it takes a more serious tone than the recent bond movies with Pierce Brosnan.",positive
"Bond movie with a twist, but still has the classic ingredients. Me likes!",negative
"Here Bond, you can have your testicles back.",positive
New Bond is the best so far,positive
Best Bond film so far.,positive
One of the Best James Bond's since Sean Connery,positive
Daniel Craig is excellent!!,positive
"Con el perdon de ""Goldfinger"", esta es la mejor pelicula sobre el agente 007 que se ha hecho hasta la fecha. Daniel Craig encarna a la perfeccion la rudeza y la sofisticacion de los libros de Ian Fleming como si las versiones de Connery, Lazenby, Moore, Dalton y Brosnan jamas hubieran existido. Esta maravillosa pelicula hizo lo mismo que ""Batman Begins"": un espectacular y muy bien pensado volver a empezar. Llamela ""James Bond Deconstructed"".",positive
"James Bond at its best! Back to basics and very realistic. And finaly for a change, new Bond is REALLY amazingly sexy! Had to watch it twice to make it absolutely sure for myself :-)))))",positive
"I loved this Bond movie. One of my favorites. I never expected to like another Bond as much as Connery and Brosnan, but Craig was great. This one had so much action to go along with a great Bond story and it explained a lot about Bond's womanizing in later stories.",positive
class 007 at his best right man for the job,positive
"Who doesn't like a Bond movie. Well I'm sure there is someone, but I like them and I thought this one was great for Daniel Craig's first",negative
"ok it doesn't look like a james bond movie, but that's why I love it!",positive
"Buena, pero a veces demasiado fantasiosa y larga....muy impresionantes los dobles en al escena de lucha en la grua..",negative
"this is the awsum,,,especially sum of the senes",positive
Very impressive - Daniel Craig has convinced me that he was the correct choice for the role!,negative
"A revitalized franchise, and the slickest Bond film in years, one of my Top 5 of 2006!",positive
Best Bond movie there is. Need i say more?,positive
"Wasn't all that bad, but was the hour long poker scene necessary?",negative
He's my Bond. Not that good-looking but he definitely strikes me as a killer and of the lady variety as well. Classic scene: he seduces a married woman and then leaves her to tail a terrorist. Talk about mission-oriented!,negative
This the best Bond movie EVER!!!. I'm sorry Sean Connery. Don't kill me. Kill Alex Trebek. He made me say it.,positive
My all-time favorite Bond movie,positive
Finally a Bond I can connect with. He is vulnerable and cool without going over the top like previous 007s. The scene with the floating house in the end was too cool.,positive
"The people behind James Bond catch up to the lucrative angle of resurrecting the franchise with a prequel in Casino Royale, Bondâs first mission as 007. In what is supposedly the first of the entire Bond series, newcomer Daniel Craig reprises the role as the youngest, blondest Bond. Donât expect early James to be as suave or refined as the others; here, he is still very much crude and arrogant, packaged as an efficient, feral killing machine. While Craig has the best Bond body yet, he is eons away from his pretty boy predecessors. His oozing masculinity could not obviously translate into the smooth alter ego that his character needs. His face is too primordial to successfully evolve, even when clad in a tailored monkey suit. His leading lady Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green) had to verbalize this in their first meeting in the train scene, the producersâ caveat in case itâs lost on the viewers. She had to say that he wears his clothes indifferently, etc. Having to tell the audience this, instead of it just being shown, revealed a possible insecurity/defense of this choice for Bond. His is a cold, savage face of a killer. Meanwhile, Green is reminiscent of a more mature Jennifer Love Hewitt; she does not do justice to her character as a quintessential object of lust/Bond girl (well she is, after all, playing an accountant). Her frame is too slight and her face too overly made up; nothing great. Only the villains were perfectly cast, even Le Chiffreâs girl was much hotter. Still, this movie showcases amazing action for the first half or so, most especially the Madagascar chase at the cockfight through the construction and embassy. You can, however, skip the pathetic Mediterranean lovey-dovey boat cruise portion with the straining Titanic-like strings at the background. What a shame, having already gotten the ever-cool Chris Cornell to supply the opening theme, with the clever intro credits.",negative
"A more mature, intelligent interpretation of Bond... but the ending was abrupt and jarring.",negative
"A taut, energetic and satisfying reboot of the stagnant Bond offerings of recent history. Even after one film, Craig has the potential of being one of the best Bonds after Connery and Brosnan (its not Pierce's fault that they didn't do the reboot sooner and gave him better scripts to work with!)",positive
Decent action scenes sandwich an hour and a half of poker. Whee !,negative
Perhaps one of the best bond films produced. Crisp picture with lavish detail. Unrelenting chemistry between Eva Green and Daniel Craig spread cunning wit and swift quips across the swath of conversation effortlessly.,positive
"JOJOJO SI ES UNA PELÃCULA MUY DIVERTIDA. NUNCA SERÃ EL MEJOR BOND, PERO SI EL MÃS ATLÃTICO Y RÃPIDO. QUIZÃS LE FALTA EL ENCANTO DE SEAN O DE PIERCE. COMO PELÃCULA, BASTANTE AMABLE.",negative
"Wow, I was really impressed considering the utter shite being put out by the Bond franchise in the nineties and so on. I loved the action, despite the fact that it was stressfully choreographed, and the story never skips a beat. My lovely dame Judi Dench really makes the film though, hah ha just kidding. Really it is worth a view, well more than just one actually.",positive
the only bond thats i liked,positive
The best Bond movie. Ever!,positive
"Best Bond yet, both the actor and the movie!",positive
"there is a very good trama but unfortunately it is very long as a film, so if you are not really IN the movie, yo fall asleep. Fortunately I was really IN the movie.",positive
BEST BOND FLICK SINCE SEAN CONNERY,positive
Maybe the best bond movie yet on the franchise. i have seen all the movies and this is in my top 2. Martin Cambell my congratulations,positive
The best Bond movie ever!!!!,positive
Loved the blood tears,negative
Stands alone as a great spy flick. Not much of a James Bond film though.,negative
"My most recent obsession - the movie, not the actor (although one cannot deny his hunkiness). Fantastic action sequences, English-English, exotic settings, amazing cinematography and beautiful throw-back music score.",positive
Enjoyable with out being spectacular.,negative
Got to love the new Bond!,positive
"Welcome back, James.",positive
"Best Bond ever? Yup, it is.",positive
"Lets not lie, Casino Royale is a brilliant Bond film and certainly the best sine Goldeneye. Daniel Craig is sensational as Bond combining the assassin role of the character with the style. O.K he might not be the refined, suave character that Sean Connery brought to the role but letâs not forget that Casino Royale is all about the beginning of Bond and how he becomes THAT Bond. We see why he does what he does and why he never stays with the same woman, apart from Tracy but thatâs a whole other story. The thing that impressed me most about Craig's Bond is the brutality of the character. Bondâs first kill in the toilet is amazing as we see Bond doing what he does best, eliminating the enemy, but at the same time the audience sees how he is affected by taking a life. Its a fantastic scene and shows two sides of Bond the films generally donât show, the killer and the compassionate being. The supporting cast in Casino Royale is also very impressive. Le Chiffre is without doubt the most realistically scary bad guy since Sanchez in Licence to Kill. Thanks to Mads Mikkelsen, Le Chiffre is seen as a baddy with everything to lose, something quite unusual in a Bond film. The fact that he has employers is an interesting concept and one which makes Bond 22 a must see, if just to see who Le Chiffre was working for. Eva Green as Vesper Lynd was a very good choice as Bonds first love. The way she played Vesper is different to the character in the books. Vesper in the books is a quiet woman who seems a bit mousy. This Vesper is sarcastic, independent and is Bonds equal in certain things. Obviously women arenât seen the same way as 50 years ago and as a result, I think the relationship between the two is more interesting. My favourite supporting character is without doubt M. Casino Royale , apart from Goldeneye, is the first time we see Judy Dench be what Bernard Lee was to Sean Connery. M doesnât always approve of Bonds methods, but she has a high level of respect for him. We see M getting annoyed after talking to the government, her nurturing of Bond after he loses Vesper and even her house. But not her name. Maybe one day. Casino Royale for me has few weaknesses and the ones that exist are very little. Why does he say cell phone when he is British? Why does Bond suddenly fall for vesper and vice versa and also, why is the Bond theme hardly used?. All very small and none of them have any real affect on the film. Apart from them, the film is a brilliant Bond regardless of it having no Moneypenny, Q, or even (gasp) dancing ladies. Watch this film.",positive
"James Bond how he should be. He's not sleazy at all, just very suave and calculated. My only complaint is the never-ending footage establishing James and Vespa falling in love - it probably only went for five minutes, but it felt like five hours!",positive
"great movie, def. watch this one.",positive
one part was like...oww!,positive
Post Bourne Bond has learnt lessons well. The best Bond by far.,positive
Der schlechteste James Bond... Scheiß Schauspieler... Passt überhaupt nicht in die Rolle...,negative
truly the best bond. by far.,positive
"I love Shaun Connery, but this guy!!! Absolutely made an outstanding choice, what a decision to bring him in as Bond. One of the best Bond films to date.",positive
Better than the David Niven version. A new Bond for a new age. Oh and Eva Green...,negative
"The agent with the one dimentional face... Yet, nice action movie",positive
an athletic james bond. chase scenes are as awesome as daniel craigs abs... mmm... daniel craig,positive
"Finally, an ugly Bond, and one who can actually act!!!",positive
Daniel Craig finally managed to chuck the majority of the gadgets away and runs into the action.,positive
I've seen a lot of bond movies and this one wasn't up to par.,negative
BEST BOND EVER (except moon raker),positive
who wants a blonde bond?,negative
Can Bond be ANY hotter?,positive
"Daniel Craig is the best Bond, besides Sean Connery of course. It was cool to actually get to see the poker scenes. Just what the franchise needs.",positive
Awesome - possibly the best Bond ever?,positive
still not bourne though,negative
The Perfect Bond of recent times.,negative
This is how Bond films should be made. casting daniel craig as bond was inspirational,positive
Best 007 movie in a long time! I think Daniel Craig makes a great Bond. Love the parkour bit at the beginning.,positive
The best Bond in a long time!,positive
"Fleshing out a one dimensional character is usually a good idea... but in the case of bond, it ruins the mystique of the character in its original form.",negative
"i love this movie. I usually like about 1 out of every 4 james bond movies, but i like the new guy so i imagine that average improves.",positive
Best Bond since 'for eyes only',negative
excellent new sexy bond,positive
this is the best james bond film every made,positive
Suprisingly good Bond movie.,positive
the best james bond ever (after sean connery of course),positive
One of the best Bond's ever.,positive
"I watched this a week ago and have already forgotten nearly all of it. I enjoyed it, it was a better Bond than the last couple of attempts but never as good as the Sean Connery Bonds (of course).",negative
Dissapointed. Only the action scenes were good.,negative
Too long! Nice to see a bond film without all those stupid gadgets! Thank good brosnan's gone!,positive
Good bond film. Avoids the silly tank chases and over the top set piece action sequences.,negative
Daniel Craig is the only reason I give it 4 stars.,positive
"This one is the best made, dont care for the other 007, well made.",positive
"The most fascinating of the bond films, if too long by about twenty minutes. Exquisite work in every department--the script, the acting, and especially the action sequences. Note: Do not watch after having surgery on your junk.",negative

I like this Bond he is cool :),positive
Daneil Craig but there will never be any one better than Sean Connery,positive
One of the best of the Bond series,positive
"I'm embarassed to say it, but this is the first and only James Bond movie I've ever seen. If it's any indication, I'm sure I'd like the other, because this is a pretty good movie. Entertaining and eventful. A good time.",positive
"They're milking Bond... he's not light haired and ""that last hand almost killed me"" ISN'T FUNNY!",negative
i had to change my panties 3 times during this movie. mmmmmm daniel craig is the best bond in a long time. soooo good!,positive
The best bond yet!!! great action and CGI,positive
Great story for Bond. Craig did a great job showing how dangerous the job may be.,negative
"With a new bond, a new type of bond begins. This bond flick is enjoyable to watch, but a little too unfamiliar. Sure, there is no gadgets, but the film also misses the classic bond charm. The film is a hit and miss in the action sequences as well, with some being enjoyable and other being...weird.",negative
Best Bond film since License to Kill.,positive
Entertaining enough but I had a lot of problems with it. One twist too many made the film longer than it needed to be. All that product placement annoyed me as well. Eva Green didn't really work for me and I refuse to believe James Bond would let himself get played by a woman like that. Best part of the film was the awesome display of 'Parkour' at the start of the film www.le-parkour.com/,negative
Great reinvisioning of Bond. Craig is up there with Connery and Brosnan.,positive
"I have seen James Bond films before, but none have been as good as this one.",positive
A wonderful way to re-invent the character. This is Bond without the crap that they were obligated to put into each film but which each of us secretly hated...I am VERY much looking forward to seeing the next Craig depiction.,positive
after i got out of the theater i was jumping over babies in strollers and sliding across cars,negative
I was really against when they first choosed Craig as the new 077. But he turned out be to an excellent 007.,negative
"James Bond, hot women, fast cars and poker all in the same movie? Are you serious!?",positive
What a change than the usual bond films,positive
"I LOVED this movie! It is really cool. I hate James Bond movies, but I absolutely loved this one! This is a freakin' classic.",positive
5 stars just for Daniel.,positive
"NÃ¤r man ser casino royale kÃ¤nns det inte som om man tittar pÃ¥ en bond film, bara en medioker action film med en pajig pokerscen",negative
"I've always loved James Bond (who doesn't?). Parcticularly enjoyed the somewhat more believab le version played by the uber-hot Mr. Craig. That chair scene...somebody turn on a fan, I'm getting hot just thinking about it!",negative
the most sexy bond .. hehe xx,positive
Money is not everything in our lives.,positive
This James Bond is a dangerous bad ass. About Time !!!,positive
"A new turn for a tired franchise, this is an impressive remake, taking Bond down to gritty, brutal roots. Feels more like a Bourne movie than Bond and boy, is this a step in the right direction!",positive
James Bond as awesome as always.,positive
Ãntligen en Bond med karaktÃ¤r och trovÃ¤rdighet!,positive
the free running was sick!,negative
"I've never been a huge fan of Bond films, I enjoyed Goldeneye but I'm too young for many before that. I thought this was brilliant, I like the idea of going back into Bond's past and think Daniel Craig plays a really good Bond.",positive
james bond looks better as a brunette,negative
"While the story line can be a little murky at times, with you sometimes finding yourself saying ""how did he know that?"" this still is an amazing action movie that moves fast and shows that our new bond is fully up to the task.",positive
Best of Bond? - it's certainly up there... love the parkour stunts at the start...,positive
The best Bond in a bloody long time,positive
"A further idea on Dalton's Bond, and Dr No. Cold, cool, and charismatic. Very good. Retains enough of it's Brosnan esq quirks to imply the following films will return to the invisible cars. Shame really.",positive
"Perhaps the greatest Bond Film to date, excellent story, acting, directing and production values. Excessive product placement though (Ford and Sony)",positive
"ITS BOND!!!! And it goes back to the basics, how can you ever go wrong",positive
Best stuff after Connery!,positive
The best Bond film yet,positive
"Definatly happy with our newest man to play Bond! This one was a great Bond, wish there was a bit more that tied into the ""later Bonds"" (given how this one was the start of Bond's career as a double-o) but for the plot it was great! definatly would appeal to non-Bond followers as well",positive
Not any James Bond story. This is a real film. Daniel Graig is convicing as Bond. James Bond.,positive
Good film - missed the 007 theme tune though,positive
A great movie to bring bond back and clear out the cobwebs. Craig is a great Bond,positive
This is a magnificent Bond!! When the franchise realised that the 'Bourne' films were beating them at their own game this was the result!! Daniel Craig shut up all of his critics!! They also did a bit of 'Batman Begins' by refreshing a franchise by going back to where it all started! Just brilliant!!,positive
more realistic than others as bond actually gets beaten up a bit.,positive
agrÃ©ablement surpris,positive
best bond film by miles,positive
"Didnt think that I would like this one, and was pleasantly surprised. Craig is a great Bond.",positive
this movie is awesome,positive
bah j ai pas aimé pis cette histoire de flush royale enervant non?,negative
"Flippin' awesome. Brilliantly re-vitalised Bondage. No laser beams and nukes, just chase scenes on foot, ball-whipping terrorist financiers and double-crossing snooty women. Much more believable, best Bond yet.",positive
certainly a boring movie!,negative
ooooohhhh. One sizzling 007.,negative
Bond at his very best - Daniel Craig is an inspired choice. All the entertainment you'd expect from Bond but with a seriously gritty edge. LOVED it!,positive
"This is the movie that turned the Bond films from the jokey, fun sit-back-and-enjoy films they had become into something altogether different.",positive
Parempi ku ne vanhat Bondit.,positive
"The best Bond film yet. The action is believable (especially with Craig as the only physically intimidating Bond to date) and the plot, based on Fleming's first and best novel, is tight and well paced.",negative
I enjoyed this movie. Unlike other bond movies but probably more realistic. Less gadgets but action-packed till the end. The chase at the start had to be the best I've ever seen. Definitely one for the movie collection,positive
A different Bond that recent interpretations. A much grittier and gutsy interpretation that fits with the chronology of the character. Nicely done.,negative
"Watched this film last night, smashing stuff. Perhaps my new favourite Bond film, it goes a long way to revitalise a stagnant franchise.",positive
It was an okay movie but it was in no way a James Bond movie. It could have been any random spy movie just as easly.,negative
I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would.,positive
First Bond movie I liked.,positive
Inever like too much bond but this movie has bought me into the fold of bond,positive
"It was time to reinvent Bond. The Pierce Brosnan era was horrible (except for Goldeneye, actually my favorite Bond film)",positive
An awesome new Bond I must say,positive
The best Bond movie since Connery. Totally modern yet still thoroughly Bond. I love you Mads!,positive
Daniel Craig ..the best Bond..,positive
"Good Movie, Lots of Action",positive
The best bond yet in my opinion.,positive
Made me remember why I don't bother with Bond... Doesn't even begin to touch Bourne...,negative
"Well done Daniel Craig, big shoes to fill and you overflowed them. Bond's back, alot better and edgier.",negative
very intense show... not d same as d normal 007 movies...,positive
"[b]Without a doubt, Daniel Craig is the hottest actor currently in Hollywood.[/b] [b]At 5'11"", this dude is the finest wxample of perfect symmetry, along with the classic, rugged, handome, sexy face, to say nothing about his ""perfectly formed ass"" (quote from film). [/b] [b]Daniel Craig is today's hotter version of Sean Connery. [/b] [b]The scene where he is coming out of the water, with his blue speedo's on, is probably the hottest male erotic scene ever filmed...the classic, perfectly formed torso![/b] [b]I give this film five 5 stars: *****[/b] [b]A must for any Bond fan, and especially any Daniel Craig fan, and for every gay man, straight woman and even straight dudes, who find him appealing![/b] [b]Daniel Craig is a physical paragon of beauty and perfection![/b]",positive
First good Bond movie in forever.,positive
"the best bond. the only downside is that he doesnt use his sexy aston martin enough. shame, i love that car!",positive
"My favourite modern Bond movie, more reserved and less over the top than the Brosnan films. And the kicker, Daniel Craig, swoon.",negative
"good action, charming thriller..... gr8 entertainer.... who gives a damn if the plot is a little frivolous....",negative
"Den beste bond-filmen,tror jeg.",negative
"I WENT INTO THIS FILM WITH A NEGATIVE ATITUDE.FOR MANY REASONS!HE DOESNT DRING A MARTENI,HE DRINKS BEER!HE DOESNT DRIVE A STANDARD,HE DRIVES AN AUTOMATIC!HE DIDNT AT FIST LOOK LIKE A BOND,BUT THATS WHAT MOST PPL SAY WHEN A NEW BOND IS INTRODUCED!!HE DOESNT SEEM LIKE MUCH OF A GOOD GUY.BUT I LOVE THIS FILM .IT W3AS SO DIFFERENTIN A GOOD WAY.IT TOOK BOND TO A HOLE NEW LEVEL(JUST LIKE WHEN TOMORROW NEVER DIES CAME OUT,NEW TECHNOLOGY ETC..)ITS UNPRODICTABLE FIM,AND A LOVE IT!!",positive
"Brillaint film. Its all there, Action, suspense, Love, and Daniel Craig brings a new spin on the role.",positive
Greatest Bond in years.,positive
"great, up until the torture scene, then quickly downhill",negative
"One of the better Bond movies, I think. Definitely the best of the later ones, even though I don't really think that Craig fits my picture of mr Bond (Connery will always be the one!). The action scenes are cool, and the story even a bit touching at the end - not exactly common for a Bond movie - even though I think a bit more explanation of how Bond ended up who he is would be in order ... not to mention a bit more explanation of those stock market dealings, which surely not all of us understand.",positive
Bond... what else is there to say!,positive
One of the best bond's yet,positive
Excellent film! Daniel Craig nous impressionne dans son 1er rÃ´le comme agent double 0,positive
Probably the best movie that I've ever seen. The best in the series.,positive
i think one of the best bond movie ever! Daniel Craig definitely put his stamp on the bond series on this film! A very true cold hearted killer,positive
Best bond movie made. Bond is finally human.,positive
he's a good james bond,positive
i like this film because daniel craig has a nice body (but face is ugly),positive
Perhaps the finest Bond film since the Golden Age of Connery. Daniel Craig is perfect. Shame about the theme song though!,positive
"Favorite Bond movie, especially since I'm not even a 'Bond' person. Loved the Bond girl, Eva Green is gorgeous!",negative
En gÃ©nÃ©ral je vais pas voir les james bond. Mais celui-la est diffÃ©rent + rÃ©aliste.J'adore la musique du gÃ©nerique,positive
Defenetly the best Bond ever!,positive
Almost not a bond its so good - great dialog.,positive
"Best Bond film I've seen, and i have seen quite a few, thank you spike tv",positive
It's true what they say. Casino Royale is the best Bond since the 60's.,positive
"Perhaps one of the best 007 films. Going back to a more real, less gadgety Bond turned out to be the way to go. Daniel Craig is amazing.",positive
Bond Is Definately back,positive
The Best Bond movie ever!,positive
Danny Craig is my favorite Bond no doubt dis dude kicks ass,positive
Best Bond EVER. Craig actually portrays the cold blooded killer Bond is.,positive
"I listened impassively to all the movie buffs and Bond 'die hards' pile shit on Daniel Craig from the announcement of his role, up to release day. I had no opinion as I hadn't seen the movie - it wasn't out yet! I have an opinion now. He is the best James Bond ever. Raw, gritty, human, and determined, he reclaims the role and personifies a more realistic super agent than the debonaire, comedic toffs that attempted it previously. This movie can't be seen just once. It is a full-on adrenaline spinner from frame 1 to finish, and draws on all the emotions. As a long term Bond fan, I say that the franchise has screwed around for 40 years having fun and making semi serious attempts at spy movies. Now they have found the real Bond. This leaves the others for dead.",positive
"James Bond is back. If you hated Pierce Brosnan, like I did, you really need to see this movie. Just end to end kickin ass, with no more of the ""space agey"" equipment in the old Bond movies. A lot of good hand to hand action.",positive
The best Bond film since Goldeneye and better than any before that. Daniel Graig is going to make a fantastic Bond.,positive
Good introduction to an interesting new James Bond.,negative
Well Daniel Craig really pulled this off...he IS James Bond and its a really action packed adventure and you get to see how Bond became the way he is.,positive
pleasure to see a new bond rather than a confused version.,positive
"My first ever Bond-movie and it wasn't bad at all. Daniel Graig was cool, Ms Green was gorgeous and the action was exciting.",positive
"The best Bond movie in a long, long time.",positive
"Good film, everything you'd expect in a 007 film - just a bit long; I thougjht it had finished...when in fact they found another turn in the story and it went on even more.",negative
"bang,,, bang!! hate Brosnan, but love Craig!",negative
Makes you like Bond again,positive
"By far the best Bond movie, and the best Bond since Connery! Craig's gritty, unforgiving 007 is for once seen as a normal human being subceptible to pain. Great storyline and action too.",positive
sorry but youre no bond blondie... bring back brosnen,negative
"The newest Bond flick really blew my expectations away as compared to the ones with the last Bond, Bronsan. Lots of adventure...Action kept me intrigued. Daniel Craig has a presence about him. He carries on the new Bond title well!",positive
Do you want that shaken or stirred? - i really don't give a damn,positive
You gotta love a bit of Texas hold 'em,positive
"Alright for ""the new bond"". He was awesome, the movie wasn't.",negative
Daniel Craig does a great job. The end was quite the surprise.,negative
Great new direction for Bond.,positive
Not like a regular Bond movie. Better...,positive
One of my favorite James Bond movies,positive
"liking the new Bond, gritty and hard, like Connery was. All good.",positive
One of my all time favorite action films. Daniel Craig earns the title of Best Bond. There's no denying that he is taking the franchise in the right direction with a completely believeable performance with true dramatic depth. Excellent.,positive
First Bond movie I've ever watched. As good as advertised.,negative
"pretty good, the opening action scene was nuts",positive
And I thought Daniel Craig wouldn't be able to pull it off...I was wrong... Though Sean Connery is still god...,positive
"Initial action sequence was great. Dialog was corny, even for a bond",negative
"great. for a blond guy whos afraid of guns, its a great movie. daniel craig is almost as good as sean connery.",positive
Quite possibly the best Bond movie,positive
Much better Mr. Bond. Let's hope it wasn't a one off.,positive
"Ok, it took some 45 years for Bond to get there, but finally the character Ian Fleming created has reached the big screen. For me, this was by miles the best Bond film ever, loyal to the original story, yet realistic and modern in it's, shall we say, re-Bourne style. I'm really looking forward to Bond 22.",positive
"I thought this was SO good, but I'd really like to see the original",positive
Bond back on form. I am suprised since Daniel Craig is about as good at acting as someone from Prisoner Cell Block H!,positive
AMAZING! It really breathed life into an almost dying franchise.,positive
"<i>""The name's Bond... James Bond.""</i><br/><br/><b>Director:</b> Martin Campbell <b>Starring:</b> Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Judi Dench <b>Running time:</b> 144 minutes <b>Country:</b> UK, USA, Germany, Czech Republic<br/><br/> I knew I was going to really like <i>Casino Royale</i> but I had no idea I was going to love it that much. To me, <i>Casino Royale</i> is the best Bond film of all time and I have many reasons for this. It is the most intense one with the best action, it has the best storyline, it has a deeply effective twist which is very rare of a Bond film and also it has that feeling to it that makes us feel that Bond is back after the <i>Die Another Day</i> disappointment but all that dashed all over again when Quantum Of Solace was released. <i>Casino Royale</i> is a very cool James Bond that I loved from start to finish. The best scene is definitely the poker game scene because it was so tense and despite that neither man could touch each other you were really keen to know who was going to be the victorious one between the two. This is also the most violent Bond so far as well. Some Bond films have complex storylines and this is one of them. I understood how the film was structured and who the characters really are. <i>Casino Royale</i> might seem a remake to the previous <i>James Bond</i> 1967 film <i>Casino Royale</i> for two reasons. One: because the 1967 adaptation isn't an official James Bond film. Two: the stories are different.<br/><br/> <br/>I really underestimated Daniel Craig as James Bond as probably everybody did before I saw <i>Casino Royale</i> but when I did see it, I wasn't disappointed at all and it turned out to be a performance that is just memorable. He was my favourite Bond until I saw the sequel <i>Quantum Of Solace</i>. Daniel Craig is what some people like to call him James 'Blond' because he is the first and only blonde haired man to portray James Bond. What I loved about James Bond in <i>Casino Royale</i> was that not only did we see the usual typical deadly and cold side to his heroic character but we also saw the vulnerable and sensitive side of things within Bond's personality especially when it comes to women. I do not understand why some people don't like Daniel Craig in this one. He was bloody amazing!! His James Bond is a new Bond regarding looks but personality is exactly the same. Despite of how good Daniel Craig is as James Bond, I do still think the James Bond role should have gone to Clive Owen instead. I think it would have been him if not Craig. Daniel Craig was a good actor before Casino Royale but wasn't as popular before as he is now. None of the 6 actors who have portrayed James Bond have made Bond his own character because they have all given different kinds of Bonds in different varieties of ways. There is one thing that all 6 actors have in common playing James Bond and that is that they all are really charming with women no matter what they look like and also they are really deadly when it comes to action scenes to rescue someone, blow something up, kill anyone etc. I underestimated Eva Green as well as Vesper Lynd. She did actually surprise me with her performance. She is in my opinion one of the ultimate Bond girls. Best Bond girl for me is Elektra King in <i>The World Is Not Enough</i> even though she is actually a villain. Green's role in <i>Casino Royale</i> was almost like a breakthrough performance for her. She did appear in Ridley Scott's Kingdom Of Heaven previously but that wasn't exactly a major role for her. She isn't a bloody amazing actress but she was amazing enough to portray Vesper and I think she is the only actress who would have been good enough or young enough to do so. Vesper is a young woman who is sent by the Treasury to help James Bond beat Le Chiffre in the poker game at <i>Casino Royale</i>. As she gradually gets to know Bond and gets closer to him, they fall in love. That is unlike Bond to do so but it does happen and it does have severe and dramatic consequences in which you would have to see for yourself. Judi Dench pleases me as always as M. M was portrayed by a man when Roger Moore, Sean Connery and George Lazenby were James Bond. I think that Dench is the only person who can portray M. M is strict, rude, determined and can be very serious in a lot of ways but always in her own way. I liked Dench's on-screen partnership with Daniel Craig more than Pierce Brosnan because I could see the frustration and the slight hate in both Craig and Dench's eyes when they are in scenes together. Mads Mikkelsen was good as Le Chiffre. He was a very scary character to watch and I can imagine that the actual actor might be a rather strange actor to meet as well. There was one light flaw about his performance and that was the complete seriousness and determination to win the poker game against Bond. I couldn't really see how serious he was being. It slightly made it feel like he is playing a poker game with fake money and with cheap poker chips but the tension between him and Bond added the spice to his character in another way.<br/><br/> <br/>Martin Campbell returns as director of Casino Royale like he did of previous Bond film and first Pierce Brosnan Bond film <i>GoldenEye</i>. Campbell has made Craig's <i>Casino Royale</i> like Brosnan's <i>GoldenEye</i>. Martin Campbell has made <i>Casino Royale</i> the most intense and most action packed Bond film so far. The story is really interesting. Yes, it is rather complex at times but you can't help but get totally gripped by it. What I was gripped with the most about the storyline of this film was like the way the world is today especially when it comes to terrorism. Like in the poker game, if Bond doesn't win the poker game, Le Chiffre will be paying more criminals to perform more terrorist attacks.<br/><br/> <br/>This film is <b>a lot</b> better than its sequel <i>Quantum Of Solace</i> which was the biggest disappointment of 2008. I just refer <i>Casino Royale</i> on its own now without <i>Quantum Of Solace</i> involved at all. Casino Royale always has been since it was released Daniel Craig's best acting performance and now it might always be in my case. Eva Green's performance as Vesper Lynd is one of the biggest breakthrough performances of all time without a doubt. Casino Royale is the best James Bond film ever! It is the <i>Goldfinger</i> of this generation and of this century (hopefully). <i>Casino Royale</i> is the action film of 2006 and one of the best of that genre let alone one of the best of 2006. I am now going to pretend like <i>Quantum Of Solace</i> never existed. <i>Casino Royale</i> is to me one of the rare action thriller films that has a long duration and has a lot of deep feelings to it as well as a twist which unfortunately leads to the sequel and in a bad way.",positive
"Best Bond ever, and they are good. Daniel Craigh is brilliant, just brilliant!",positive

"brutal, rÃ©aliste mais pas trop... Bond fait ce qu'il a Ã  faire...",positive
"The best bond movie ever made. This movie completely abandoned bond's previous ""gentleman, suave, dashing"" personality and instead portrayed him as a rough, gritty, impulsive man who is still in the process of becoming a well-rounded ""00"". Daniel Craig was absolutely great! He has what it takes to become Bond and he'll definitely be an asset to the entire franchise. Some great action sequences,a great story, and some fine direction from Martin Campbell make this the best bond experience yet.",positive

"Bond Ã¤r en av de mest seglivade filmserierna som finns. Det Ã¶verraskande Ã¤r att den fÃ¥tt hÃ¥lla pÃ¥ sÃ¥ lÃ¤nge med tanke pÃ¥ den fÃ¶rÃ¥ldrade kvinnosynen, den fÃ¶rÃ¤ndrade vÃ¤rldsbilden och de larviga prylarna som serien krystat fram. FÃ¶rra filmens osynliga bil var droppen. Casino Royale Ã¤r ett allvarligt fÃ¶rsÃ¶k att modernisera dubbelnollan. Det bÃ¶rjar perfekt. Daniel Craig rivstartar som oslipad agent i bÃ¶rjan av karriÃ¤ren. Bond Ã¤r bÃ¥de elak och gÃ¶r misstag. Han har blivit en mÃ¤nniska. Det Ã¤r helt rÃ¤tt vÃ¤g att gÃ¥. Actionscenerna imponerar frÃ¥n bÃ¶rjan med en kamp mot Parkour-akrobaten Sebastien Foucan som flyger bland lyftkranar och byggnadsstÃ¤llningar. Bond fÃ¥r svettas utan ett enda hoppfÃ¤llbart flygplan i sikte. Sen blir det pokerturnering. Med dagens pokerhysteri kan det tyckas helt rÃ¤tt. TyvÃ¤rr tappar filmen fart och lyckas aldrig riktigt komma tillbaka. Bondfilmerna ska ocksÃ¥ ha en final dÃ¤r storskurken hotar hela vÃ¤rlden och bara Bond kan rÃ¤dda oss. SÃ¥ Ã¤r det inte hÃ¤r. Den tvÃ¥ och en halv timmar lÃ¥nga filmen saknar till stora delar det driv som ett saftigt hot mot mÃ¤nskligheten stÃ¥r fÃ¶r. En sÃ¥dan fÃ¶rÃ¤ndring tjÃ¤nar inte serien pÃ¥. Men Casino Royale Ã¤r precis som Batman Begins en bra bÃ¶rjan pÃ¥ nÃ¥got nytt. Den sjunde november 2008 fÃ¥r vi veta om det hÃ¥ller i sig. Fredrik Elfving",negative
Daniel Craig is a fantastic Bond and SO hot. Much more down and dirty and tortured. Liked the back to basics approach.,positive
EXCELLENT! Who wants his car? I do!,positive
pretty good but no gadgets,negative
"Awesome, it was just an awesome movie.",positive
The most accurate Bond and probably the last.,positive
Bond makes a pretty good killing machine. Too bad the girl shows up and the movie goes to shit. Fast.,negative
tråkig orkade inte ens se klart den,negative
Great redirection for the bond series,positive
the taint of paul haggis stains this film,negative
"I was so prepared to dislike this film, imagine my suprise when I came away loving it! The new Bond is a breath of fresh air. The only detraction - so ugly *shudder*",positive
"I hate what they have done with the Bond franchise, they should have killed off the series when they ran out of Ian Flemings work to base the movies on. Franchise dead to me now..the best Bond will always be Connery!",negative
LOVED IT!! Daniel Craig puts a fantastic spin on the role! (and is so HOT in and out of his suits!),positive
I'm excited they got Daniel Craig to play the new Bond. He is pitch perfect for the role.,positive
"Hands-down the best Bond film of all time; in fact, after seeing this one I'm willing to forget about all the others and start with this as the first movie. Where do I begin? Daniel Craig is THE best James Bond yet; fierce, intense, and not afraid to bash heads (or tear through a solid wall) at a moment's notice. The action is abrupt, intense, but within the realm of possibility, and losing Q, Moneypenny, and the outlandish gadgets has helped considerably. In addition, the opening few minutes and introductory song are nothing short of exhilerating (Chris Cornell puts Madonna to shame!) And finally, having a story with genuine emotion and danger makes all the difference (who knew?)",positive
"the only 007 i've ever liked, and the most entertaining movie of 2006.",positive
"Best movie I've seen in a long, long time. Daniel Craig makes an excellent Bond. Definitely kicks Pierce Brosnan's ass.",positive
hands down the best bond movie around..and he's just hot,positive
"Absolutely stunning! Daniel Craig puts all the past Bonds to shame, with the exception of Sean Connery of course! Definitley one of the best!",positive
"A very good movie, I was actually a lil skeptical about watching at first. However, once I did, I enjoyed very much. The only thing I would add, is a lil more suspense to the poker game.",positive
"Good, interesting take on James Bond. HOWEVER, suffers from silly gadgetry. Best part of the movie is when he gets hit in the nuts.",negative
Just what the James bond's series needed...and also the sexiest one,positive
thank you for bringing bond back to reality mr. craig i'm sick of invisible cars,positive
"good acting, but terribly boring story",negative
Screw Connery. Craig is the best Bond. Martin Campbell outdid even his previous Bond movie (Goldeneye) with this one.,positive
Finally a real James Bond movie.,positive
"Fantastic Bond movie, making him more hard-edged is what the Bond series needed after Die Another Day.",positive
i like the new 007 better.,positive
A new grittier Bond and no stupid gadgets.,positive
"Oh my god, Daniel Craig. The BEST BOND EVER!!So hot!!!!!",positive
Daniel Craig is in my list of top actors from now on. He made James Bond sexy again. Loved it!,positive
I didn't like this James bond- if they just dropped the title of James Bond then we could talk...,negative
"Really liked this revamp. And Craig was all a bond should be. Ballsy, Bold and a bastard!",positive
"not the typical bond movie tho... was good, without being great",negative
LOVED HOW THEY RECREATED IT IT ONLY GETS FOUR STARS BECAUSE I'M NOT A BOND FAN,positive
"stupid! waste of three hours, you want to see it i'll give you my copy",negative
"by far, the best james bond film.",positive
I love it! The opening credits were fascinating lol,positive
"Just like me, this bond manages to show that you can fight for the good guy's but still be a bad-assed mother fucker! Coolest Bond ever. lol.",positive
"craig did a much better job than i expected, new bond nov 2008!",positive
"I'm probably gonna be slightly bias about this film cos i wne to a charity premire a day before it was released. By far the best Bond film, it gave a new lease of life to an otherwise dwindeling frachise!",positive
"Tycker att denna film överskattas, utan att för den delan va dålig",negative
"Not the best Bond, but a great Bond.",positive
"Like the Bond movies, what can I say?",positive
Bring Bond back to his roots and make the best bond movie yet. That was the formula for Casino Royale and it worked completely. Daniel Craig rivals Connery with his performance as a completle badass without worrying about just being pretty. The action scenes are much more modest and well done because of that.,positive
Easily the best Bond since Connery. And a great movie to go with it. Let's hope he gets a few more...,positive
Best Bond movie since From Russia With Love.,positive
the best Bond yet...,positive
"A great Bond movie to watch. No gimmicks or pithy remarks, just straight up Bond. Makes me want to go out and play some Texas Hold'em.",positive
"Seemed like a more 'realistic' Bond movie, less about stunts and more about the characters and background. Enjoyable, if a little long.",negative
A different Bond or rather 'fit' Bond...,positive
"To begin with it's pretty much typical boring at-to-b-to-c James Bond and then about halfway through it goes completely the other way and you sit there and think 'James Bond is crazy, he's CRAZY' and then also the bollock thrashing which is pretty much the best torture scene this side of Oldboy.",positive
Two words.....Blue Trunks....Gosh!!,positive
Fantastic film and debut from Daniel Craig. The Bond franchise is in good hands!,positive
packed with action. way better than any of the other bond movies i've seen,positive
One of the best Bond films I've seen.,positive
"At last a muscular Bond who represents something of Fleming's creation. Drifting into cliche but it was refreshing to have a character, a plot and no amazing watches.",positive
"great bond film, good bond, well constructed plot and pacey.",positive
Vodka martini.... shaken or stirred...Do I look like I give a damn? class,positive
The first proper Bond movie! Easily the best script of all of them. I can't wait to see more of Daniel Craig's Bond...,positive
Possibly the greatest Bond ever,positive
This is an excellent action movie in every aspect. Loved it.,positive
One of the best Bond movies since Goldfinger.,positive
Awesome. Daniel Craig is a B.A.,positive
Daniel Craig makes an excellent James Bond and it was by far one of the better James Bond movies. Its a hell of a lot better than the recent ones.,positive
"I'm not normally into Bond films, but this Bond kept me watching.",positive
"1 des meilleurs films de 007, nous voyons ici les dÃ©but de James bond et ses points faibles!!! J'adore Ã§a....juste le fait de savoir comment il a eu son auto ou bien comment il en est devenu Ã  boire son drink habituel!!! en plus Daniel CraigÂ¸....Mmmmm!",positive
"YES! Finally.. a Bond movie without the uberlame Brosnan and his cheekiness! I'm a Bond fan, reborn!",positive
"Pierce Brosnan was ""the"" Bond in my books...until I saw Casino Royale. Daniel Craig unleashed the suave but tough guy aspects of the Bond character with unprecedented bravado! Definitely my favorite James Band flick in years!",positive
Taitaa olla paras Bond leffa,positive
Best Bond ever! One of the best action movies I've ever seen and I have a hetero-crush on Danny Craig. What?,positive
"Magnificent. Being a avid Ian Fleming fanatic since childhood, I thought this was the first Bond film that was actually true to the book. Cheers, Daniel Craig!",positive
Wow! action all the way i even loved the opening titles!,positive
Sean Connery'den sonra Ã§evrilen tÃ¼m James Bond serisinin en az abartÄ±lÄ± filmi bence. Birde beÄenilmemisine karÅÄ±n Craig David'in performansÄ±da gayet iyi. Seyredilmeli,negative
"Eh, was pretty good...But I miss Pierce.",negative
A great start for Daniel G..,negative
"before i saw this i didn't like bond films and i didn't like daniel craig, but he is HOT!",positive
"The best Bond of all, hands down. Daniel Craig brings 00 status to a whole new level.",positive
"James Bond. But this time he's back with a dose of reality. The stunts are real, the characters are developed, the action is fairly grounded, the story is present and the movie still rocks. This is James Bond - brutal and no-nonsense. Special mention to Eva Green and her amazing eyes. Warning: Some coarse language and the most painful torture males can witness.",positive
the best bond film for a while and brosnan's movies were all pretty good... craig excels at a grittier bond... you see bond hurt...a lot. visceral and punishing but equally witty and funny. watch it,positive
"I love James Bond films, Pierce does something for me, the new Bond isn't bad though!",positive
The best Bond film. Much better than the fantastic way Bond has gone since Moore,positive
The first James Bond movie I enjoyed.,positive
Daniel Craig... is the best Bond ever..!!,positive
"SiitÃ¤ on kohuttu vuosikaupalla ja sitÃ¤ on odotettu malttamattomasti. Onhan kyseessÃ¤ sentÃ¤Ã¤n valtava elokuva-alan instituutio. LiikkeellÃ¤ oli aikanaan huhuja, ettÃ¤ pÃ¤Ã¤osanesittÃ¤jÃ¤Ã¤ ei lÃ¶ydy, ohjaaja oli lÃ¶ytÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¤ ja suuren profiilin naisnÃ¤yttelijÃ¤t eivÃ¤t halunneet siinÃ¤ esiintyÃ¤. Ja kun pÃ¤Ã¤osan esittÃ¤jÃ¤ sitten lÃ¶ytyi, hÃ¤net tyrmÃ¤ttiin tÃ¤ysin sopimattomana rooliin ennen elokuvan julkaisua. Kaikki muuten seikkoja, jotka vain vetÃ¤vÃ¤t enemmÃ¤n ihmisiÃ¤ teatteriin. TiedÃ¤t jo varmasti mistÃ¤ on kysymys. Uusi Bond elokuva on pÃ¤Ã¤stetty valloilleen maailmaa valtaamaan. Agentti 007:n tarina siis jatkuu, tai oikeastaan siis alkaa, Casino Royale kertoo miten Bond saavutti aiemmissa elokuvissa nÃ¤hdyn arvostetun agentin asemansa. Ian Flemingin ensimmÃ¤iseen, vuonna 1953 ilmestyneeseen kirjaan perustuva Casino Royale seuraa James Bondin ensimmÃ¤istÃ¤ 007-tehtÃ¤vÃ¤Ã¤, joka johtaa Bondin vaarallisen Le Chiffren kannoille. Le Chiffre on maailman terroristien pankkiiri, joka menetettyÃ¤Ã¤n varansa pyrkii hankkimaan ne takaisin Casino Royalessa jÃ¤rjestettÃ¤vÃ¤ssÃ¤ pokeripelissÃ¤. Bondin on voitettava Le Chiffre pokerissa lopettaakseen tÃ¤mÃ¤n toimet ja tuhotakseen terroristiverkoston suunnitelmat. Muuten onnistuneessa elokuvassa pokeripÃ¶ydÃ¤n Ã¤Ã¤ressÃ¤ vietetyt hetket saattavat kuitenkin puuduttaa jos et nÃ¤e pokerissa mitÃ¤Ã¤n hohdokasta. Bond on ajan hermolla, pelimuotona on tietenkin Texas Holdâem. BrittinÃ¤yttelijÃ¤ Daniel Craig esitellÃ¤Ã¤n James Bondin roolissa Casino Royalessa tukenaan vahva kansainvÃ¤linen nÃ¤yttelijÃ¤kaarti. Dame Judi Dench on jÃ¤lleen M, Britannian salaisen palvelun johtaja. RanskalaisnÃ¤yttelijÃ¤tÃ¤r Eva Green on kaunis Vesper Lynd, ensimmÃ¤inen nainen, johon James Bond rakastuu. Tanskalainen elokuvatÃ¤hti Mads Mikkelsen esittÃ¤Ã¤ Le ChiffreÃ¤, kansainvÃ¤listÃ¤ rahanpesijÃ¤Ã¤ ja Bondin kilpailijaa. AmerikkalaisnÃ¤yttelijÃ¤ Jeffrey Wright on Felix Leiter, Bondin liittolainen CIA:ssa, ja tunnettu italialaisnÃ¤yttelijÃ¤ Giancarlo Giannini on puolestaan Mathis, Bondin MI6-kontakti. Elokuvassa on luonnollisesti toimintaa, hyvin nÃ¤yttÃ¤vÃ¤Ã¤ sellaista. Tosin tÃ¤llÃ¤ kertaa turhilla rÃ¤jÃ¤ytyksillÃ¤ ei mÃ¤ssÃ¤illÃ¤ vaan tilanteet ovat realistisesti nÃ¤yttÃ¤viÃ¤ ja samalla siis uskottavampia. Vaikka Bond on Ã¤ijempi kuin koskaan, roolissa on inhimillisyyttÃ¤, jota ei ennen olla nÃ¤hty. TÃ¤mÃ¤ elÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤ suurempi agentti saa ruhjeita, loukkaantuu ja on jopa hyvin lÃ¤hellÃ¤ menehtyÃ¤. Elokuvassa on pari virhettÃ¤, jotka hyppÃ¤Ã¤vÃ¤t silmille niitÃ¤ erityisemmin hakematta. Mutta eivÃ¤tpÃ¤hÃ¤n ne onneksi paljon tunnelmaa latista. TekevÃ¤llÃ¤ sattuu, se siitÃ¤. Uusi Bond on selkeÃ¤ harppaus parempaan suuntaan jo hivenen vÃ¤ljÃ¤htÃ¤neessÃ¤ elokuvasarjassa. TÃ¤ssÃ¤ agenttileffassa on munaa vaikka Bondin omat kulkuset ovat niin kovalla koetuksella, ettÃ¤ mies katsojia vihlaisee varmasti omastakin jalkovÃ¤listÃ¤. Ja Daniel Craig on loistava uusi Bond, hÃ¤n tuo hahmoon sen kaipaamaa rÃ¤vÃ¤kkyyttÃ¤ ja asennetta. HÃ¤nen Bond-uransa saa jatkoa pikapuoliin. Seuraavan Bondin kuvaaminen alkaa jo ensi kevÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤.",positive
"I particularly like the parts where Bond is running, shooting people and consuming alcohol.",positive
Much MUCH better than expected :),positive
A James Bond movie that is entertaining and good? And I thought that all Bond movies had to have contrived stories and ridiculous over-the-top action.,positive
Didn't expect to like it..loved it.,positive
"Best bond movie, no funky gadget, no distracting sex scene, no excessive 'ads', rough, cool and real",positive
One of the best bonds to come out in years. At least since the first Pierce Brosnan,positive
very gud hes deffs the best james bond by far,positive
"excellent bond, oh yes",positive
"Just like the original novel, this is the Bond I've been waiting for. It's everything good about James Bond with realism thrown in and you buy every second of Daniel Craig playing a spy. The ending is just perfect, too. One of the loudest appluases I've heard in a theatre.",positive
"Rowr. Daniel Craig. He's not comparable to the other Bonds, because he's entirely different...and yummilicious.",positive
Daniel Craig. Nuff said!,positive
"Best Bond film EVER. You don't think so? I'll fight you to the death, Seriously.",positive
"Finally, we get a Bond film which restores the class and sophistication to the franchise. Away with all the cheesy gadgets and farcical dialogue that the latter films had become entrenched with. Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond is brilliant, and to some extent, almost scary. What we get is a no nonsense character on a learning curve, coming to grips with the ins and outs of being a 00 agent.",negative
"The best Bond film in over a decade. Craig smashes Pierce Brosnan's lilywhite Bond interpretation and gives us a bloody-knuckles, no-nonsense Bond. The opening scene is an instant classic in the Bond series.",positive
"I love James Bond movies, and this one wasn't disappointing.",positive
"I didn't expect much, but really enjoyed it. The best of the recent Bond movies.",positive
the best since goldeneye,negative
"Best Bond film in years. A totally unique, uncompromising vision of the original intent Ian Fleming had when he wrote the novel of the same title. Bond is not all what he seems as a matter of fact... he's downright deadly if you cross him.",positive
I have watched almost all the James Bond movies and this is the best. The chasing scene at the beginning of the movie was the best I have ever seen. I liked that it wasn't cheesy!,positive
Best bond film in 20 years. I think I could say it's probably saved the franchise. Daniel Craig is the perfect Bond. And the opening chase scene is the best one ever.,positive
"James Bond's (Daniel Craig) first 007 mission takes him to Madagascar, where he is to spy on a terrorist Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan). Not everything goes as planned and Bond decides to investigate, independently of the MI6 agency, in order to track down the rest of the terrorist cell. Following a lead to the Bahamas, he encounters Alex Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian) and his girlfriend, Solange (Caterina Murino). He learns that Dimitrios is involved with Le Chiffre (Mad Mikkelsen), banker to the world's terrorist organizations. Secret Service intelligence reveals that Le Chiffre is planning to raise money in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro at Le Casino Royale. MI6 assigns 007 to play against him, knowing that if Le Chiffre loses, it will destroy his organization. 'M' (Judi Dench)places Bond under the watchful eye of the beguiling Vesper Lynd (Eva Green). At first skeptical of what value Vesper can provide, Bond's interest in her deepens as they brave danger together--and even torture at the hands of Le Chiffre. In Montenegro, Bond allies himself with Matthis (Giancarlo Giannin)i, MI6's local field agent, and Felix Leiter(Jeffrey Wright), who is representing the interests of the CIA. The marathon game proceeds with dirty tricks and violence, raising the stakes beyond blood money and reaching a terrifying climax.",positive
Cheers to the sexiest most devastating Bond yet!,positive
"The best of 21 Bond films, without a doubt, without hesitation. Daniel Craig did for Bond what Christian Bale did for Batman: made it real, made it relevant. Connery? Blow me. Moore? Douche. Brosnan? Pussy. You can't hear half the dialogue of this movie because this guy's enormous steel balls are clanging together. CRAIG IS BOND.",positive
"Great Bond movie, one of the best in the frachise.",positive
Best Bond movie ever...,positive
One of my Favorite Bonds,positive
"this was awesome. great for a bond movie, my favorite of the bond's made in my generation.",positive
Daniel Craig is all THAT and a bag of chips. Kudos to the new Bond regime.,positive
Enfin James Bond est pret Ã  se salir... Il ne ressort pas d'une bagarre sans que son costume soit froissÃ©...,positive
This movie was so ridiculously bad that it was good.,negative
Last half-hour was not so good though.,positive
"Bond only has enough time to do three things in this movie: sleep with hot chicks, play poker, and kill people. 5 stars",positive
"Good revamp of the james bond series, especially after die another day.",positive
"Some really great stuff in this film, but an unnecessarily long draw out ending, and an annoying female lead to boot.",negative
"I liked this film because it got back to being about Bond and not his gadgets. For the first time in a long time, Bond is a human being and not a superhero in a tux. Plus the Bond girl, Eva Green, got to do more than hang out in tiny clothes and simper.",negative
"the end surprised me, but it was good",negative
"Mycket bra film, en mörare sida av Bond. Men var verkligen pokerscenen nödvändig?",negative
"This is probably the best Bond film made since Sean Connery retired from 007 status... When I saw the trailer I didn't think that Daniel Craig fit the role of James Bond at all. After the opening sequence at the embassy in Madagascar I was sold. I think that in many ways Daniel Craig fits this role more so than any other actor picked to play Bond by the sheer fact that you believe he could, in all actuality do the things he does in the film. I liked the Pierce Brosnan films, but honestly if Daniel Craig were to slap Pierce upside the head, Pierce would go home crying to his mommy. In conclusion, one of the best, if not the best action films of 2006, and one of the best Bond films ever. If you haven't seen it, go rent it, you won't be disappointed.",positive
The Best James Bond Movie by far!,positive
very nice movie with the usual james bond action. even without the women!,positive
"not a great ""Bond"" movie, but still not bad.",negative
"I'm not a huge Bond fan, but this was good, much grittier than the others, and all the better for it. It loses momentum towards the end.",negative
oh worth watching to see daniel craig in his tighty whiteys,positive
Never knew Clinton Kelley could act!,negative
The best Bond-movie I've seen.,positive
The best bond film so far,positive
"I fancied Daniel Craig long before this, but the shorts help! Excellent action film, truly enjoyable. Although the little tsunami in Venice is a bit OTT.",negative
Lots of gambling scenes,negative
Juste le meilleur de tous !,positive
Where was the action? I nearly wanted to stop watching it. I was glad I got to see it for free and saved my money.,negative
Makes me wanna be a bond girl!,positive
"The first time Bond was convincingly a secret agent - seriously tough, convincing seducer, supremely confident...a real hero/idol.",positive
gr8 film u have to see it,positive
This is the best Bond film I've seen - it keeps the pace going throughout and Daniel Craig makes a very good 007. The fact there's a good old game of poker as well is a definite bonus.,positive
"No disrespect to Connery, but this is what Bond should have been.",positive
bond is back. daniel craig dose it well,positive
Best Bond movie ever,positive
"The story is simple, but this movie isn't about plot so much as it is about the rawness of the Bond character. Spectacular action sequences and no invisible cars (ala Die Another Day).",positive
"This was a fine re-boot but this doesn't feel like a James Bond film. I know they were trying to go in a different direction but this film was lacking the wit and charm of previous Bond movies. Craig has the Bond look but I felt Clive Owen would have made a better Bond. The best thing about this film is the action and stunts, the foot chase is thrilling and awesome. Overall, C.R is a good action movie but not a Bond film, Craig did a decent job but he isn't Connery or Brosnan however the end of the movie makes me intrigued on how they are going to continue.",negative
best since goldeneye,positive
"Bond comes back much better than before. Daniel Craig plays him wonderfully, and the story and action are great. Just would have liked a bigger action scene at the end",negative
"Great reinvention of the Bond franchise. If you are even a remote fan of Bond, see this film ASAP if not sooner!",positive
"well done--gadgets,cars, fight scenes...lotsa bubblegum formy eyes, too!",positive
It got annoyingly boring at the end but I liked it.,negative
"Sexy, sexy James Bond. HOT! HOT! HOT! Orginal J.B. fans, beware, it won't be your favorite.",negative
This is a great relaunch.,positive
best bond since GoldenEye at least!,positive
"what's with the big shit bit in the middle, the bourne trilogy raised the bar on these types of movies",negative
"to me this ones the best ov da series, though the guy dont fit the traditional bond profile..",positive
saw it twice in 4 weeks- good story good actors great action. Made Bourne look tame.,positive
Casino Royale - First outing for Daniel Craig. Great movie too. Waiting for the next Bond movie Daniel.,positive
will always love bond,negative
"Not bad, different from the other Bond movies. Worth a watch",negative
"A great entry into the Bond franchise, and a stellar new Bond in Daniel Craig... The opening action sequence - in which Bond pursues a free-running bomb maker [played by Sebastien Foucan, the creator of free running] through a construction site to the sovereign territory of an embassy - is breath taking... This is much closer to the tenor of Ian Fleming's novels... gone is the over the top gimmickry (remember the cheesy rocket backpack in Goldfinger? Or the submersible car in ""Spy who Loved Me""?, or *groan"" the invisible(?) car in the appalling ""Die Another Day""?) and the unrealistic cornball laughs (remember Roger Moore crossing a river by running across a bridge of alligators, or driving a gondola on dry land?)... while there are still some cool Bond toys, this film basically jettisons these flaws for a humor that's a bit darker and a style far more gritty... this Bond is tortured (as in the novel) - something the impassible Bond of past years would never have been exposed to... Daniel Craig is pretty cool - he plays Bond as a cold, hard, arrogant sod, a physically menacing, supremely confident killer... Craig is a great choice for Bond - he's as cool as Connery (in a different way), has a touch of Moore's suavity, is darker than Dalton, and more physical than Brosnan... the 6 foot, blonde haired blue-eyed Englishman is a great choice to fill the screen shoes of Ian Flemings literary hero... The action is torrid and the violence has a dirty realism about it... However, there are some weaknesses...for example, some of the romantic dialogue is just plain awful, e.g. VESPER: ""If the only thing left of you was your smile and your little finger, you'd still be more of a man than anyone I've ever known"" Groan-out-loud... or there's Bond's efforts at announcing his undying love... BOND: ""I have no armour left. You've stripped it from me. Whatever is left of me - whatever is left of me - whatever I am - I'm yours."" Geez - gimme a break... it's as laughable and banal as Anakin and Padme's ""romantic"" dialogue in ""Attack of the Clones""... but don't tell Bond I said that... Also, parts of the story don't make sense in the film, such as the mention of an organisation behind the hit on Le Chiffre and the late double cross... the identity of this ""organisation"" is left hanging in the film, which leaves the story feeling a little 'unfinished'... the novel names the group as SMERSH, a a Soviet counter-intelligence agency [a conjunction of two Russian words: ""Ð¡Ð¼ÐµÑÑÑ Ð¨Ð¿Ð¸Ð¾Ð½Ð°Ð¼""-""SmÄrt Å pionam"", which means ""Death to Spies""]. Another weakness was the lack of John Barry's uber-cool ""James Bond"" theme... how can it be Bond with out that twanging electric guitar and booming brass section? Still... I liked it; there's something cool about this approach that breathed some new life into the old franchise. The emotionally vulnerable Bond was something different, and only seen before as 007 grieved his dead wife in ""In Her Majesty's Secret Service""... I'd love to see them remake the films (in order of the novel's publication - ""Live and Let Die"" next!!) in this new style - now, that would be cool...",negative
Daniel Craig... aaah! Ehdottomasti paras Bond-leffa ikinÃ¤,positive
"Pretty good... Awesome stunts, too much poker...",negative
I think people know this one.,positive
I wrote my Master's thesis of this. Should I say more?,positive
Better than hoped. Brought back a bond with a bit of pig in him.,negative
"Bond is bigger, better and knows how to kick ass. The true second coming of the franchise.",positive
"BIG budget, BIG story, MASSIVE thrills!!! The film barely gives you a moment to catch your breath before the next big budget, thrilling action sequence. The best Bond in years!",positive
First viewing was about a 3. But then it got better... ish.,negative
Great movie! This is an entirely different Bond flick. Was well done.,positive
One of the best Bond films. Its gritty and Craig plays a Bond whose not afraid of being unlikable now and then. Brilliant!,positive
better than I excpected from Daniel Craig. i'm looking forward to the next one.,positive
"Finally, a James Bond movie that I really loved. Throws all the silliness out the window and makes Bond tough, clever, and flawed. One of the best action/spy movies to come out in a while.",positive
Daniel Craig as James Bond definitely helps me forget about Pierce Brosnan. I like the cycnicism that Craig brings to the Bond character.,negative
Best Bond ever. This flick is action packed and in pace with the trends of the time. Poker element brought yet again another reminder to the composure of Bond even though Bond was shown in this movie as more savage than ever. Nice.,positive
"my favorite bond movie. i was skeptical of daniel craig playing bond, but he won me over in this movie.",positive
Daniel Craig is challenging Sean Connery for 'Best Bond Ever'. He's no oil painting but his on-screen presence is captivating.,positive
"Great movie and for me one of the best Bond films, Craig did an awesome job as Bond.",positive
"I'm not a Bond fan, but this movie was undeniably awesome.",positive
one of the best bonds ever,positive
"Hot, action-packed, romantic in a cunning way...Poor Bond, no wonder he doesn't trust women.",positive
James Bond is almost as cool as Chuck Norris now.,positive
"Okay, so I secretly love Bond movies. But this was just great. If I had money, I'd probably own it.",positive
"James Bond before he was the man. Excellent story, and pacing. Good snappy lines and Daniel Craig makes a DAMN good Bond.",positive
Finally a great James Bond movie!,positive
i have to say this is probably my secound favorite bond movie cause it is actually good,positive
"I'm a loyal Sean Connery fan, but this may be one of the best Bond films yet.....almost.",positive
probably the best bond film to date. Craig makes an AMAZING Bond,positive
best bond yet. different and original from the rest.,positive
"Prefiero a este 007, q a Pierce Brosnan. digo Sean Connery es el mejor",positive
Really enjoyable film but come on it seems like everyone gets the greatest hands in poker with ease.,negative
"Enfin un James Bond rÃ©aliste. Fuck sont apparence physique la, l'espion est enfin plausible. J'ai mal aux couilles (allez le voir vous comrpendrez).",positive
Loved this! Haven't seen a Bond flick this good since the Connery years.,positive
"never thought i'd love another bond after sean connery, but daniel craig gets the job done! pleasantly surprised.",positive
one of the best movies of 2006 and part to next year should be gr8 could do wid a longer car scene but its a proper bond film!!!,positive
Best Bond since Goldfinger.,positive
Finally a James Bond actor worthy of the likes of Moore and Connery,positive
like Daniel as Bond...he's nice and moody.....,negative
the begining is crazy !,positive
who said bond couldn't be blonde! Amazing!,positive
"Definitely the best James Bond movie released so far, though not a fantastic movie",positive
Can't beat Bond and for all those who said it wasn't a proper Bond film isn't it the point that he would be different as it is pretty much a prequel to everything we've seen before. Sorry little rant.,positive
best bond in YEARS!!!,positive
"I'd say this is the best 007 film so far. I won't go as far as saying Craig makes a better Bond than Connery did, but he's pretty damn close.",positive
plenty of good action... nicely done action flick. the new james bond guy does a good job.,positive
The only Bond movie I've seen all the way through.,positive
"wasnt expecting much, but really impressive. daniel craig is an excellent bond!",positive
A great re-start. Craig might not have the look but he's got the attitude,positive
"good movie, bit confused at first, then realised it was the first bond movie. He is hot and has really blue eye!!",positive
Top 100: #76 Best Bond movie since Goldfinger. I for one applauded the director's decission to part ways from the recently deceased franchise. Die Another Day is a travesty and with that I thought it was fitting to reinvent the franchise. Daniel Craig is a rising superstar and next to Connery the most talented guy to don the tux.,positive
The best James Bond film ever made.,positive
Pierce Brosnan is sooooooo much better! The ultimate James Bond!,negative
Great action flick. Daniel Craig... so0o0o,positive
The bond film we had all be waiting for after prosnans happy go lucky camp and unrealistic die another day. Bond has finaly been brought to life.,positive
This is the best James Bond movie to date. Craig plays a darker style of Bond. From the begining chase sequence to the end it had my attention,negative
I breath of fresh air for all of us who really don't like Pierce Brosnan,positive
Un des meilleur Bond a date. Daniel Craig est excellent,positive
One of the best bond-movies. Craig is more brutal... and works with his hands more than other Bond-characters.,positive
Different - and the Best of all.,positive
TyylikÃ¤s. MÃ¤ niin tykkÃ¤Ã¤n nÃ¤istÃ¤ Bond-elokuvista.,positive
"""Vous avez certainement cru que je bluffais, Monsieur Bond.""",negative
"yeah, i was suprised at how i didnt puke at this movie. The story was good but i hate this James.",negative
This is what is all about. Finally we get to feel what being James Bond 007 is like. Daniel Craig is staggeringly better than expected and in the process made me change my opinion of Brosnan Bond 180 degrees from good to bad. Lets hope the next one is just as good.,positive
"as a big bond fan, i was not really looking forward to this installment. truly one of the best so far though, especially after the last couple of stinkers. looking forward to the next.",positive
I want Pierce Brosnan back,negative
"Yes, the poker scene is a little lame....but everything else is packed full of action. This is a contemporary James Bond.",negative
The advent of the 'Bourne' franchise pushes the new 007 to heights surpassed only by a few of the Connery classics.,positive
One of the best Bond movies ever made.,positive
i have to admit that i'm a Pierce Brosnan fan n i loved him as 007 but Craig wasn't bad either.,positive
The best bond in a decade. The two opening sequences put you on the edge of your seat and accurately give you a portrait of what you're in for. Daniel Craig is the most unpredictable bond since Connery.,positive
The coldest blood runs through my veins!!,positive
One of my favorite films....love it!,positive
"Yeah, this movie is totally off the freakin chain! I cannot watch this movie enough. Everything about this movie was good. The action, the girls, the acting. Fantastic and my favorite Bond hands down!",positive
"Awesome - plot, effects and Daniel Craig",positive
"I grew up a huge fan of the Bond movies. This one is the best of all of them, and holds pretty close to the book.",positive
One of the best Bonds,positive
best bond movie in a long time. I look forward to his future bond movies.,positive
My favourite James Bond movie.,positive
"Darkly good, drawn out relationship with the-love-interest but ""that explains why he never gets close to women"".",positive
"I never was a Bond fan, but Craig and Casino make me re-think... perhaps because this film is not too 007-like at all.",positive
"daniel craig is hot,hot hot, the movie is good too.",positive
Craig defines Bond over the course of this film. The romance is so intelligently included - illustrated like one of Shakespear's plays. A timeless Bond film.,positive
I'm inclined to agree with people when they say Daniel Craig is the best James Bond ever.,positive
very shallow I know but....daniel craig........yummy yummy,positive
Almost slipped right off my seat waching Daniel Craig,positive
"best bond ever, awesome film",positive
This Bond is Hottt..there is no comparison to his 'coolness quotient'..the story is very..er..bond..,positive
mmmmm... :-) subverted Bond,positive
best bond film in a long while even if it is a remake,positive
I really enjoyed this film.,positive
One of the best movie of the Ian Fleming franchise.,positive
"Never liked James Bond movies... but this one is different. New blond Bond adds a new touch to, otherwise boring series.",positive
"A newer, updated Bond battles with card sharks, bombers, bathroom stalls and spiked martinis. Bond reinvented ends up being a thoroughly enjoyable film leaving the audience eager for his second outing.",positive
"It was good, but I really didn't feel like watching poker for half an hour. Oh, and Bond was a complete sociopath in this film.",negative
"When I saw the trailer, I thought that the main actor is the worst James Bond I have ever seen. But after seeing the movie, he actually did a pretty good job in it.",negative
In France they call this one Casino Quarter Pounder.,positive
This was the first James Bond movie I ever liked,positive
It put me to sleep on a flight.,negative
i don't like james bond moves. i loved this movie. daniel craig brings sexy back to bond. and i wanna learn how to free run.,positive
Man this bond movie was boring ...,negative
"Great way to transition to the new Bond, start over at the beginning.",positive
Best opening Bond scene ever!,positive
"An unexpected but pleasant ""re-boot"" of 007 - a much needed one since the franchise was getting fat and old. Brilliant!",positive
"Great opening scene. If you are a fan of free running, thou shalt appreciate. I jst can't believe that a white guy could actually chase down a black guy. Otherwise, this was the worst James Bond movie ever. Worse than License to Kill with Timothy Dalton. The Bond Girl had too much make-up.",negative
THE BEST BOND FILM...EVER!!!,positive
a man can only dream of getting those kinds of poker hands,positive
Without a doubt the best Bond movie. It beats the ones with Pierce Brosnan easily. Daniel Craig is the best actor to portray Bond.,positive
First off... DANIEL CRAIG! Yum!! What a Bond! The only Bond I will sit thru and actually enjoyed enough to buy!!,positive
Best Bond movie EVER!,positive
Frekin rocked my sox off,positive
Craig does a great job and proves he can do Bond.,negative
"Bond. James Bond. Action rocked, suspense rocked, actors rocked, even the romance rocked. All in all, this movie rocked",positive
"No Bond movie has been worth seeing since Goldeneye, and this movie saved the series.",positive
This is what James Bond was meant to be.,positive
best bond in a long time,positive
Best bond movie ever,positive
"The James Bond franchise needed a strong recovery after ""Die Another Day"" and it got just that from Casino Royale, a nice return to the classic style of James Bond from the outlandish sci-fi that it had resorted to.",positive
Awesome reinvention of the classic spy. One of only two remakes that I like better than the originals.,positive
I like this movie. It kind of fitz me.,positive
OH YAH! This movie rules!!! BEST James Bond movie ever made!,positive
How could they make me like 007 again? This is how. This one is so much fun and still has it's dark moments. And lots of action.,positive
"First off, I'm huge Bond fan. Ever since I first watched Goldeneye I have been hooked. I was skeptical when I heard Daniel Craig would be taking over the moniker of 007, but this movie came through in spades and I can't wait to see the next one.",positive
Maybe the best 007 yet.,positive
"I just drooled my way through this movie.... Best Bond ever! Did I say Daniel Craig goes swimming?...mmm...Oh where was I? Yes, great action for the boys too!",positive
"An hour of Bond playing cards, then he falls in love like a sissy and the ending is tacked on out of nowhere. I prefer Bond films where he smacks the women about",negative
A much better comeback for Bond than I thought...yet it seemed a bit on the softer side for James Bond,negative
Best bond?? All the others are so cliched!,positive
One of the best 007 movies..Daniel Craig is absolutely fit in the role...,positive
I am a James Bond fan and I really liked this movie. It showed a whole other side of bond. After seeing this I look forward to seeing the next one that they redo.,positive
I love Daniel Craig at 007. This is a brilliant film of the first Ian Fleming book of how James Bond gets his license to kill - a must see and a fantatic addition to the Bond collection... Looking forward to seeing more of Craig as 007 !,positive
Undoubtly my favourite 007 movie. Daniel Craig is hotter than hot,positive
"If you want to be entertained, watch this!",positive
Good bond film but not as god as i could of been with the story they had to work with.,negative
How much fun is this movie?! Its so awesome and so much fun!!!,positive
Excellent Bond movie for a while,positive
One of the best bonds yet... Daniel Craig has stolen my heart.,positive
All the praise for Daniel Craig's debut as Bond is justly deserved. This reboot to the Bond series is a fantastic return to the tone and style of the classic Connery outings. One of the best in the series.,positive
"A new kinda cold-hearted Bond, with the style of the 21st millennium. Promising a better tomorrow for the movie series that was thought to have seen it's prime.",positive
"The best Bond movie, ever!",positive
Daniel Craig looked amazing on the beach in that speedo.,negative
as i said before i hate james bond but the stunts in this one are pretty good at the beggining,negative
Best Bond movie so far!,positive
Interesting plot for a 007 movie,positive
yummy...not a fan of the bond movies but this one shows a real character and some feelings,positive
one of the best bond movies in ages! more realistic and true to book. Also turned out daniel craig wasnt a bad choice after all.,positive
OMG Daniel Craig is the epitome of Bond. So hot.,positive
Daniel Craig-mmmmm Great flick but the opening scene suspends reality way too far for me.,negative
Daniel craig is hot hot hot!!!,positive
"The best Bond by far, Daniel Craig has reignited the series with his stand out performance. The storyline is sharp with a cople of twists and turns but unfortunately not quite as good as the third Bourne film",positive
This film didn't really grab me! The airport action scene was good but the casino bit was just boring!!,negative
"best bond ever,,by far",positive
Worst James Bond movie on record.,negative
"A great Bond film. The last few Bond films haven't been too impressive, so it's a welcoming change. It shows a more ""human"" side of Bond.",positive
James Bond the way he's meant to be.,positive
"Everyone said they liked this one more than the other Bonds because it was so much more gritty. And, yeah, I liked it too, but I'm a sucker for the hot cars with rockets and silly gadgets that come in handy at the perfect time. This lacked that.",positive
"Who said that Daniel Craig would be a crap, blonde Bond? I hope they're eating their hat. This is a definite revival of the franchise with orgasmic cinematography, pretty women, hot action and so much suave style. Wasn't that the way it was meant to be? Can't wait for Bond 22.",positive
"absolutely raw, harsh, pure agent",positive
craig makes brosnan look like a wimp! undoubtedly the best bond film of the modern era!,positive
Har sett den drit bra..,positive
i normally don't like james bond films at all. and i don't like daniel craig. but eva green made up for it.,negative
"Fantastic, exhilarating and Daniel Craig is awesome as James Bond",positive
"Best bond ever, action felt mature & gruesome...24 meets mission impossible. Superb",positive
The way James Bond should be.,positive
not that good not that bad,negative
Étonnant. Époustouflant. Renversant.,positive
"Wow, this movie was such a gamble and alotta people were betting against it, but it proved all of us wrong. It is my favorite Bond film ever and the gorgeous Eva Green is the epitimy of all things sexy...did I mentioned she's so HOT! Call me!",positive
very nice bond movie. I liked how it had a dark side to it,positive
"Casino Royale was actually *never supposed to be made into a movie* because Ian Fleming did not want it to be. But they went back and got the rights because they ditched Pierce and had no other ideas. BUT, I have to say they did a pretty damn good job and Daniel Craig is a whole new (and sexy) Bond with a completely new identity. There's going to be a sequel...I'm there.",positive
I never really liked bond all that much before this.,positive
A great re-vamp of the Bond series. Non-stop action sequences and some of the best stuntwork I have EVER seen. See this movie!,positive
"One of the best Bond movie ever and also one of the most realistic. The ending could throw you off at first but the more you watch it, the more you see how the ending is awesome!",positive
Man I love this movie. It may be long but not a single second goes by that I wasnât fully paying attention. I canât wait for the sequel; I just hope they keep Bond as great as they did in this film.,positive
"To all the Daniel Craig naysayers, what say you now?",positive
this is the best Bond movie ever! I think Daniel Craig is better than Pierece Brosnan.,positive
"Excellent script, directing and editing. Initially when I read that Daniel Craig was going to be cast as Bond, I didn't think it was a good choice - he pleasantly surprised me.",positive
"The movie is a bit long, but holy crap is it good. It has the best chase scene I have ever seen in a movie by far. It's just an amazing movie and you need to see it.",positive
"Bond is back - with style! Discarding the age-old 'Superspy with toys ala. Batman' angle, this was instead a darker, grittier Bond. More assassin than spy. Great direction for the franchise to take, makes me keen for the sequel.",negative
"The best Bond film so far. Daniel Craig and Eva Green have amazing chemistry and she's much more than just a ""Bond girl"".",positive
"This is by far, the best James Bond movie EVER. Also, it's one of my favorite movies ever. This is why I spend 9 bucks to see movies!",positive
Surprisingly gritty for a Bond flick with some brilliant action sequences.,negative
Excellent movie. Easily the best James Bond film to date. It didn't have all of the comic goofiness usually associated with the films done by Sean Connery but it had more of an edge.,positive
"Best James Bond, after On HEr Majesty`s Secret Service",positive
"This is the best James Bond movie to date, and Craig erased any doubts I had about him taking over for Brosnan.",positive
"Daniel Craig is not much of a james bond, this movie would have been excellent if it were not named for james bond... when you hear the name James Bond, you think high tech spy gadgets, over the top villians with over elaberate world domination plans, and the cunningness of the main character, The one and only, James Bond. This movie gives you a renegade spy, that acts like a complete hard ass know it all. Not at all like the James Bond from the other films",negative
the worst bond movie,negative
I like the revamped Bond. They need to back this one up with a another corker.,positive
It's ok. Entertaining. What really captured my intention is opening scene with the Bond trying to catch a guy running away and pursuing him on differnet obstacles. I found out this activity is called parcours and started in the suburbs of Paris. You can find some amazing videos of this on youtube,negative
"A typical Bond film obviously: exciting chase scenes, beautiful girls, amazing cars to be smashed...but it's the best of recent ones. I had doubt about Daniel Craig as Bond but I think I won't miss Brosnan now.",negative
Crap. He should be banned from James Bond Movies !,negative
"Awesome, gave Bond some much needed new life.",positive
De retour au bon James Bond,positive
Craig is incredible in his Bond beginning.,positive
"Wow, what can I say...I dont watch many films more than once but this has to be watched at least 5 times just because. Daniel Craig if you didnt already know is sooooo lovely, may go find my DVD of it now.",positive
"Daniel Craig is ruthless, just how he should be",positive
"fast-moving, satisfying",positive
Buena pero no es la mejor de James Bond.,negative
Now my favorite Bond film.,positive
The best bond movie yet. in my opinion. Kickass action sequences and fantastic acting. One of my absolute favorites!,positive
"Best bond ever probably - fresh concept, character and story, with the best stunts yet. Grittty uncliched and yes I'll say it - believable (which is silly) but great stuff.",positive
"James Bond is back!! I'm in love with him all over again. Pierce Brosnan was not bad at all, but the poor guy was really making poor James Bond Movies. This one rocks!!",positive
Definitely the best Bond movie in my mind. This had some sense in it.,positive
This is f***ing AWESOME!!,positive
Daniel Creg..my favorite bond,positive
"My favorite Bond movie. Daniel Craig is undoubtedly the best actor to play Bond. The action was solid, the plot was solid, the acting was phenomenal. The only reason it doesn't get a little higher of a rating was its runtime which was far too long. It needed to shave off about 20 minutes of filler footage because you can really feel it sag in the middle. But completely solid.",positive
"Epic stuff. Daniel Craig is brilliant as the new Bond. Awesome film, apart from having Sony logos plastered all over it at every single opportunity.",positive
"This was the first proper Bond movie I saw, Now I love them",positive
Please remake all the Bond films with Daniel Craig. I promise to watch each and every one. Excellent.,positive
quel corps... quelles cascades...,positive
was a decent reboot to a series that didn't really need a reboot... Connery should still be bond in my opinion,negative
"Spectacular. I am a James Bond fan, and I was glad we finally moved away from the fancy technology showdowns. James Bond doesn't need a high-tech car to do his job. Although, this movie doesn't have a car chase at all...is this really a Bond movie?",positive
Totally blew me away - I wasn't expecting to like it or Daniel Craig that much but loved it! Bears repeated watching too - always the mark of a good Bond film!,positive
At last a Bond film I won't mind having to watch 100's of times.,positive
"One of the best, if not the best Bond film yet.",negative
the best bond movie there is,positive
so different and not in a bad way,negative
beste bond filmen e har sett :),positive
"daniel craig ooooh, bond, oooooh",positive
in Montenegro ofcourse its good ;-),positive
Great reinvention for a series which had become a little too repetitive and predicatble. Craig does a v.good job as bond and although the stories wasn't concluded (with the cliffhanger not that engaging) it's certainly good for at least one watch.,negative
"Daniel Craig IS James Bond. If you aren't hooked in the first 15 minutes, check your pulse. A welcomed restart to the series after years of mediocrity.",positive
This is by far my favorite movie with Daniel Craig.,positive
Possibly the best ever Bond. Right up there with Geldfinger and Live and Let Die.,positive
"James Bond saga at its best. Daniel Craig was awesome playing the 007 agent, investigating a dangerious arms dealer. I thought it was exciting to watch especially the stunts and fight scence.",positive
"""sexy the only 007 worth watching""",positive
Den bÃ¤sta bondfilmen hittills. Sug pÃ¥ den :),positive
"Un superbe enieme jeunesse pour James, et meme si avant le film je trouvais le changement d'acteur vraiment nul, au final j'ai Ã©tÃ© subjuguÃ© par la justesse de Daniel Craig. J'espere quil va rester longtemps 007 ...",positive
Enjoyed the new James Bond's piercing blue eyes,positive
"I have never been a massive fan of Bond flicks, but this one has completely converted me. Slick, shiny cinematography, all things needed to make a ""good"" modern day film, and yet extremely devoted to being a Bond film. I always thought the more modern Bonds were slightly ridiculous, which is why this film surpassed all of my expectations. I might give the Bond films another chance.",positive
puts all the other bond movies to shame,positive
"Definitely an improvement on the last lot of garbage Brosnan has presented us. Now don't get me wrong, Brosnan was a good Bond, but Goldeneye was his only decent movie, unfortunately.",positive
"Bond is back after the worst Bond movie ever made ""Die Another Day"". More!",negative
Loved it! The best Bond movie yet. Daniel Craig was excellent.,positive
So many Jaguars in this movie <3,positive
Paras Bond kaikista!! =),positive
Better than any other Bond film I've seen,negative
Real Superman & definition of love,positive
"A difficult one this. Undoubtably a very good film, well acted, scripted and directed. But as a Bond film? It misses much",negative
LOVED IT! I didn't really think this film would be too good but wowwww! Daniel Craig is an ace actor and even though he is a blond bond he's pretty good looking!,positive
"Sorry, Bond-inites, but rater than a ""restart"", this was even worse than imagineable.",negative
"Oh no, someone destroyed the Bond franchise. Surely the fans will rise up... wait, you like it? Was it the ball torture or the 15 endings? Maybe you're all just fans of World Championship Poker, because that's all this is, except more boring.",negative
"Very well done. I haven't seen any bond films since Sean Connery, so can't really compare. But, it is very true to the 007 genre. The action is exquisite, the story line very clever, and the lead staunch and intrepid",positive
Didn't knonw what to expect and Daniel Craig certainly had a lot to prove in this one . But I think he did extremely well as Bond. The rest is almost all the usual stuff but I enjoyed it. Not sure about the 'ball scratching' bit though... Was it really necesary?,positive
"A great re-imagining and update of the Bond franchise...with a great new lead actor, a beautiful counterpart in the lovely Mrs. Eva Green..and a killer David Arnold score!",positive
"Welcome back, danger and (more) probable storyline. Missed you in the last few Bond movies.",negative
i dont like bond movies but this one was great,positive
It was pretty dam good! It had heaps of good climaxes and stayed reasonably exciting throuout the whole thing. But at the end it got really slow...and a bit weird,positive
"Daniel Craig's performance was absolutely riveting!!! The best bond yet. It will leave you shaken, stirred and definately blown away.",positive
Terrible. Absolutely not a Bond flick and plays off the popularity of Texas hold'em. There weren't any gadgets (my favorite parts of any Bond flick) and the car gets wrecked after being used for less than ten seconds.,negative
"A good action film but by far a stain on the James Bond series. Forget cool, classy lines as they've been replaced by hot-tempered ruthlessnes.",negative
I don't think I ever enjoyed a Bond movie this MUCH! First of all Daneil Craig is a bad ass. Not cheesy like the other Bonds.,positive
"Too long, too dull. worst bond movie yet",negative
Muutti suhtautumiseni Bond-leffoihin tÃ¤ysin.Toiv suunta jatkuu samanlaisena!vÃ¤hemmÃ¤n seksistinen.,positive
"Daniel Craig suited the part well. They just get better and better, with the exception of Timothy Dalton. Casino Royale is just entertaining from the start to the end. Looking forward to the next.",positive
best modern Bond movie. Defenetly a mush watch.,positive
The best Bond movie yet!!! I wonder how the 22th Bond movie would turn out.........,positive
Worst James bond movie ever!,negative
I really wanted to hate Daniel Craig as James Bond but he was amazing. My only complaint was the MASSIVE amount of sony product placement in this movie. They seriously should have called it Casony Royale,positive
"Best Bond movie and Daniel Craig was awesome, screw all his naysayers.",positive
"Trim off the last 45 minutes and you have the best Bond film ever, but in the end we just have a pretty good one.",negative
"Daniel Craig is a great bond. Found the story a little predictable (never saw the original) but good acting and some good stuntwork. Confound those British accents, though!",positive
"my favorite bond movie yet and i was very loyal to pierce brosnan (the last bond). more gritty with less gadgets, but they will probably start going back a bit more towards that route after a few more bond movies go by. this one is great though. daniel craig has to be laughing at all the critics",positive
Bond is NOT BLONDE!!! Even if the movie was good. 3 1/2 stars for effort and FX.,negative
"This is the best Bond movie yet! I liked everything about it from the opening rotoscoped animation to Chris Cornell's music at the end credits. Daniel Craig's Bond was a complete action hero, combining brains for the high stakes poker game and brawn for the violent melees. The action scenes were well choreographed, especially the free running (not to be confused w/ parkour) sequence with Sebastien Foucan.",positive
this is the movie thats gonna get me hooked on the bond films from now on!!!!,positive
Bond is Back. What more is there to say?,positive
Best James Bond ever! Daniel Craig is better than Pierce Brosnan!,negative
The new Bond fits the part and puts the most recent Bond to shame. I really enjoyed the movie and I'm very hopeful for the next Daniel Craig film.,positive
Great movie!!! One of the best Bond movies made!!!,positive
"Great Bond. Hard core, roots-bound movie. Not a lot of show or excessive wit, just bad ass Bond",positive
I love this movie!!! It's the best Bond movie I've seen. I know I'll keep watching these new James Bond movies if Daniel Craig is in them. He's like the hottest Bond ever!!!!! He's got a grr-eat!! body (te he) Spoiler: I'm glad the girl dies in the end!!!!,positive
"The first hour is pulse pounding excitement, the casino stuff's ok, but slows it down so much even the exploding buildings didn't get my adrenailne back up, and the switch from Vesper seducing him then betraying him was hugely unconvincing, and Craig (despite the hysterical rantings of journalists) isn't a great Bond, he just didn't quite fit (fine actor that he is).",negative
"Great return of Bond, Daniel Craig may not look like Bond, but he kicks ass like Bond",positive
Just excellent. The opening scene rocked my face off.,positive
James Blond? He's alright. It's alright. It even veers into good regularly...But it's not Clive Owen :-(,negative
"My first James Bond movie, and I loved it.",positive
The chase scene in the beginning is amazing... And how wonderful this movie is in 1080p!!,positive
"So good. Great action. And Daniel Craig's not bad, either.",positive
"duh, James Bond movies!",negative
"its one of the besat bond movie ever made. this film is my beast bond movie ever, have seen. see this movie.",positive
Best Bond movie ever.. I just looove Mads Mikkelsen :)),positive
pretty good...Eva Green is one sizzlin babe with brains,positive
"nice one, but he is NOT James Bond!",negative
The best James Bond yet! More adventure flick than spy film for sure.,positive
"at last a bond film with some guts... and despite the pouting from DC, plenty of drooling! the swimwear was a bit blatant, much prefer mr craig with clothes on! need to leave SOMETHING to the imagination...",positive
THE BEST YET! (although I wish he wasn't quite so blond),positive
"Best Bond movie ever. This is a grittier, more serious Bond, and Eva Green is the only Bond girl that has a brain. The action, the acting, the score . . . wow! Can't wait to see more of Craig as Bond.",positive
One of the best Bond movies.,positive
HOLY CRAP!!! Best Bond movie EVER!!!,positive
Daniel Craig what a sexy Bond!,positive
Best Bond since Sean Connery. Follows the book character very closely.,positive
"James Bond Begins is everithing we could expect. Craig hit the spot of what Flemming intended to do with Bond, and Campbell Direct a near perfect introduction of a new actor. For queen and contry!!!",positive
"Although I grew up with Bonds like in the Man with the Golden Gun, this movie surpasses them all. It reinvents the genre, raises it to a more mature level. Daniel Craig is not your typical Bond stereotype and that's a good thing in this case. Underestimate him. He'll keep you on the edge of your seat.",positive
Not one redeeming feature... Except that it came free with the PS3 so I didn't have to pay for it.,negative
"Wonderful new blood into the bond franchaise just as it was beginning to fade. Daniel craig brings another dimension to bond, one who is not emotinally shallow and one who actually bleeds after a good old fist cuff! Amazing action sequences and locations.",positive
"Brought Bond back to life as a hard as nails, kick ass, woman hunry, handsome, ruthless barstard. Fantastic. Bring on the next one from a new (nearly) hero!",positive
"Ehdottomasti paras Bond-leffa ikinÃ¤! eikÃ¤ vÃ¤hiten niiden pikku uimahousujen takia, ah ;)",positive
"One of my favorite action films, soley based on the scenic views and lavish buildings. It was a very, very classy film.",positive
Typical Action movie with JAMES BOND's tast !!,positive
"A different approach to Bond's persona,very original.",positive
The best 007 movie since Roger Moore,positive
better then i thought but not waht i wanted (i think clive owen would make a better james bond),positive
"Who would of thought Daniel Craig would make a good bond, best bond film since the Roger Moore days",positive
"Det er faktisk en af de bedste Bond, Sean Connery skal stå tidligt op og have den gode toupé på for at være med her",positive
Bond is back and better than ever,positive
"BOND IS BACK! This is a great start and great direction for the new bond film. It was slick it was fun, it payed homage to the original films. And the Parcour scenes where Phenomenal. I wish i could do that stuff. COOL!",positive
This is my new favorite James Bond film. Daniel Craig completely reinvents the character in to a spy of the real world. The action sequences are outstanding but the movies best moments involve a tense card game between Bond and the films villain. This is the first 007 movie where I actually cared deeply about the characters and their personal outcomes.,positive
Completely new style for Bond movies. Very rough-around-the-edges 007. Best ever?,positive
the best bond of them all!,positive
The greatest James Bond movie I have ever seen!,positive
Easily the best Bond ever. I loved every minute of this movie.,positive
Bad ass Bad ass Bad ass..... okay one more time... Bad ass. Best Bond flick.,positive
"An ok Bond movie, I want to see how the others of this new bond go.",negative
Really i just love the chase toward the middle. mega sweet,positive
first date with ms.clark,positive
Daniel Craig is the best James Bond of all time. Can't wait for the next one.,positive
"Real actions of Bond, and Daniel Craig is super cool! You won't know the truth until the end, it is the most mysterious and romantic 007 movie for me.",positive
"a full fucking retro-fit, the best bond since connery.",positive
"Boy, was I getting sick of Bond films. Until this one. Regardless of whether or not it is a good movie, it was just nice to see something new in the series. In addition, I thought it was a good movie in its own right.",positive
One of the best bond films yet!,positive
"excellent fresh reboot for the bond series, even if it borrows a lot from bourne. best bond since goldeneye.",positive
Pretty cool but James Bond still sucks.,negative
"James Bond + hardcore action = great success, obviously. I hope to see more of Daniel Craig.",positive
"Action from the first scene to the last. Certainly one of the best Bond films in recent memory, the blonde Bond hits back at his critics with a very good performance..Not in Pierce Brosnan's league yet, but the early signs are impressive",positive
"Not bad for a Bond film, but why does it suddenly turn into a romance for 20 minutes?",negative
intensa super brutal me encanta,positive
A predictable movie but a decently good watch. A bit overrated however,negative
DAMN!! This movie is AH-mazing,positive
Daniel Craig is a damn good Bond.,negative
Daniel Craig is wasted on this film. His performance is the only thing that made it more than mediocre.,negative
"A thriller. A typical Bond movie, but better! It's not every day you see that, so make the most of it. We all love Daniel Craig!",positive
how good was daniel craig?,positive
"IMHO, the very best of the Bond-films, although hardly even competing in the same series...",positive
"More brutal, feels like it´s supposed to do: natural. Love this film, just can´t wait to see the next one By far the best Bond movie ever, and I´ve grown up with them!",positive
"I didnt like it at all, but I have never liked any Bond mvoies. Tried watching this but I just got bored.",negative
"As Bond struggles to stay alive after ingesting a poisoned martini, I was struck by how perfect this one scene captured the whole of the Casino Royale experience. Brutal intensity.",positive
I like this sexy new bond...,positive
"Daniel Craig is a geat bond, but no replace men for Sean Connery. Daniel Craig out does all previous bond movies that did have Sean Connery in it.",positive
decent bond movie but ive seen better,negative
How James became Bond....,negative
"Bond is back. And in what shape! Better than ever. Mr Craig is perfect as Bond. Go see it right away. IÂ´m longing for the next one. Eva Green is excellent as Vesper. Judi Dench never disappoints you and the great dane, Mads Mikkelsen i a really cool villain. Highly recommended.",positive
"A break from the usual 007 films, this is well worth watching; even putting aside the tiny few moments of poor acting from Daniel Craig.",positive
"Great realistic feel and style to the film, but just a tad too much on the dark side",positive
The best bond film to date.,positive
"Reboot the Bond franchise, why don't ya.",positive
"This is Bond reborn, filled with heart racing action scenes, great dialogue, and if that isn't enough for you... Eva Green is in it. Simply unmissable.",positive
My favorite Bond Flick,positive
The best 007 after Sean Connery!,positive
This Bond has revolutionised the bond films. Daniel Craig was the perfect choice and plays the charactor very well. Stunts just get better and better and the opening scene and the car crash have you on the edge of your seat!,positive
the best bond in years! and Craig is the second best Bond behind Connery. You really feel like this guy could actually kill you and not give a shit!,positive
"I confess to have only been able to watch the first twenty-five minutes of this movie before I walked out in disgust. If you like gratuitous violence, incomprehensible plotting, comic book characters and the full gamut of action movie clichÃ©s then Casino Royale is for you. The film has been superbly marketed and will no doubt pander brilliantly to the facile tastes of those that think that murder and mayhem is fun, and who want to suspend reality. I am sure that the film will be a huge commercial success. But I found it vile and a deeply saddening refection of what is the public's taste in the 21st Century. Does it matter that the world's twelve-year-olds will be going in large numbers to see this trivial little film? I think that it does as at least a few of them will think that this farrago bears some resemblance to reality - I wonder how they will respond in how they live their lives? Hardly peacefully!",negative
i loved this bond movie!,negative
A killer start to the new Bond franchise. Daniel Craig is bad-ass!,positive
"The last half hour was just painfully boring. I liked this, but mostly because it got me interested in Bond again. As a stand alone film, it's not exactly orgasmic. Loved the card games.",negative
"Craig has brought the brooding, the intensity, and the respect back to the Bond franchise. This was much needed after the damage inflicted by Die Another Day (which even Madonna couldn't save). Judi Dench steals her scenes as per usual.",positive
best bond movie since goldfinger,positive
I wasn't even into Bond movies until seeing this one. Now he's my role model. Daniel Craig portrays what all guys should aspire to be(aside from the dissociative disorder). Caterina Murino is my new ideal of what the perfect woman looks like. Such a shame she was killed off half way through the movie. Such a shame.,positive
"Bond, the brute instrument. Now here it is, the Bond with the attitude.",positive
"Without a doubt one of the greatest Bonds. Emotional resonance, superb action and a much more human lead, this film is destined for greatness, and it improves with every viewing.",positive
The best Bond film....ever.,positive
"A good, gritty film. And watching it on Blu-ray is a must!!",positive
"I am not a big fans of James Bond... but this James Bond gives a twist character than the previous Bond... this one is rage and nasty... overall story explain us why the usual James Bond have that character... ""DRY MARTINI!"" ""shaken or stirred, sir?"" ""DO I LOOK LIKE GIVE A DAMN!!!"" :D",positive
Ehdottomasti paras Bondi! seuraavaa odotellessa..,positive
"A well made Bond movie that harkens back to practical action and stunts. A very well developed story, the ever beautiful Eva Green, kick ass action, and great music makes this one of the best Bond films...ever. Oh yeah Daniel Craig kicks ass as Bond.",positive
"OK, so it was a bit fake, but still pretty cool",positive
No one can resist a Bond Movie,positive
Never saw it coming... one of the best Bond's ever.,positive
Daniel Craig has proven himself worthy in becoming Bond.,positive
"Best Bond film I have seen and I have seen them all. Daniel Craig truly was brilliant, was very sceptical before the movie came out, was a big fan of Pierce Brosnan.",positive
"best bond movie ever! he's got everything other than only sex and techs, and that's what made it cool.",positive
bästa bond på länge.,negative
the guy's a thug. finally.,positive
Only Bond film I've wanted to watch twice in a row.,positive
"Best Bond movie, almost the best Bond",positive
Daniel Craig is sooo scrummy :),positive
"I haven't seen many Bond-movies.. Too much escape sceens and explosions, but this movie was entertaining and you even could find story behind the action jackson. James was credible.",negative
Un James Bond plus humain!,positive
"Great action, but it never felt like a Bond movie until he said, ""Bond, James Bond"" at the end",negative
if this had been the first james Bond i would have loved them all because Daniel Craig kicked everyones arse starting with Sean Connery and Roger Moore reaching to Pierce Brosnan this guy gave them a lesson in being a SECRET AGENT in HER MAGESTY'S SERVICE,positive
"Connery has the suaveness and nostalgia, but Casino Royale and Craig kick some serious ass. As a total package, it's contending for the best Bond and I can't wait for more.",positive
it just worked in so many ways,positive
Amazing film. Definately one I can watch again and again. Daniel Craig has become very close to being the Bond of all Bonds with this performance.,positive
"What a fantastic suprise this one turned out to be. After the enjoyable but SO predictably run-of-the-mill 'Die Another Day' anyone expecting a tired rerun is in for a big suprise. From the stylish black and white intro and a fantastic credit sequence 'Casino Royale' delivers Bond in the way he was intended to be seen. Any naysayers unsure as to Daniel Craig's suitability for the role must be gorging themselves on humble pie by now, for he fits the role immaculately. Gone are the cheesy gadgets, one liners and OTT bad guys, replaced here by classy dialogue, gritty action and a tortue scene to make you wince. Lets hope they keep the quality up for Bond 22, on the strength of this Bond is back in a big way....",positive
Great up until the last half hour when James Bond grew a pussy.,negative
"Saw this on choir tour. It was pretty good, liked it ok. Yeah, 1 of my friends thought I couldn't handle the torture scene, guess they don't know I can handle all types of gore. Blood's cool!",negative
Watched this in Cinema and also on Blu Ray at Home - just fantastic.,positive
Great re-imagining of the series. No electro-suits or giant heat-lasers this time.,positive
I like this bond better than the rest. He's not afraid to do some physical scenes like the rest of these newer Bonds.,positive
"James Bond is dead! Long live James Bond! I absolutely hate the older Bond films but this one delivers. No stupid grinning Moore style but harsh action with a touch of charm here and there. At some parts it was still a bit too bondish for me but all in all this was by far the best, and the only watchable, Bond ever made!",positive
"Something different for a change, Yipee!!",negative
I thought this was brill. I love James Bond films and Daniel Craig was fantastic! Mmmm mmmm mmm,negative
"I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see it (which was by the way the first time I saw a James Bond in the theater rather than on tv) --- the critics so far hadn't been the best,so I was really curious. and what should I say:great movie!! saw it already at least 3 or 4 times :))",positive
why bond is bond. craig is perfect. this is the best bond movie since the sixties.,positive
"The best of Bond... powerfully acted and made, great supporting roles and a lesson well learnt!",positive
Really good Like The New Bond !! xx,negative
very good 1 of da best,positive
"Fantastic and just proves all those ""Blonde Bond"" doubters to be a bunch of idiots! I can watch this film over and over again!",positive
"Gotta be the best Bond film. Yeah, we all love Connery but Daniel Craig has the bollocks to make a great Bond. Thank Christ this franchise got back to its roots. Die Another Day was a stinking pile of crap that coulda sunk Bond for good. Let's hope this new Bond formula is adhered to for some time to come.",positive
now this is sad a the end but i like it i give it a 4 in a half :),negative
"for a brand new bond franchise, it has started of promising. this is why we will never see tarantino (who wanted to direct this) and his autueristic grubby little hands anywhere near this baby...",positive
The best Bond movie ever. DC proves that he has got all the ingredients to be the best 007 ever. No airy fairy crappy stuff. Itâs pumped with 24/7 nerve racking action and ass kicking attitude. Awesome,positive
"Bond reinvented. Wasn't keen on Daniel Craig at first but after seeing the film you couldn't imagine any other bond doing what he does. Imagine Roger Moore in this film. His hair would never fall out of place. Without Bond there would be no Bourne. Without Bourne, Bond would be a pussy.",positive
so much better than i thought it was going to be! really didn't like the idea of Danel Criag but loved him immediatly!,positive
"Best Bond since Connery? Damn right! Great action, brilliant script, but hats off to Craig for making Bond his own.",positive
"Bond got better. More real agent, less Mr. Invincable.",positive
"If Windows gets too old and bloated, you ""reboot"". Same here and goodness, how things feel so much better. Eva Green is the most beautiful ""Bond girl"" in I don't know how long. Definitely worthy of the book, despite the bow to current ""poker fad"" by excising chemin-de-fer.",positive
"Couldn't give a toss about Bond before, but this is brilliant. Explosive action, gritty, bold, brutal.",positive
another remake but what a way to bring bond back from the dead. an whats great is its the director who did it last time (director of golden eye),positive
The second ebst Bond movie ever.,positive
He's a great new Bond. One of the best Bond's in a while.,positive
"Kind of made me want to hit Daniel Craig in the nuts repeatedly. Very pretty film, but nobody has ever gone to see a Bond movie for the artistically-filmed action sequences.",negative
"el mejor james bond despues de Sean Connery, me encante esa escena en el carro, Â´ Â¨no eres mi tipoÂ¨,Â¨ porqeu soy inteleigenteÂ¨ no porque eres solteraÂ¨",positive
The best of James Bond.,positive
The best JB i've seen in my life,positive
I'm not sure how I feel about this. Bond with gritty violence and nasty bad guys seems like a cool idea - only I think it might be revelling in the violence whilst trying to pretend that violence is bad and damaging. The dead give away is that the tone of the rest of the film is kinda like the old bond movies - gadgets and stuff don't sit well with me transposed next to having your balls whacked with a piece of rope. Is the audience for this stuff really as brutalised post September 11th as this makes me feel?,negative
"I'm looking forward to more of this Craig/Bond. This movie wasn't great, but there's potential.",negative
"Entertaining for sure, a bit over the top but it is a Bond movie. Haven't noticed that much product placement in a while, good job Sony and Ford Motor Compnay. :-s",negative
"I don't care what Bond purists say: this is by far the best Bond movie ever. Daniel Craig gives us a Bond who's more about the job than the (insert Bond convention here), proving that Bond's true soul lies beyond the preparation of a Martini. Oh, but that Chris Cornell theme is worse than Madonna's",positive
"I was never a Bond fan until now, it takes the franchise to a different place and a better one at that.",positive
Awesome. This is what the franchise should have ALWAYS been doing with this story!,positive
"Really enjoyed the new bond, quite sexy. I enjoyed the chase scene in the beginning in the construction site. Wow the guy running from Bond was like a monkey climbing up girders, etc.",positive
"The only decent bond film, but whats up with the ford mondeo? The Urban Running was good",positive
"Pleasantly surprised. I'm not one of these die-hard Bond fans. But I've seen pretty much all of them; this is the best in years. Bone-crunching fight scenes, punch-you-in-the-face hilarious too... And it also introduced me to the perfectly formed, hugely talented Eva Green. Bond earns his stripes as he's portrayed as a human being; and not a cheesy action figure. Brilliant stuff.",positive
"if this weren't a James Bond movie, if they had given it another name then i would have liked it, but they really ruined it when they tried to make it something that it couldn't be.",negative
defiantly one of the better james bond movies,positive
"The best bond ever. The best action, the best suspense, and it explains so much for all the other movies.",positive
I was never a 007 fan until Daniel Craig took over the role...who knew a Blond Bond would be the best Bond of all.,positive
"I watched it on 4 different days, so I sometimes didn't know what happened exactly before, but I liked it!!",positive
The best Bond film since From Russia With Love. Way too long for it's own good but great none the less.,positive
Poss the best Bond film EVER and how fit is Daniel Craig??!!!,positive
Daniel Craig seriously IS THE BESTTTT BOND!,positive
"Even though I am a die hard Sean Connery fan, I have to admit that Daniel Craig is really an awesome 007. He just makes Bond seem cool!",positive
"A new look to Bond, and with it a new attitude. I enjoyed both. Piercing blue eyes, I think a little less suave but more believable. I did miss cool little gadgets from Q, but I liked the little deviations from the norm, in drink order for one.",positive
Excellent James Blond from Heswall. Stunningly good film. Anyone who doesn't like Bond should give this a try,positive
Although it wasn't a 'true' 007 movie it was still really good.,positive
The best Bond film yet!,positive
One of the best Bond movies of all time.,positive
Fucking boss. I can't wait for the next one,positive
"Daniel Craig redefines James Bond. Before I wouldn't be excited for a new Bond-flick, but Casino Royale left me wanting more. It's a genuinely good movie.",positive
I'm upset that she died.,positive
The first plausable Bond film and amazingly good,positive
Bond has come to life,positive
I found this kind of boring.,negative
another James Bond classic the story line is great and so is the cast need i say more,positive
Den fÃ¶rsta Bondfilm jag sett som jag faktiskt gillar! Riktigt bra pÃ¥ bio!,positive
"The press slated it and then I saw it and couldn't wait to see it again. Absolutely brilliant and we needed to see Bond in a slightly more serious way, I'd really like to be Bond, who wouldn't? This film was amazing and fantastic at the same time. Plus a record holder, for the most number of time a car has rolled.",positive
"Finally, the Bond I was waiting for. For me, the best Bond ever.",positive
Best Bond in a long time!,positive
the action is perfect....,positive
"..vÃ¤ittÃ¤vÃ¤t mitÃ¤ tahansa, paras Bond koskaan.",positive
Best Bond-movie I have ever seen. maybe itÂ´s the poker..? ;),positive
"superb movie!!! best-movie ever!! the chasing scene, the hand-to-hand combat, the womanizing, and the poker games is nicely directed. DANIEL CRAIG IS BOND!!!!!!",positive
"Wow, as bad if not worse than George Lazenby. A disaster from the very beginning! Bond is supposed to be impossibly good looking, soave, intellectual, well-dressed, european in style and among all of that not get his Canali too ruffled during bouts. Whatever happened with the naked woman silhouettes on opening credits. A huge faux pas, this has been synonymous with all 007's. The impossibly silly evasive fight stunts throughout were enough to make Superman look as delicate as a Nutcracker ballerina. Unless I'm completely blind, I also failed to spot any women that would make it beyond a 6 on a beauty scale. Bonds have traditionally always had a jaw-dropper or two or three!!! It's unfortunate that the pain with Craig must live on for his contractual Bond life. The one star is for the sake of rating by the way.",negative
"Sympa, Daniel Craig est crÃ©dible comme l'ensemble du film. Je regrette juste l'accent un peu working class de Daniel. La scÃ¨ne de torture testiculaire est par contre vraiment risible.",positive
The best Bond ever! Best film & best actor!,positive
Sean Connery is of course THE Bond. But Craig is surprisingly good. A 007 movie is a 007 movie. You get what you want. Action and ridiculous gadgets I love it.,negative
Not big fan of 007 movies but I really enjoyed this one.,positive
Best opening sequence I've ever seen. Craig is extremely sexy.,positive
This Bond has a rawness that the others just don't. Daniel Craig is physically up to the challenge and the potential for further collaborations has me excited!!,positive
"Not bad, but I prefer the previous 007!",negative
They missed the point. Hey! this is James Bond we're talking about. And what was it with this ending...gosh!,negative
Best Bond movie ever!,positive
Best james Bond movie,positive
"A new style in bond movies, more violent, more realistic.",negative
Never seen any other Bond films but this was really good. Has anyone read the book?,positive
Lost the James Bond touch... Brosnan will be missed.,negative
"My expectations for this were high. It met most, but the lovey-dovey section of the movie did not need to be that long to be effective.",negative
Liked it but the new bond is still not as good a Brosnan was,positive
return to Bond as I remember from all those years ago.,positive
The best Bond movie since the days of Connery!,positive
"A believable Bond. No quirky unrealistic gadgets, just a lot of decent action. And of course sexy ladies. A renewal of my faith in the series. No Halle Berry in this one (thank god).",positive
"Daniel Craig as Bond is just hot. He's my favorite Bond actor because he makes the most sense as a secret agent. He also makes Bond more human, therefore more believable.",positive
"What is the point of having this little man play James Bond when Sir Roger is still alive? Sir Roger could have despatched each baddie in this film simply by raising his eyebrow and issuing a cutting remark. No need to even get the safari suit dusty. However, with todays craving for mindless violence at the expense of verbal repartee, I suppose the next Bond will probably be Bruce Willis or Steven Seagal.",negative
the movie wasnt all that...it was the special time i had watchin it,negative
Enfin un vrai James Bond!!!,positive
"My favourite James Bond movie and one of the most intense action movies of 2006, Casino Royale is a great re-imagining of the legend of 007, thanks to a decent story, a good villain and Daniel Craig.",positive
"I originally wasn't going to watch this, but it more or less landed on my lap. It will be the last Bond film I bother with.",negative
"The best Bond, by far. I still have to see this one again.",positive
"not a big james bond (kiss kiss bang bang) fan, but this was one of the better one. At least this guy looks liek he can take someone out unlike the last bond who was a wimp",positive
I loved this film. i would give it 10 out of 5 stars if possible. a great start to the new wave of bond films. very very gritty. i dont care what anyone says daniel craig was a great 007.,positive
"I love the new james bond. i never liked the james bond movies before Daniel Craig but now that he is in them, ill start watchin.",positive
"Best one yet, but that's my opinon. Bond finally has flaws, truly shows some emotion, and the scene in the shower was gold. (not what you think, you cheeky monkey!)",negative
Very good Bond film. Probably the best one since Sean Connery depicted the character. The opening set piece (with Bond chasing someone over construction equipment) was amazing.,positive
great score/title track,positive
Now the whole world will know that you died scratching my balls,positive
"James Bond is supposed to be classy, not an asshole.",negative
"Not quite like the other Bonds, but decent, Craig does a great job of portraying agent 007!",negative
good film worth watching.,positive
"a gritty take on Bond, it's great to see the brilliant Daniel Craig depicting a non-smarmy and complex Bond, and a darn sexy one too :) Eva Green is his match too",positive
"007 gets the reboot treatment in the gritty, high octane film based on the book that started it all. Daniel Craig is splendid as the new Bond, providing him with an edge not seen since the days of Sean Connery. Eve Green is spot-on as the lovely British Treasury agent who wins Bond's heart. Judi Dench is solid as always as Bond's boss, M. From the opening free-running chase to the climax in a crumbling Venetian house, this movie never ceases to grab your attention. Definitely one of the best, if not THE best Bond film to date.",positive
"Thank goodness the Bourne films gave this series a kick in the right direction, especially in the action department. Still a little way to go but Craig's a great Bond - although I can't imagine his Bond having been a Royal Navy officer.",positive
"As a man, have to feel for Bond in this movie.....",positive
I am now a James Bond fan!,positive
One of the very best western action films of the millennium.,positive
me enkantO vivi el suspensO mas grande de mi vida la amO!,positive
Maybe the best Bond-movie ever made. Daniel Craig sure established his place in the 007 category,positive
Up to now my favourite James Bond was Sean Connery... Daniel Craig is full filling his role!,positive
Anledningen till varfÃ¶r jag helt plÃ¶tsligt bÃ¶rjat gilla Bondfilmer... :-),negative
one of the best Bonds. and one of the best Bond films.,positive
"I am all in, best Bond movie yet. I love Craig's tough assassin portrayal of the role",positive
"Very nice, I love the soundtrack...",positive
finally a bond movie which feels like one fan'freakin'tastic,positive
Best bond film in years,positive
"Bond revitalized! I questioned Daniel Craig at first, but now I am sorry. The man named it. No more James Bond:Superhero, back to secret agent status, not saving the world.",positive
"Awesome! I hated the last few bond movies but Daniel Craig as bond has given new life to this dying genre. Gritty, filled with action. There was times that I needed to remind myself it was a Bond movie because it was gritty kinda like the Bourne movies. You gotta see it!",positive
This is the best Bond movie since Dr. No.,positive
The name is Bond...James motherfuckin Bond.,positive
Daniel Craig is the best James Bond since Sean Connery,positive
"Aside from that dumb chase at the beginning, this movie was pretty solid, putting Bond in the right direction.",negative
"The name's Craig, Daniel Craig.",positive
"I am not a big fan of Bond movies but I like this Bond. Its a lot more realistic and serious. I dont like those comic or supermen Bonds. Now, i want to read the original novels.",positive
"I personally loved this Bond film. I don't see why people are giving Daniel Craig crap for his performance as James Bond, although he is no Pierce Brosnan. But he brings the toughness that James Bond has lacked since Sean Connery. Plus this is an awesome Poker movie. But still I would've loved to see Pierce Brosnan do thsi one.",positive
Was never really a fan of James Bond until this movie. Now I am. I'm a bandwagon Bond fan. oh well,positive
the worst movie in the history of mankind,negative
yÃ¼zdelerin hesaplandÄ±ÄÄ± sahne ile oyundan Ã§Ä±kÄ±Åtaki kaza sahnesi unutulabilir mi...,positive
To fans of the Bond movies this is as good as it gets. Daniel Craig is perfect as James Bond and carries himself with steely determination throughout the movie. If ever someone was meant to play a role then this is it. Martin Campbell once again delivers the same needed exposive pace as he had done before with Goldeneye. Role on Bond 22.,positive
"I think this Bond is the truest to Ian Flemming's vision, having read the original 13 novels, and yet still modern enough to be relevant to todays audineces. A few more films like this and Craig will beat out Connery as the best Bond.",positive
Rough-edged Bond with consequences to the violence. More like Ian Fleming's books than the previous movies.,negative
"My second bond movie, and watching Daniel Craig is a bonus. Had some great moments (the chase scene in the beginning) but overall there were some boring point. SPOILER: Bond and a girlfriend? I was so glad when that bitch died. Trust no one, Bond!",negative
"Honestly, I think Daniel Craig is the best James Bond since Sean Connery!! Really good movie especially because of the love story and the sad ending. I like all James Bond movies, but this one is especially great for women!",positive
The best JB in years.,positive
all h wants is to get in bed with a girl,positive
My one and only James Bond viewing. I likey the Daniel Craig.,negative
Daniel Craig really can pull the Bond image off. He is going to be one of the best!!! This was such a great return to the franchise!!!,positive
Absolutely fantastic. Any doubts about a 'Blonde Bond' are put to rest immediately. This movie really captured a younger more naive Bond who needed to learn some hard lessons. Many of his trademark personality traits are explained perfectly in this adaptation of Ian Flemmings Novel.,positive
He's not Pierce Brosnan. . .I'm going to need some convincing he can be Bond.,positive
Best James Bond since Connery. Even Goldeneye seems weak to me after this one.,positive
"Bond should be funny, or Bond should be dark. Connery nailed funny, and Craig nails dark. Mwah.",positive
Daniel Craig is a big +. Great action.,positive
"Daniel Craig, do I need to say more?",positive
By Far my favorite movie to date!,positive
My FAVORITE Bond film!! Daniel Craig did an amazing job.,positive
Ok for a Bond film. But is missing all the Bond clichÃ©s. Confusing to review.,negative
Craig is the best Bond since Connery.,positive
"Buy for the best bond movie , not that i have seen any but the ones that I have seen this is the best one. I love movies that do how it all begain I think its grate.",positive
Bond is Back and I love it,positive
Surprisingly good considering how horrid the last few Bond movies were getting. Daniel Craig is a different but nice new Bond.,positive
"Brilliantly directed, acted, everything! Just one fantastic movie!",positive
I enjoyed Daniel Craig's James Bond. Probably one of my favorite Bond films since the Sean Connery era.,positive
awesome movie perfet james bond!,positive
"Beste bond filmen so langt, fÃ¸rste reaksjonen va ikkje fullt so bra, menne ette ait par vende so e ditta blitt ain film eg digga:)",negative
craig is really good .. i dont why most ppl dont like this movie..,positive
Loved every minute of it.,positive
The best Bond flick in years. I miss the early ones that had a feeling of intrigue and not camp. This is moving back there.,positive
"Best Bond ever... I was skeptical....Sean Connery was my favorite, until Daniel Craig kicked so much ass!",positive
i just saw it its really great i just like it,positive
Best Bond movie ever! Daniel Craig is the perfect James Bond.Can't wait till the next one.,positive
Lots of action little story,negative
One of the best Bond flicks...and I've seen them all. Daniel Craig is in great shape but a gargoyle. I guess some find that sexy. Eva Green is gorgeous and plays the role well... more depth than most Bond women. I hope they are more true to the novels from this point onward. Moonraker was nothing like the book. Laser gun battle! I digress.,positive
"Best James Bong by a long shot, I'm praying there are many more to come.",positive
A great movie. Daniel craig re-invents the character. Definitely one of the best bond films.,positive
Love the revamp. Daniel Craig is really good as bond. They've done what they did with Batman. Can't wait for the next one.,positive
"Daniel Craig will you marry me?..... Best Bond for ages!! Hard AND sexy, fantastic action. The story gets a bit silly near the end but otherwise a very good bond movie",positive
Best bond film since goldeneye,positive
Daniel Craig lookin' good!,negative
"All Bond films are brilliant , this one was more brilliant than brilliant!!!!!",positive
"wow, i never thought they would've pulled it off, but they did.",positive
"A very solid action movie, especially the outstanding free-running scene. The plot is solid too, as is the (comic relief?) torture scene.",positive
I liked it. Different from the norm.,negative
"Excellent film as it stands, but doesn't fit in with the series. However, top marks for Daniel Craig and the overall feel of the film is fantastic!",positive
"A more hard-ass bond, better than the wimpy and old Pierce Brosnan who thinks he's all that and suave. And this Bond can seriously run.",positive
"By far the only Bond film which is closest to a reality. Well maybe except for the crazy free-running. Another remarkable mention for this movie is the intertwining of its simple and not-Earth's-domination storyline, the absence of Q's gadgets, an actual relationship and the dark human side of a Bond.",positive
"Wildly anachronistic for a ""first mission"", but Craig just might be the most interesting Bond yet.",negative
Daniel Craig is the best Bond after Connery. No Question!,positive
"About as close to perfect as a movie can get. Beautiful locations, fantastic stunts and Daniel Craig who just oozes sex appeal. Best Bond yet, in my opinion.",positive
"Decent bond film, cruel and thrilling. Descends into boredom at the end with a ridiculous love story and starts with a very iffy set peice but overall entertaining.",negative
Was hoping Clive Owen would be the next Bond... but Daniel Craig far exceeded expectations!,negative
Superb and to say i was sceptical about Daniel Craig being Bond i think he has raised the bar on all the others....Top Film,positive
"Absolutely kick ass movie. Craig is perhaps the best Bond since Connery. This movie revamps the 007 series, much like what Batman Begins did with the Batman series. We see how Bond really becomes Bond. This gives hope of good things to come for 007 in the upcoming years.",positive
C'est même pas un vrai james bound!,negative
"I LOVE this movie. This is the only Bond film I've ever seen and I don't think any other could top it. Daniel Craig is bad ass as James Bond, not to mention extremely hot in every scene he's in. This film has a lot (action, story, etc.) and the time shows, but it's a film that keeps you in that moment till the very end. Bond is back!",positive
Sa fantastisk var den inte.,negative
easily the best bond movie,positive
not as good as i expected.,positive
Eh. Maybe I'm just not a James Bond person.,negative
"The best Bond movie to date. Daniel Craig silences all his critics with a brilliant performance. This grittier, tougher Bond is much more reminiscent of the character that Ian Fleming created. Clever lines, great action and special effects, and lets not forget Daniel Craig and his deliciousness...I even bought this movie for my psp! ""Shaken or stirred, Sir?"" ""Do I look like I give a damn?""",positive
le seul james bond que jai vu lol,positive
"Pretty darn good Bond movie. After reviewing, I decided to bump my score a bit because it might actually be the best Bond movie. The length is easily forgiving in the name of the complexity of the love story, which is what makes this spy thriller as wonderfully iconic as it is.",negative
...wif d new bond...he's soo 'kheng'...,positive
way better than pierce brosnan or timothy dalton's 007,negative
"This ranks up there with one of the best Bond films of all time. To truly appreciate this film, one must understand the history behind it and have watched the previous films. Daniel Craig should also be given huge credit for making this film such a hit. To this point, Craig is hands down the best actor to step into Bond's shoes. Only time will tell if he's the best ""Bond"" but it's clear that he is the best ""actor"" to play Bond. He has tremendous skills as an actor and it shows in his role as Bond. Craig-praising aside, this film is fantastic. The writing is crisp, witty, and tight. Scenes are compact, stakes are always high, and the action sequences are intense. Watching this movie, it is clear to see that every choice and moment in the film has a purpose and was done for a reason. From the unique B&W intro, to the cheeky ending announcing the Bond that audiences are familiar with, this film is filled with style. The acting is top notch, and the focus is always where it should be at any given time. Throw in one of the most beautiful Bond girls, and you have a legendary Bond film which is quite appropriate considering it's the first Bond story written by Ian Fleming. If I have a complaint about the film it's the choice to change the card game to Texas Holdem from the original choice. In the end, I was ok with it, since the film is reinventing Bond as well as bringing him closer to our generation.",positive
"Daniel Craig is a pretty pretty man, but he is blond and falls in love. Bad, bad man!",negative
"sans doute le meilleur bond de tout les temps,le seul ke je pourrais revoir plus de 2 fois.",positive
My Favorite Bond Movie by far,positive
Best James Bond ever.,positive
"If we forgive the James Bond license, this movie can be an basic action movie. But the fact it is supposed to be a James Bond make it an anachronism. A lot of little (and some big) mistakes made it the second worst James Bond (George Lazenbi and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" still being the worse).",negative
"I think that someone better than Daniel Craig could have been found. The least they could have done as at least mention Q Branch. Overall, not the best Bond film, but entertaining none the less.",negative
Best bond movie of the last two decades. Daniel Craig is my hero,positive
"About time that Bond reinvented itself. Finally Bond has aspired to reach the benchmarks Jason Bourne has set. Gone are the plain silly gadgets, poor action sequences and light humoured moments to be replaced with a sense of gritty realism and darkness that has evaded the series for so long. The new Bond has a familiarity with the Fleming character from the novels. Ruthless.",positive
"Effing Fantastic... Although i liked the last bond, this one seems like less of a pretty boy. He had some pretty painful moments but he took em like a man...and the action...Effing fantastic",positive
"It was fantastic, the best Bond film I've seen in a LONG time! Daniel Craig was a really nice surprise! Bodes well for the future of the Bond franchise",positive
I watch it. It's not the best bond film I've seen but its good to watch.,negative
Second worse Bond film ever! Craig is great but Green is miscast. Opening action sequence is only highlight. After this and Die Another Day I hope the Bond makes don't screw up this series!,negative
The opening and ending make up for a very long middle.,negative
MedelmÃ¥ttig bond film,negative
One of the best james bond films ever.,positive
"By far the best Bond movie ever, now I'm married to a Bond buff, I have to sit through them all now, and if they're anything like this, I could be converted!",positive
"Un James Bond un peu plus humain, de l'action et enfin un James Bond crédible depuis Sean Connery... On a failli attendre...",negative
best bond since sean connery!,positive
"This movie is watchable, good for a Friday evening after a hard week at work and you don't want to think too hard. I really did not like the idea of Daniel Craig as Bond, he looks like he would be more at home playing an East End (of London) villain than James Bond but I was pleasantly surprised. Many other reviewers have comments about different and more believable this Bond is but it is clear to me that the Bond producers were changing Bond to complete with the Bourne franchise. Finally this movie has many many plot issues which made me wonder if anyone read the script before they started shooting.",negative
Totally hot... totally sexy... totally awesome adaptation of the story... and I actually loved Daniel Craig as James Bond. So excited for future Bond movies.,positive
"James Bond is back with a vengeance. Finally, a 007 with some balls.",positive
best bond since connery,positive
The best bond even after one film,positive
Best Bond since Connery.,positive
OMG...this is what I've been waiting for!!! : ),positive
"The worst -ever- Bond movie. When you just dispose of the recepee of any other Bond movie (Gun barrel, Q, Moneypenny ?), you'll finally get a basic film without any great action sequence and just too much useless dialogues. Honestly is this realy a Bond movie ?",negative
Best Bond and Bond-movie ever. Gorgeous Craig.,positive
Bond is blond! This is the best Bond-film ever,positive
"Best Bond Movie! Daniel Craig is totally hot, dialogue is important (versus throw away quips) and the action scenes look like they actually hurt.",positive
Daniel Craig is much better than Brosnan.,negative
"good stunts, good humour in it as well. I did cringe when that gorgeous Aston Martin car crashed but Daniel Craig walking out of the sea made up for it. I must admit having been a fan of Pierce Brosnan as Bond I was a bit reluctant to see this one but really glad I did, Daniel makes an excellent Bond.",positive
my introduction to Bond. Brilliant!,positive
"I love Bond movies and this is one of the best! I was skeptical of Craig at first, but he fit the role great.",positive
"A brilliant upgrade to James Bond. A tougher, more ruthless character more in keeping with what I recall from the Fleming novels. I loved how they played with Bond conventions. He arrives in a Ford â travesty! Then leaves in an Aston Martin. His gun is big think with a silencer. And the woman's name and character seem unlike the traditional Bond girl. They didn't even have any dancing naked women in the opening credits. I think I even saw a Mandelbrot set in there. Even reflections on his character and the effect of his work on his soul.",positive
"this is my favourite james bond movie ever, to me its even better than Dr No and Goldeneye. I think part of this movies brilliance is due to the appauling end of Pierce Brosnans bond career, which became more of a science fiction movie than a bond film with invisable cars and alike. and so the decision to take bond back to his roots is a genius one. the casting of Daniel Craig is brilliant, i must admit i was sceptical as to whether he had the ability to fill the role of bond and im very happy to say he does with apparent ease. Eva Green is another beautiful and excellent addition to the cast and plays a brillant part as Vespa. a brilliant film and im looking forward to Daniel Craigs second outing.",positive
what a debut bond performance by daniel craig. a breath of fresh air. very handy film,positive
"This was a breath of fresh air from the recent, mediocre, Bond films. Although the car chase could have been better. But Daniel Craig is an awesome Bond and makes the movie well worth watching.",positive
I heart this movie james bond does it again though its a new one oh well good movie,positive
"Dark and moody, Bond is back. A bit slow in the middle, but Daniel Craig is a great new Bond",positive
Love it - especially the sceen where the bartender askes Bond if he wants his martini shaken or stirred and Bond replies - Do I look like I care. Beautiful!,positive
"Was never a Brosnan fan, so was glad to see a change of Bond. Great action, a few good one-liners but was a bit weak towards the end...",positive
"By far the best recent Bond film. On the negative side, several of the chase scenes were too long, elements of the plot were overwrought and there were disappointingly few cool 'Bond gadgets'. Overall though, the film was entertaining and surprisingly compelling.",positive
"Didn't feel like a Bond movie, almost too slick and fancy. Daniel Craig does a good job as Bond.",negative
"presque trop daction lol mais cest le style james bond, sinon le tout est ...bien ^^",negative
Smooth... Daniel Craig just works in this role.,positive
"Awesome, great film, adds to the backstory of the Bond films in a truely memorable way!",positive
"Finally, a modern Bond that doesn't suck. A blonde Bond works out just fine.",positive
"""Casino Royale"" represents a fundamental shift in the James Bond series. After the mediocrity of ""Die Another Day"" (2002) the producers of this film decided that the series needed an overhaul. I've enjoyed other Bond films, and I liked Pierce Brosnan's portrayal of Bond, but after ""Die Another Day"" I welcome the changes to the series. Daniel Craig is the new James Bond. He still injects some of the conventional Bond humor into the role, but overall plays him with a harder edge. Craig gives a solid performance and successfully reinvents the character. The film tends to linger a little too long on Craig's shirtless body at points, but that's a minor complaint. Eva Green plays Bond's female companion Vesper Lynd. She creates an interesting, sassy and intelligent character. I only wish she would take off some of that eye makeup. Admittedly I was always ambivalent about Judi Dench's semi-antagonistic style as M, but she gets better as the film progresses. Unfortunately Mads Mikkelsen is not compelling as Bond's rival Le Chiffre. His acting is fine, but the character never amounts to more than a generic villain. At first I was disconcerted by the fact that this film blatantly contradicts the timeline established by other Bond films, but I accepted that this film has a new timeline for a new Bond. Many of the conventions of Bond films are missing: there is no Moneypenny, no special gadgets and no cars with missiles. While these elements were effective in Bond films of the past, I didn't miss them here. There are still plenty of action sequences, and they were well-done even if the first one is overlong. The film's poker scenes were staged with enough tension that they didn't become boring. A welcome change in this film is that the plot is more rigorous. The series' answer to the tedious story of ""Die Another Day"" is more ambiguity and plot twists than the usual Bond fare. There have been more interesting Bond stories, but it's a good answer none the less, and I look forward to seeing future installments in this new Bond timeline.",positive
"What Spy movies are supposed to be like! The masculine, suave, handsome James bond acted by Daniel Craig puts on a wonderful performance.The heavenly Eva Green also puts on a wonderful performance with style and elegance. Overall this is a must see movie for any Action/ Spy fan.",positive
A little long but a good James Bond movie. Not as cheesy as some of the others.,negative
"i hated this movie, i usually like james bond",negative
"this was hothothot. the best bond for me actually. i loved eva green. can i please talk like that? i skipped the 'interogation' scene can't handle that! this was a fun, hot movie!",negative
Probably the best Bond movie. So many amazing action scenes and featuring characters that actually develop and an involving story. The opening sequence alone worth the price of the DVD.,positive
Best bond sense Goldeneye,positive
"as Bond movies go, this is the least typical of the lot",negative
Don't watch the start if you are scared of heights,negative
"I hate James Bond as a whole, but I really liked this one... it's like James Bond had a soul at some point...",positive
"I still haven't decided just how to review this yet. The scenes and plot remain disjointed -- almost as if South Park's ""Family Guy Manatees"" were pushing scene balls into a tank. That Eva Green was hot as shit, though.",negative
I kinda like the new Bond...,negative
"After Sean Conery, the best and real Bond.",positive
worst James Bond movie,negative
different take on the 007 but awesome nonetheless.,positive
"Have never seen the original, but this remake is excellent full of action, keeps you hooked throughout",positive
good movie!! not a normal bond.,positive
"Best Bond movie made to this date. Graig is awesome, also the pursuit scene at the beginning is one of the coolest I've seen.",positive
"An honest departure from his predecessors. Not quite the frenetic, paranoid Jason Bourne type, but more down to earth, aka human, than he's known for. A little vulnerable, and cynical, and beaten is nice.",negative
Typical action adventure. Nice action scenes but is ultiamtely very forgettable,negative
"Finally Bond is really back. None of that smirking, catchphrase tossing, gadget ""spy"" crap. This Bond is the real thing. Mean, arrogant, and deadly.",positive
Best Bond flick since Connery ... and I'd originally thought that Brosnan in Goldeneye was as close to perfect as they could get it. So happy to be proven wrong!,positive
"Quitando al maravilloso Sean Conery, este es el Bond que mÃ¡s me ha gustado. Y, lo siento, pero estÃ¡ para hacerle un favorÂ¡Â¡Â¡Â¡",negative
"This latest James Bond movie is a departure from previous instalments in the franchise. It starts off with an interesting action sequence then, inexplicably, slows down to a crawl without much meaningful plot development. The bad guys in Casino Royale are a bit of a disappointment, too. Unlike the satirical, cartoonish evil-doers of yore, the ones who populate Casino Royale are a little dull, never quite managing to instil feelings of fear, dread and loathing in viewers. Perhaps the bad guys are in a state of transition, moving from cartoonish to menacing, and the producers haven't yet found a way to convincingly realize that vision. Judi Dench (as M) is in fine form, but a little less haughty and regal than usual. All is not lost; the action does heat up with some thrilling and fairly believable sequences. The movie ends in a classically Bond way but with a huge and surprising twist. What really pulls viewers in is Daniel Craig, who plays the part of James Bond. More than just a 'blond Bond', he's more sinewy, visceral and intelligent than his predecessors, who usually got by with lots of connivance and sleight-of-hand. Indeed, here is a new and improved Bond - one who also has real feelings and foibles. Sure, he's still debonair, accomplished and confident, but not in the cliched way of previous inhabitants of the Bond role. Imagine that - an honest-to-goodness living, breathing James Bond. With better plot and character development, Craig could go far with the 007 franchise - if he chooses to accept the mission.",negative
"By far, the best James Bond I've seen. Sorry, Sean connery.",positive
love it! think it one of the best james bond movies yet,negative
"El mejor James Bond de todos los tiempos (Lo siento, Sean Connery)",positive
Best bond in a while,positive
"Never been a Bond fan, but I loved this Bond flick. Daniel Craig makes for a real kick ass bond. And all without silly gadgets!",positive
Bond reinvented !! The best bond film since Goldfinger.,positive
best bond movie ever made,positive
A welcome return to the Bond genre after some very poor recent offerings.,positive
"blah blah, gritty, blah blah, back to basics, blah blah re-inventionblah blah, regurgitating all the hypeblah blah,",negative
"Lot of action,a little bit from everyting and the bond carisma",negative
"A good Bond entry, not the best though. Craig Daniel dons the suit wonderfully, but what's all this restarting nonsense! Stop it! Shame this film was overly confusing and when did they lose the plot? Middle? The end? It lacked a proper finale, but the rest of the film was cool.",positive
"Probably not fair for me to comment, because i realize now I'm just not into James Bond films, but the only thing I liked about the last ones were Pierce Brosnan. Daniel Craig is more like Die Hard meets Bond, which doesn't work for me.",negative
Paras bond elokuva ja samalla yksi parhaista elokuvista!,positive
"They bring it back to basics (and, more importantly back to the books) and what do you get? The best bond film since Goldfinger... maybe even better..",positive
Probably the best bond film.,positive
one of the best Bond's... after Goldfinger.,positive
What can I say - Daniel Craig although my favourite bond is still Pierce Brosnon..,positive
My favorite Bond so far. It is story driven instead of stunts driven.,positive
"A great movie with an overwrought script. I can't be the only one who winces at ""If there was nothing left of you but your smile and your little finger, you'd still be the greatest man I've ever met.""",positive
"I'm a huge Bond film, despite all the flack the new Bond got for being blond, this movie knocked it out of the park.",positive
"Bond lives for a new generation and now he really, really kicks arse. Brilliant rejuvenation of a classic franchise. Style with the right dose of substance. Bravo",positive
Okay I have never...and I mean NEVER liked any 007 movied. But this one was GREAT! Enough said.,positive
Not bad but a bit too long... The last shot in Venice is too much.,negative
"a fantastic, gritty, tense 007. although i do hold a special place in my heart for the campy earlier films, this is the bond that i've always wanted.",positive
"Favorite bond movie, Daniel blew me away at how good of a Bond he makes, great film.",positive
The best 007 movie yet to come!!!,positive
"it seems ""old skool james bond"" tried to make a comeback, this is not just another blow-em-up action movie like the series started to become",positive
"A refreshingly gritty take on Bond after the excessive spy-fi glitz of the Brosnan years. Many of the most tired Bond clichÃ©s are deconstructed and effectively rebooted. Hard, brutal, down-to-earth and perfectly executed by Craig who proves all his critics horribly horribly wrong. Matter over mind - possibly the epitome of mid-00's action film aesthetics. Incredible - can't wait for the next one.",positive
Now I just have to find my copy.... but yeah it was awesome.,positive
"I haven't really liked previous Bond films, but this one is great.",positive
the best james bond movie ever,positive
"No More Good Looking , No charm and humour for Bond. little romance, just violence. anyway good movie",negative
"It's like the world series of poker, but without the witty dialog. *MAT",negative
Put a new twist on the James Bond series that was really entertaining with a great opening of free running,positive
"I was bit sceptical about Daniel Craig as the new Bond but any doubt was cast away after 5 mins of watching the start sequence... Back to basics and more Bourne Identity-esque, not so over the top. Taking it back to its roots ironically makes it feel newer and fresher! Good!",positive
"This is by far the best Bond movie of the series.Daniel Craig delivers a tough, visceral, no guts no glory James Bond which is just what the series needed.",positive
love the card scene and daniel craig is a good bond,negative
"From the moment this movie started, I was enthralled. Daniel Craig brings the brauns back Bond. And it was about time.",positive
The best bond ever...,positive
This movie made me go back to the gym.,positive
"After seeing it, it's the *only* good Bond movie. But why not watch the Bourne movies instead?",positive
Not your typical Bond film but I liked it.,positive
"Nice reboot for series,",positive
go saee this movie to see for your selves best bond ever,positive
Interesting repositioning of the Bond franchise. Well shot and well acted.,negative
Probably one of the top three or four Bonds. Daniel Craig and Eva Green radiate the kind of onscreen charisma I associate with movie stars of the '40s and '50s.,positive
One of the best James Bond films of all time. Daniel Craig makes a great Bond and is a very good story.,positive
"Nice. The first Bond movie I've actually really liked... and the first Bond since Connery who actually mattered. It's so nice that they're finally approaching Bond as what he is... a cold, calculating, killer spy. It's about fucking time. I'd gotten so tired of the kitschy Moore BS -- Dalton and Brosnon ... ugh, really? Finally, we get a great representative of the spy and a fantastic story. Perhaps a little too much reliance on Deus Ex Machina but *shrug*, what can you do, right? And the accents are a bit thick at times, but that's just me being a whiny American... overall, excellent action film and a brilliant remaking of the Bond mythos.",positive
"I REALLY don't like Bond movies, but I REALLY liked this film!",positive
a smouldering reinvention of the bond movies - underpinned by a seriously credible new lead.,positive
"James Bond new style! No Moneypenny, few gadgets but lots of fun! go watch!",positive
The best James Bond movie to come out this decade,positive
"Kan Bond vaere blond? Ikkje i mine auge, ellers er Bond som alltid underholdande, sjoelv om pokeren her er latterlig",negative
Daniel Craig's butt put in an extraordinary performance.,positive
I'll just say mmmmmmmm.......,positive
"The best Bond has ever been. The deconstructionist chases, the (ahem) realistic re-invention of gadgetry... It's more than a good Bond film, it's a good film and a valid artistic statement in it's own right.",positive
"from allmovie: Any questions about Daniel Craig's worthiness are thrown out almost immediately as we are handed a film filled to the brim with exquisite action and explosive emotion. I squirmed in my seat with delight as I have not done since I was a child. What ""Batman Begins"" did for that franchise, ""Casino Royale"" does, and more, for Bond. For a while it seemed that he might not be able to well exist outside the confines of the cold war, but here we are given an entirely modern Bond with enough nods to the original that we can't be too upset. Maybe it's because this is the last novel yet to be filmed in the traditional Bond manner and it is Ian Fleming who has stolen our hearts not this incarnation of the super spy. However I like to think that someone actually just got their act together and concentrated on the film itself as opposed to who they could get the most product placement money out of. Congratulations. James Bond will live on for at least one more generation, and maybe forever. Great set pieces and one of the best chase sequences not involving cars ever put on screen, blended with beautiful locations and even more lovely women add up to the perfect cocktail with the twisting story line acting as the lemon peel in the martini, holding it all together. Many will come out saying that this is the best Bond film ever and I can not rightly say they are wrong at this point. Only time will tell that tale. However every fan can be assured that this ranks amongst the very upper crust of Bond movies, and Craig is no Lazenby. He lends a harsh wit and a thuggish charm to the character and by the end he's no longer the new guy, he is Bond, James Bond. A masterpiece of popular film-making and the movie we have been waiting for all year. See it early and often as it is sure not to diminish upon reviewing.",positive
Absolutely great film!,positive
A brilliant Bond movie with a brilliant Bond! One of my favourite films.,positive
one of the best bond movies ever,positive
"The best Bond movie. Brutal, far more believable than most recent spy movies. The love story element goes on about 20 minutes too long. And the movie loses something on multiple viewings. Still a keeper, though.",negative

One of the best Bond movies I have seen - very good acting and stunts.,positive

"The best bond film for decades! the action sequences were edgy and exciting, and i enjoyed the chemistry between Daniel and Eva.Pure genius.",positive
"Not too bad, but not in true Bond format. If it wasn't a Bond movie then in would be good but disappointing as a Bond movie.",negative
better than expected.,positive
"Not normally that keen on the bond films, but this is cleary the best by far.",positive
"My favorite Bond is Roger Moore. I like gadgets and humorous action. But Daniel is not too serious, he is a lot better than Timothy Dalton. The running sequence at the beginning is great, otherwise pretty standard action movie.",negative
"Best Bond movie ever, together with GoldenEye and Goldfinger.",positive
"Easily the best Bond movie ever. And not just a great Bond movie but a great MOVIE. Love, loss defrost the icy Bond heart. Awesome.",positive

Didnt reallt think much of this movie,negative
"Best Bond for ages, but I still prefer Sean and Roger. Am ready to change my opinion if DG keeps up with his work",positive
"Another awesome bond film. Doesn't rely on the cheesy gadgets, overexaggerated action scenes and flocks of hot women to sell the movie, as it has in the past. Craig was good as Bond, he pulled off the action scenes very well, however he could inject some of the famous wit every now and again. Eva Green pulled off a very good english accent and played a great character both beautiful and intelligent. Loved how they also left room open for the sequel",positive
I've seen this film several times now and it is by far the best Bond film i have ever seen. Granted all the rest are utter shit but this film really is worth praise as an individual set aside from the rest of the franchise.,positive
"First time I saw this movie was at 2 in the fucking morning. Besides the fact that I wasn't interested in this movie at all, this didn't help.",negative
"Brings classic Bond and theater bond to a very, very nice middle ground. I cant wait to see where Craig takes the series. The card game was a little drawn out, but this one was just an all round good Bond film.",positive
"Personally one of my favorite Bond movies. I know Daniel Craig is blond but he pulls the, ""I'm smarmy and can kick your ass at the same time"" look off so well",positive
"I was never a Bond fan, but really enjoyed this movie. The Parkour chase scene in the beginning was new and exciting. The violence was real and convincing, and the movie spaed us all the special effects that we are used to. Story was good too.",positive
"Daniel Craig is the best, and hottest Bond since the days of 'yore with Mr. Connery...this is an excellent Bond movie full of action and suspense without all the silly gadgetry from the older movies and badly overdone computerized special effects of the last few Brosnan movies. Really excellent film. And I hadn't seen any original Bond films before I saw this movie and I loved it.",positive

A Bond film that is actually a good film.,negative
I dont like Bond movies but this one... the best ever...saw this at the movies and WOW!,positive
"Best Bond since Connery, maybe even better. Strips away all the gadgets and cliches and has just a bit of darkness that makes this Bond a much more formidable spy.",positive
"By far, BY FAR the best Bond film - relying on the acting talent rather than the gadgets and stupid not-so-witty double entendres/asides. Talk about show the critics what for - well done Mr.Craig!",positive
"Despite not wanting to see it, I will admit it was good",positive
Only Bond movie I've ever enjoyed.,positive

Probably the best Bond movie ever I've seen. Daniel Craig was unbelievably good :) the movie is a blast totally!!,positive
Perfect replacement for Brosnan.,positive
Best Bond ever! I never thought anyone could beat Sean Connery. I was wrong.,positive
brings james bond into the 21st century,positive
"Now, if all of JB was this good.",positive
"Bond films are usually good for classic 'man's man' action, car chases, techno-gadgets, and campy villians. This new Bond is *much* more realistic but that's not exactly why I normally like these films. OK, that said, it had some HUGE plot holes, a card game (poker not baccarat) that took up most of the movie, and, with two exceptions (building chase at the beginning, and the conclusion sequence) was lacking in 'action'. It'll be interestingto see where the franchise goes from here.",negative
"In short--great action, no story.",negative
BÃ¤sta bond pÃ¥ mycket lÃ¤nge.,positive
Looks good on bluray. Not my fav bond actor,negative
"Likely the best Bond flick, due to the fact that 007 now seems completely human and is not portrayed as a superhero. Craig plays a much darker Bond, and brings some credibility back to an excellent series.",positive
"I took off half a star because of the pacing towards the end, but definitely one of the best Bond movies.",positive
yes..it done it for me. definitely kept with the classic bond genre,positive
Saved the entire series. Exactly what was needed.,positive
Thank you Daniel for helping me put Sean & Pierce in the past.,positive
"Love Bond films, but this one was more than just action and cheesy lines-- I enjoyed getting to see Bond before he became so detached.",positive
Thought this was actually quite good,negative
"Top notch Bond. Best he's been in years. A few pacing issues throw things off a bit, but for the most part this series reboot is right on the money.",positive
I like the james bond saga.. I watched it in a flight between lima and sao paulo...,negative
Martin Campbell is a genius,positive
Much better than I expected. Very good movie.,positive
Probably the best Bond film yet.,positive
"i had faith in daniel craig from day one. this movie surpassed all of my expectations, and they were high to begin with. fuck bourne. bond is here to stay.",positive
Daniel Craig doesn't do it for me.,negative
"Fantastic. Daniel Craig announces his arrival as a major player in this entry. More serious, more violent, but still prone to goofy one-liners and kinky sex, his Bond is top-notch. I also thoroughly enjoyed the focus on the card games. Great stuff. The exotic locales and unique villains certainly don't hurt either.",positive
James Bond Has Done it again!,positive
Best James Bond Movie ever,positive
"Probably the best Bond movie. Very authentic to Fleming's vision of the character. Brutal fights and sardonic, biting dialogue. Craig is a good mix of all the Bond's traits. A smartass and a badass. Bond is back for the 21st century.",positive
Honestly I think this is the best Bond film.,positive
Best Bond since Connery.,positive
Pretty good Bond...but I like Pierce better and I liked Goldeneye.,positive
Love action - Love Mads Mikkelsen! Go Denmark!,positive
"luv it sooo much, heee's silly!! lol",positive
"First scene was amusing, first half of film was alright, second half of film was not so, and last half hour made me throw up. First Bond I ever saw btw. ;o)",negative
"Great Film, Did exactly what needed to be done (and more) to bring back life into such a well known franchise.",positive
"Terrible, fatal, le alargaron el final como 3 veces... no le llega ni a los talones a SÃ³lo se vive dos veces, o a Vive y deja morir.",negative
"Daniel Craig dons the mantle of 007, in the grittiest and most faithful character interpretation since Dalton's Living Daylights, and Connery's From Russia With Love. Craig is more than competent in the role, he IS the role.",positive
"was very impressed with Craig`s performance, wasnt too sure before, but he was very well casted, cant wait to see more of him.",positive
Daniel Craig is the perfect Bond.,positive
"Casino Royale is Bond reinvented. The franchise needed a modern injection following such recent films as Mission Impossible III and the exceptional Bourne series. I was initially hesitant about Daniel Craig as Bond but purely for aesthetic reasons: for one, surely Bond shouldn't be strolling out of the ocean looking like The Hulk. He also perhaps shouldn't be blonde. But all is instantly forgiven and forgotten when Craig acts; he is without doubt the most accomplished performer to play the iconic role since Connery. He brings sincerity, coolness and a quiet stillness. I miss the ham and cheese of Roger Moore a little but this is an extremely solemn Bond picture. A riveting storyline, quality action sequences and some surprisingly poignant dramatic scenes make this a welcome return for 007.",positive
"His body,need i write anymore?",positive
it wasnt as good as the older ones but it was good,negative
Only bond film i've ever seen from start to finish! Loved it and its got venice in it!,positive
The best Bond movie since Sean Connery!,positive
daniel craigs hotness!!!! nuff said!,positive
"At first I was doubtful of Daniel Craig being Bond, but this film definitely proved he can do it. I loved the contained plot that didn't take place all over the world and in outer space like previous Bond films (Moonraker, The world is not enough, BLEH!)",positive
Hilarious! I could not stop laughing!,negative
"Hands down the best of the Bond films. And Craig is the best Bond yet. Terrific, thoughtful entertainment (if a tad long).",positive
"best bond in the franchise, some like it some dont, i love it, its alll good",positive
"I am a bond movie lover, and this one surprised me with how good it was",positive
The best James Bond movie ever.,positive
beste bond ever:) iallefall siden Sean connery himself..,positive
Daniel Craig is definitely hot!,negative
I liked this much edgier uncertain brash and in your face Bond to the others,positive
"The only Bond film I actually enjoyed. I'm not a big fan of Daniel Craig, but I have to admit he looks great naked. Also, I still think Clive Owen would make a great 007.",negative
"I'm probably the only one who loved this movie. But I'm SO OVER the whole ""is-it-Bond-material""-discussion!",positive
What a looker. And he falls in love finally. I watch this over and over especially the part where Daniel Craig steps out of the sea..And the sailing. Say no more. SOLD; SOLD; SOLD! Best Bond ever.,positive
"En hyfsad actionfilm som påstår sig vara en bondfilm, vilket är felaktigt.",negative
Great comeback for the 007 series.,positive
Different. But good different:),positive
The best bond movie. OMG. AMERICA NEEDED THIS,positive
Daniel Craig is one of the best James Bond ever!!!,positive
More of a movie than a Bond movie; the action is second-to-none but the old Connery charm is still lost.,negative
"Grym action film. En av de bÃ¤sta bond filmerna. Daniel Craig har humor, charm och Ã¤r tuff jÃ¤kel. En riktig bond alltsÃ¥...",positive
cool.. bond strikes again,positive
"He's a GREAT Bond, but that script, what the hell was happening at the end? Okay, he's in love, WE GET IT. Such utter overkill. If they cut out the last 45 minutes of the movie it would have been a gem.",negative
The 4th Greatest film i've ever seen. Jumps at you right from the start and doesn't dissapoint until the end. Best bond film i've seen since goldeneye,positive
At last a bond how i see as a bond! Connrey and Moore are good but thank you Craig for taken the roll!,positive
The most realistic Bond ever!,negative
Wasn't super amazing but it was very interesting seeing the Secret Agent moving up and becoming a double-O agent. Not really any amazing gadgets and stuff. Pretty good movie. Kind of kept continuing on when you thought it was going to end though lol.,positive
"I love this film, but truly, its about ten to fifteen minutes too long. It drags particularly near the end, and while my opinion may change in the future, it is not as rewatchable as the Brosnan and Moore pictures. Still, Daniel Craig is amazing as Bond.",positive
Best Bond film...it will be interesting to see the next Craig film.,positive
I like this one.bexause it's simple and make us rediscover the attractive things.This is a balanced movie between physical action and pshycologilal direct.,positive
"um, ladies? this will be your new ""go to"" movie, i promise~",positive
Daniel Graig is best Bond ever! :),positive
i love all bond movies and this one was just as good if not better than the other ones.,positive
Wasn't expecting to love this film. Daniel Craig wins hands down for being best Bond and Casino Royale proves to be in a league of its own. Refreshing!,positive
"fast paced, catchy and definitely keeps you rooted to the screen as you excitedly await what's coming up. plus a superb potrayal of james bond!",positive
"I finally watched the new Casino Royale last week. It was faithful to the source but seemed a little long and somehow in a Jason Bourne world, Bond seems more of a dinosaur than ever.",negative
This bond movie is a bit more realistic than others. There is emphasis on Bond's character rather than his fancy gadgets. He is not the emotionless killing machine but a sensitive spy. Definitely my favorite bond movie.,positive
"I love James Bond books, which means that most of the films are a consistent disappointment. This one sticks to the story almost religiously.",positive
"What? Stop shouting! This is a brand new and different James Bond? Really? Lets examine that...starts with an action sequence, is given his mission, the bad guy has a peculiar physical trait, wears a tuxedo, another big action sequence, sleeps with an attractive girl...wait, what's this? He falls in love? What's the betting she doesnt make it to the end of the film...yep, thought as much. Oh and there is no characterisation of Bond at all - who the hell is he? He's faceless, we know nothing of him. Alright, so it's technically his first outing, but why do we not get to see the man behind the famous digits? Finish on a big action sequence? Kill off the bad guy? Yeah, it's a WHOLE NEW Bond, NOTHING like the old ones, NO! FFS.",negative
Best Bond since Connery?? Discuss!,positive
Finally a hot Bond that can actually kick some ass!!!,positive
"amazingly good,also has a special meaning :)",positive
This was so sick! Woot!,positive
"Definately my favorite Bond movie, though I felt that the whole integration of technology (mainly the cell phones) when this actually takes place BEFORE all the other movies where there are none... difficult to let go. I'm a little OCD I guess. Still great.",positive
most realistic Bond movie. the action is believable.,positive
"After too many boring Bond movies this is a refreshing one. James Bond isn't anymore a shallow character just running around, shooting and shouting stupid lines. Now he is, thanks to Craig, a charming agent just like in the good old movies.",positive
hottest Bond ever.Makes you wonder why you ever watched another 007movie before. Can't wait till the next one comes out,positive
A bloody masterpiece...,positive
BEST BOND MOVIE EVER!,positive
"Es el inicio de James Bond, al verla es mas facil entender el personaje, su forma de actuar y su forma de ser. las escenas de accion son buenas, pero lo mas bueno es que permite ver los matices de los personajes.",positive
The best Bond movie in quite some time. Craig makes a great Bond.,positive
Probably the best bond movie ever.... superb actor for the bond franchise. Not many gadgets but overall a better movie.. I hope they remake the lot,positive
"Definitely in my top 3 favorite movies of all time, words cannot describe this movie. Fan-freakin'-tastic!",positive
Might just be the best 007 movie ever made!,positive
Well done... Daniel Craig did wonderful job playing Bond.,negative
"Best Bond movie ever. Great pacing, not too much action. A good focus on character and story development. A little too much Sony product placement, but it's brilliant.",positive
The new generation bond. The best bond films this few years.,positive
A great re-invention of the franchise.,negative
a little disappointing but it was ok,negative
"Bond, Vulnerable Bond. Grow up becomes the machine.",negative
"This easily one of the better Bond movies and helped to do a lot to restore the films after the evil that was Pierce and Dalton. I however am under the school of thought that the Bond series should heed one of its own titles ""Live and Let Die"", especially the let die part.",negative
Ã  revoir indÃ©finiment,positive
"An incredibly well made and designed bond film, one of the greatest actually.",negative
the first james bond of daniel creig. a return to the 1960 connory,positive
My favorite James Bond movie.,positive
"NO LAB! YOU CAN SUCK IT, NEW JAMES BOND GUY!",negative
"Best Bond movies in Decades, blows away Brosnon's movies, and definitely better than Roger Moore. Sean Connery has always been my fav. but Daniel Craig is in competition for that spot!",positive
niiiiiice opening credits. not quite the back-to-basics i was expecting. it's still a modern bond movie (no bad thing that).,positive
"Oh, the new Bond is unbelievably beautiful!",positive
"Best Bond ever (bleu eyed and blond) and he really has a ""perfectly-formed arse""",positive
"After rewatching this film, I must say it did a good job of rebooting the franchise. Eva Green did a great job as Vesper and Mikkelsen did likewise as LeChiffre. The movie is very well directed, which is what one should expect from the man who previously directed GoldenEye. Having said this, I do have my quibbles with this film, but before I get into them, I want to emphasize that the positives generally outweigh the negatives on here. Firstly, I prefer the campy yet cold style of Brosnan over the sentimental and dry-humored style of Craig. The latter is a large part of what this film is about, and if you prefer Craig's approach to Brosnan's, then that's your taste and you're entitled to it. I also prefer Connery to Craig, since I feel Connery was generally a more charming Bond. But make no mistake: I still think that Craig did a good job here on his first outing as 007, it's just that I'd rather watch some of the movies with those 2 guys (in the role) than this one. Secondly, I thought the love story got a bit cheesy (thankfully, not too much). While at the cinema it might have felt more impressive, to me after rewatching this flick it just doesn't hit hard anymore. I think they could've downplayed the love story a little bit, since, even though I do like a sense of romantic Bond/Bond girl interplay, I think it should be limited to a degree. Thirdly, I'm not interested in Bond invading M's privacy (he figured out the real meaning behind the ""M"" letter and went as far as getting into her apartment). I hope this breach of professional boundaries is left in the Craig Era and never attempted again in later Bond films. But these are just minor quibbles of mine. Overall, Casino Royale is a worthy entry in the Bond franchise.",positive
"Best Bond movie since License to Kill, and a welcome diversion from the usual Bond formula",positive
"it caught me by surprise, i didnt think it would rank up there with the best of bond, but after seeing it, in my opinion its the best one",positive
i always wondered why i watched the past bond movies. they were so horrible. but casino royale..i actually enjoyed very much and daniel craig is actually suave and not greasy like brosnan or the other 4 bonds. enough with the hair gel!,positive
a good return to the sexy supaspy. Great backstory and insight into the Bond character with some helpful acting skillz from the future knight Sir Daniel Craig.,positive
A new breed of Bond.,positive
"Smart, sexy, and thrilling. The parkour-inspired chase scene was a stunner. (And I'm not usually much of an action-movie fan.)",positive
The dark side of Bond - no smarm but waaay too much card-playing.,positive
"Imaging an outsider stepping in takng the part and instantly being able to carry the crown high and mighty, a Bond that bleeds!! and bond that...does a lot of thing Bond never done before...the only Bond film with women who cant rivet a man..still a damned good Bond film! The best one - yet!",positive
Best Bond yet. Finally a Bond character with some depth.,negative
Best Bond ever! Sorry Sean you just don't have the six pack.,positive
"One of the best Bond films ever. Gritty and real, this wasn't a Bond movie as much as it was a genuine espionage thriller . . . not perfect, but it stands alone as a good movie. And the footchase in the beginning is awesome.",positive
Daniel Craig is the best James Bond since Sean Connery and this is the best Bond flick in a long time.,negative
besten james bond vun den letzten 20 joer,positive
Possibly the best Bond movie ever.,positive
"""Nobody does it half as good as you...baby, baby...baby you're the best."" (The Spy Who Loved Me)",positive
good to see bond rise again,positive
"Superb. All the action, from a new cool (like the trunks) new Bond.",positive
It's a bond film. Nuff said,positive
"I think this is my only favorite bond film. I hate to admit, I just don't like any of the others. I like the idea of bond, but just not the old movies. This one is just really well done. I hope now that they have the origin finished, they will move on with the same style, but adding more of his persona back into it.",negative
"A well-done, action-packed Bond movie. This Bond movie brings new life into the long series.",positive
OK but I like Connery Moore and Brosnan more than the new dude!,positive
"Bond leaves too much of a mess where he goes. no bondlike gadgets. Says he can read faces yet gets tricked in the end. Half the movie is a poker game. Almost all scenes feature bond or someone else either half naked, completely naked, or with a wet T-shirt in the shower. Ridiculous waste of time. The one star is because it was a good action movie had it not been a james bond flick.",negative
Needed more Bond swager had all the elements but that slickness in the bond character.,negative
It was okay. Not a typical Bond movie and I have to see the new James Bond guy in another movie before I can judge how good the new Bond movies are.,negative
I wasn't a Bond fan untill I saw this movie!,positive
"Great come-back from D.A.D. great plot, just like the book.",positive
"This movie was pretty cool in the beginning but I was totally lost by the end. Normally I like twists, but this one mashed them all together. I gave it 2 stars for awesome blow up scenes",negative
Never been into bond...make more of these ones then am there all the way!,positive
Daniel Craig is hawt and the action just keeps on coming. Renewed my faith in the Bond series.,negative
Unorthodox but one os the best Bond movies yet.This is actually a prequel,positive
Probably the best Bond film out there.,positive
New and best BOND ever!!!,positive
"I don't usually like Bond movies but this was okay. Daniel Craig was rather good Bond, liked him lot more than Brosnan.",negative
"better than a lot of the previous films, but not as good as bourne, i fell i might as well add to this out of proportion debate, it was interesting, and daniel Craig was icy cool...",negative
Craig is by far the Bond since Connery. Loved it.,positive
The best Bond ever if not the best action film ever.,positive
Was a good action film in its own right. Enjoyed. But now I'm going down the gym.,positive
Bond is a real character!,positive
With this film James Bond is getting towards the right direction. Hopefully it will continue doing so in the future Bond films.,positive
The best bond ever!!!,positive
Gritty and realistic.,positive
"Wow, never had heard of Daniel Craig before, but what a James Bond he isâ¦ never was too fussed out the 007 movies, but this one has caught my attention. In my opinion, he has a little more of an evil streak to him. Wondering if he is going to do another James Bond movie, interesting to see how he is going to perform in the next one.",positive
I was skeptical at first. Then I just shut up and took in the fun.,positive
"I don't really dig action films, but this one is really good. I didn't really think Craig was the right choice for Bond until I saw him onscreen. He's really quite good... also Judi Dench is a pretty hot dish... just sayin...",negative
All time best James Bond film of all time. Daniel Craig makes great role as bit darker Bond. Soundtracks rules!,positive
WOW! I think I held my breath for the first 10 minutes!,positive
"One of the best James Bond films ever made. Though the ending is a bit drawn out, this is still a fantastic movie.",positive
I love daniel craig. Comparable to early sean connery interpretations (Dr. No and FRWL) and Timothy Dalton.,positive
A tie for my favourite James Bond film. Wasn't even expecting to like Craig.,positive
"didn't quite match the hype, but it was still good",positive
"Didn't feel like bond to me, but if you ignore the 007 part, great action film.",positive
"craig is no connery, but he adds a grittier element to the role that was lacking in the originals. he is a realer Bond, and the script and cinematography back him up well.",positive
Daniel Craig makes me mess myself. But in a good way.,positive
"thank fuck for this new bond. hey nick, guess who wrote it? hahahahaha paul haggis.",positive
craig makes a suprisingly good bond,positive
Only James Bond movie I watched.,negative
"definately not as good as the classics, but not bad",positive
Loved it...best Bond EVER,positive
"It IS the best Bond film. Daniel Craig had a tough act to follow. everyone was cursing him before the film was released. He is an awesome actor and brought a new edge to Bond, much more in keeping with the original character in the books. Shame about Eva Green, but the more you see it, the less irritating she becomes. And you just have to love that car...",positive
"Yes, the tone is right, and the new guy's pretty good. It's too faithful to the source material, though, which means it has some boring parts. Lazenby's still it for me.",negative
is the shyt people ..omg is worth watching homies,positive
Best return to the true nature of the literary Bond!,positive
I didn't like it as much as other people did,negative
"Bond as he used to be, before the PC crowd got to the franchise. Bond is not a nice guy...he is a borderline psychopath, and this shows him in all his glory.",positive
My favorite Bond Movie. Extremely entertaining.,positive
"Awesome James Bond, except the poker game was drawn out",positive
I loved it. I cried when Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) Died... But i guess she deserved it... i guess?,positive
Bond in more than two dimensions? Nice.,negative
about forty minutes too long,negative
4 stars for Daniel Craig alone!,positive
"Compared to Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig is nothing in the role of James Bond..",negative
"Best 007 for me and the easiest on the eye, but hey he's from Chester so I guess I am going to say that! Its about time the girls got a ""coming out of the sea scene"" !!! It's the only bond movie i own on dvd... that says it all really!",positive
"Best bond ever: ruthless, cold and effective.",positive
I saw it on a whim and was glad i did,negative
"It's really good, but I think just a bit toooo long.",negative
Daniel Craig is up there with the best Bond actors on this evidence,positive
Daniel Craig is soo good at Bond. I love the darker approach.,positive
I think it's the best Bond movie (maybe) ever.,positive
"This movie explains why Bond is such a man slut! This movie is action packed, has great gadgets (as usual) & Daniel Craig is perfect in the role as 007. My Fave quote....""you don't know what i can do with my little finger!"" - swoon ;-)",positive
"Daniel Craig was an awesome bond, the best since Sean Connery",positive
"an amazing movie of early bondish character, you can easily see Connery doing those things as a youth and then learning the smoother ways and the ladies ways.",positive
Really enjoyed this film. Opening stunt was amazing. Torture scene on chair looked uncomfortable.,positive
attempts to reinvent the series and does a decent job... interesting story with a few unexpected and un-Bond-like twists...,positive
Bond with an attitude,positive
back to basics. awesome.,positive
good to see Bond is tough again.,negative
The new bond is bad ass.,positive
Great Movie. Only a true Bond movies during the last 15 minutes. But great overall,positive
The best Bond movie yet. Daniel Craig is awesome.,negative
"Not the best Bond film but as of late it certainly stands out, particularly after the last few Bond films... This film has everything that a Bond film should have, but how could they destroy that Aston! Ah well, at least now we get to see a new Bond with a decent storyline and no American influence.",positive
uudeks bondiks Ã¤Ã¤rettÃ¶mÃ¤n hyvÃ¤,positive
Daniel Craig - need I say more?,positive
"The best Bond movie since Goldeneye. All those gadgets disappear here as Bond becomes one bad mo fo.Can't wait for Bond 22, Craig is the best Bond since Connery. Enjoy.",positive
I definitely approve of the new JB.,positive
"I wasn't sure about the decision to cast Craig as Bond, but oh my gosh! He is THE best one!",positive
The opening credits animation and the first action chase were enough to make me love this movie instantly.,negative
My favourite James Bond film. Daniel Craig actualy makes a good James Bond. A welcome change from Pierce Brosnan. Plus I just love Daniel Craig.,positive
"I was pleasantly surprised by this. I liked Pierce's first effort, and I loved this one. If the franchise moves in this direction, I'll continue to go see them.",positive
Watch the chase scene in the first 15 minutes and you'll know why this movie is amazing!,positive
One of the best Bonds. Perhaps the best if you take away the nostalgia factor,positive
Narrative structure? In MY Bond movie?,negative
"Best bond film ever, had it all!",positive
"Den bästa Bond-filmen. Bond är ung och oslipad, så det blir lite söligt när han gör sitt första beställnings-mord. Grymt bra, psykologisk poker-scen, och filmen inleds också med en cool parkour-jakt uppför en byggnad (biljakter är SÅ 90-tal).",positive
"Exactly what the franchise needed. Best film of 2006, without a shadow of a doubt. Fantastic action, razor sharp dialogue and all the hallmarks of a new and improved Bond series. Manages to bring Bond up to date, whilst retaining the heart of soul of what the film has to be. Makes you feel very punch and engage with every hand dealt. Who knew a film about a poker game could be quite so gripping.",positive
So young James Bond looks 50?,negative
Being a huge poker fan this movie is really good just because of that. Daniel Craig does a great job taking over and I was never bored with the movie.,positive
"Intense, awesome, enough said.",positive
"Very interesting twists, deffinitely worth watching if you haven't seen it yet",positive
Finally a good Bond again.,positive
"Gr8 flick with eyewatering scene when Bond gets his bollocks whipped! ""Now the whole world know that you died sratching my balls!!"" Daniel Craig wipes the floor with Connery, Brosnan, Moore and the other two shites!",positive
"Casino Royale singlehandedly saved the Bond franchise after the ZERO-star debacle that was ""Die Another Day."" Craig is tremendous as Bond, there's none of the Austin Powers-esque cheese, and the B&W opening sequence and title animations are among the best ever.",positive
"brilliant movie, even from a non-bond fan! eva green is freakin' gorgeous!",positive
One of the Best Bond movies ever,positive
"That card game goes on forever, and they killed the hot girl. Did anybody notice the main girl had one tooth that kind of stuck out? That bothered me through the entire movie in the theater, but you can't really see it on tv.",positive
Mr Craig you are a fantastic 'James Bond',positive
The best bond in every aspect.,positive
The best Bond movie ever made. And Daniel Craig is the best Bond character since Sean Connery!,positive
"Action packed, Bond is so smooth as usual.",negative
Best Bond film in twenty years! Daniel Craig is Bond....James Bond!,positive
Best of the Bond movies I've seen...,positive
Best Bond movie ever,positive
"No cheesy one-liners, a hot new Bond, and a decent plot. My only beef was the movie felt like it would never end.",negative
"Interesting take on Bond and his history. Bond was never that brutal and I'm pretty sure he wouldn't get softer as he got older. I suppose this is a Bond for modern movies... so dumber, need for more action, and not nearly as subtle. BTW movie was 30-45 minutes too long.",negative
great new era of James Bond movies.,positive
"This is exactly what we needed after years of Pierce Brosnan driving an invisible BMW (you see Pierce Brosnan's oily hairpiece cruising through the air in a Parisian parking garage, and then you are shot) and the Bond people knew it",positive
"You know what? I've always thought the Bond films were overrated, albeit very interesting. Yes, Sean Connery created a legendary screen icon; however, by today's standards his performances were decent at best. Casino Royale is, in my opinion, the greatest Bond flick ever made. Why? Because, it stands alone (without the franchise) as a brilliant executed & highly enjoyable thriller. Tightly wound & played flawlessly by Daniel Craig, this film has set the new standard for future outings with 007.",positive
"I hate James Bond sequences however this one is quite different, absolutely great. Daniel Craig didn't seem to be a James Bond guy at first however in the movie i'd admited that he was the right choice for the role.",positive
"Best ""pre-bond song"" of the ENTIRE series. Best intro to a Bond film. Daniel Craig will be around for a while.",negative
i wanted more action...but i love him as JB,negative
comeback of the bond films! but it left me wanting more...like something was still missing...,negative
"En lo personal, se me hacia dificil imaginar un nuevo Bond y sobre todo tan diferente a Brosnan, pero esta gente logrÃ³ reinventarse a James Bond.",negative
"The one and only Bond movie that I really liked. Daniel Craig is sexy, charismatic and much more edgy than any other Bonds",positive
THe Bad AZZ NEW JAMES BOD,positive
I havent seen all the james bond movies...but this one was great,positive
Craig turned out to be an excellen choice to bring in a new era of Bond. He and Dalton are the only ones anything like the Bond of Fleming's books. Look forward to his next one.,positive
"'You Know My Name!...and you know that this is by far the best James Bond movie ever made in the franchise history. First of all, the movie stayed true to the book Ian Flemming wrote save for modern reditions. Otherwise the movie has more twist and turns and the ending is absolutely marvellous. 'The only question remaining is, will you yeild in time?'",positive
my favorite movie of all time,positive
liked it alot and the new direction bond is taking,positive
My favorite James Bond movie. Texas Hold 'Em + James Bond = Awesome!,positive
"I haven't enjoyed sitting through an entire Bond moive as much as I did in this one. I don't own any other 007 movies on DVD except this one, that's how good it was to overcome my bordom with the series.",positive
"This was a wicked film! prob one of the best bond films ever. lve it when he orders the drink in the casino. I dont care what people say about the franchise of bond is doomed, how can it be with this film!",positive
"A lot of people, like myself, was shocked that of all the actors in the industry Daniel Craig was chosen to play Bond. However, this launch for the revival of the Bond Movies was amazing.",positive
A awesome update of the bond series he kicks some serious a%^,positive
"I like it, I actually like it.",negative
Has a cool story line and almost ups the cunning with the originals of James Bond. Funny moments and awesome action scenes make this the best spy movie of 2006.,positive
"it was absolutely wonderful. but you have to realize that if James Bond ever tells a girl that he loves her, she is going to die.",positive
"Disappointing. I'll want to see another one before dismissing the direction the franchise is taking. I appreciate why they wanted to go darker and more serious, but I like the Bond movies better when they were fun. Big mistake to have two female characters look nearly identical, but good move to keep Judy Dench, and I'm delighted to see Felix return. Daniel Craig could use some new facial expressions.",negative
"My favorite Bond movie so far, very well done. Daniel Craig's body is super hot as well.",positive
"I'm not much of a James Bond fan actually, however this film was quite by the dozen of similar, non-JB action movies. Quite many ads in it as well.",negative
A decent turn for 007 after all the shit they were churning out. But how come I get the feeling Bond tries to be more like Bourne?,negative
Excellent movie. One of the ONLY Bond movies I've ever watched in entirety.,positive
The action peices in this are extremely well done and the story and tone are much grittier and realistic than the others. The first Bond film since Goldeneye I can honestly say I enjoyed - loved even.,positive
Actually much better what I expected.,negative
I really enjoyed this. Bond wasn't so cold and you got to see beyond his normal persona.,positive
"WOW. Gritty, dirty, Bond. Hot and tough. Open scene was one of the best I've ever seen! I'm a huge Bond fan. I've loved them for years. This one blew me away. It's unlike all the others",positive
Best Bond since Goldeneye.,positive
Best bond for a long time. Brings a different side of Bond to the table. Can't wait for the next ones.,positive
"Good film, toture scene made me wince a bit!",negative
"Bond and Batman have a lot in common, aside from being male hero archetypes. The Batman films started quite edgy and dark under Burton's direction, then turned to the over-the-top campy self-parody (like the 60s predecessor), and was finally rescued by a new lead actor, new director, and a second take on the origins of the character. Likewise, the much longer-running (thus, more extensively bastardized) James Bond series was classy - if somewhat unbelievable - to start, but recently degraded into self-conscious special effects demos and plain stupid dialogue. Here it is revisited and reinvented with a new lead actor, a new director, and a new look at Bond's story. The result is impressive, among the most memorable of the Bond movies and certainly a head above the recent ones. Craig carries Bond with a classic British wit and charm, paradoxically dignified and irreverent. His love interest matches him line for line. The dialogue, though stilted as always, possesses a cleverness to it that prevents it from degrading into the cheese that mires most of Hollywood, nevermind just the Bond films. Several scenes and characters feel contrived - the requisite villain-with-strange-disfiguration is present - but still this film feels more real than any one that came before it. For the first time in our generation of cinema, fans can look forward to intelligent, compelling, and genuinely romantic Bond films. Welcome back James.",positive
"Way more depth than the average Bond, due to Craig's blonde-Bondshell performance, more natualistic violence, and an interesting plot about Bond's origins. However, whilst the plot is more interesting than your standard Bond, this is also the film's biggest weak-point - the best action sequence comes ten minutes in, the showdown with the villain half-way through - and Bond doesnt even get to kill him. Where was the big underwater base that blows up at the end? The hundreds of henchman to kill? File under interesting but ulitmately unsatisfying.",negative
"Fantastic, a refreshing new Bond movie after the slump with (although I do love him) Pierce. Daniel is right up there with Sean!",positive
Daniel Craig.........need I say more,positive
"Daniel Craig as James Bonds, just does not mix. ok movie.",negative
Fell asleep . . . probably the worst Bond I've seen.,negative
The creation of Bond. I think that it was different from the other Bond movies because it had to be to show the evolution of his personality into the a@$ that he exhibits.,positive
Loved it. I never been a Bond fan simply because I found the franschise a bit too chessy and over acted and ricdicoulous stories. But with this reboot we get an approach more grounded in reality which I fairly like. I thought Craig did a great job he is quickly becoming a fav actor of mine. Glad they kept Juy Dench as M.,positive
I liked what I saw of it. I'll probably like it better if I manage to see it in full context sometime.,negative
Best Bond film by far...the closest any Bond film has got to the books...A1,positive
Bond Ã¤r inte alltid Bond. I senaste filmen var han nÃ¤stan mÃ¤nsklig. Jag gillade den skarpt.,positive
"This is what Bond Movies have become? Style and flash over substance? Sure, I liked ""Goldeneye"" but I would prefer my older Bond movies back.",negative
I love Bond films. Daniel Craig is great taking Bond in a different direction from Pierce Brosnan (who had the character down to a tee). Amazing action sequences - here's to the next one!,positive
Best Bond in a long time!,positive
the best bond film yet.,positive
Good stuff. The return of Bond's beginning is done well. A bit boring during the poker scenes and kind of confusing towards the end.,positive
the new #2 bond actor. loved this film,positive
"One of the best action movies I've ever seen. Surprisingly tender, brutal when it has to be, gripping throughout.",positive
Good action and acting only if you like the new bond. I think hes good.,positive
"Finally a Bond movie faithful to Ian Fleming's Bond - not the usual ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" crap (whose formula you know: larger-than-life villains inside incredible lair trying to take over the world and a Bond that's just there to deliver zing lines). It's a movie that doesn't rely on its cliches. Finally!",positive
"Daniel Criag was a bit too blonde, but way badass. gj.",positive
"The best Bond for this century! IÂ´ve seen all Bond films and yes, they are all great.",positive
"The first Bond movie I've ever seen. Can I say, ""Wow""?",positive
ace! huge! my fav bond film by far!!!,positive
"I'm still torn over Daniel Craig. Yes, he delivers a solid performance, and I've enjoyed Craig since Layer Cake. Still, I was hoping Clive Owen would become the new Bond, and I still find it hard to accept a blonde 007. Other than that, while there's solid action at the beginning of the film,, the middle slows to a crawl, and watching a poker match is not at all exciting.",negative
First James Bond movie I've seen. Can't wait for the sequel!,positive
"One of the best Bond movies, nice to go back to the roots.",positive
Best Bond movie that I've ever seen.,positive
This is the 1st Bond movie I've ever seen....and I loved it!,positive
"Ei perinteinen Bond, mutta silti paras 007 koskaan!!",positive
blone bond??? good choice great film,positive
"Daniel Craig is strangely sexy as i would never have expected from his wooden performance in Layer Cake. Apart from the cringey finger sucking scene and some pouty moments, absolutely brilliant...Best Bond Film by far!",positive
"Hottest Bond EVER =] ""now everyone will know you've been itching my balls"" =]",positive
Good spin on Bond and Daniel Craig makes a good 007,positive
It's James Bond=brill With a new direction=even briller Though the 'who is behind it all' is a bit annoying and they shouldn't do a sequel to a Bond film.,positive
"The new James Blonde! Good explosive movie. One guy against the world, wow.",negative
"How to make Bond look like a night club bouncer in three easy steps. So we have Hotel Pupp starring in this one, which has to be one of the worst bonds ever!",negative
Wasn't convinced initially about his appointment but Daniel Craig excels in what is probably the best 007 film ever made! :D,positive
good acting but not as good as the classics,positive
I knew that bitch wasn't all cracked up to be.. and *ouch* to the ball thumping scene..,negative
"It seriously woz da best bond ever, even if Daniel Craig doesn't luk like ur typical James Bond, he woz gr8!!!x",positive
OMG Daniel Craig is the sexiest Bond!! AHHHH!!,positive
"Craig is NOT on par with Connery, not even at the same level. this film was enjoyable, but ultimately lacking",negative
The first James Bond Movie...Set In 1960...WTF A MOBILE PHONE!,negative
The best bond movie ever?? but then I havnt seen many bond movies and Daniel Craig .. me thinks is the best bond .. and Eva Green surely helps a lot,positive
"OMG probably the best James Bond ever, Daniel Craig is just beautiful too! Just love this film will watch it over and over again!",positive
"A solid bond. I like craigs version. Human, hurt, complex. Disliked the poker-parts, but liked the action parts. Good job.",positive
"I know some say he looks more like a KGB agent than a Bond but this movie was Aces. Fantastic plot, witty script and fabulous action sequences. It would be a waste not to see it.",positive
"Best Bond movie yet. Daniel Craig is perfect, Eva Green was gorgeous, and every aspect of this movie is good.",positive
better than expected,positive
Daniel Craig is the man for that job. Too much poker. Poker poker poker. I hope the next one is set in a strip joint.,negative
It's a longer film than I would have liked. Don't watch it tired because there is a lot of details to be appreciated. A great breath of fresh air into the bond series - captures the mood of the early films (see Dr. No) and adds today's action.,positive
"Good movie, Bond finally has balls again.",positive
The best Bond ever. Great combination of action and realism. Craig was just perfect.,positive
Classy and impressive.,positive
"1er James Bond avec Daniel Craig : j'ai longtemps hésité à le regarder. En effet, c'est assez médiocre. Beaucoup de longueurs, pas de gadget, musique très absente. Bref, un passage obligé pour aborder les épisodes suivant, qui ont meilleur réputation.",negative
Bond is back with a vengeance!! best one ever!!,positive
I like how hardly anybody cared who or what daniel craig was and then his movie came out and now all his previous movies are on shelves both the shitty and the decent.,negative
Great way to begin a new Bond.,positive
"Nice style of Bond. Definitely liked Craig as Bond. This movie was more ""real"" than the others",positive
One of the better Bond films. This one actually had a story. I will definitly watch the sequel next November,positive
"As a Bond fan, I must say - one of the worst Bond films. Sure, it was entertaining but not at the same caliber as normal and it did not live up to its hype.",negative
worst bond movie ever,negative
"A pretty entertaining movie. Not sure about Daniel Craig as James Bond, but Eva Green as Vesper was a great character. I love poker, so naturally I loved this movie!",negative
Fantastic! Bond is back with a vengeance.,positive
Daniel Craig is great! Loved it!,positive
The best bond movie ever. Craig has brought bond back.,positive
Best James Bond with Golden Finger :D,positive
"Hated it, especially compared to the older movies and the other actors.",negative
One of the better Bond movie. Daniel Craig is ruthless!!,positive
HOT!! Best Bond movie in years,positive
"If you can put the camp and silly Bond films of the past into the back of your mind and forget they exist, this stunning movie will be even more...well stunning! It has all the ingredients of a great action adventure and Craig is great as the new style Bond in this gritty and more serious offering.",positive
"favorite bond movie of all time, craig is an amazing bond. im not gonna say the best, but he brings a new spin on the character, amazing!!!",positive
"A tad light on the action, and not entirely a welcome refresher on the Bond series, but still packing a decent 'should see'.",negative
Better than the old one...a good replacement for Peirce Bros.,positive
quality. bond is tough and gritty and makes brosnan look like he was filming a shampoo commercial. bring on the next movie.,positive
"A new kind of Bond, and one that hits the mark, best not to try and compare to the older style too much and it is easier to see that this is a very good film.",positive
"Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever. So fit, so ice cool. Makes Bond a beleivable person.",positive
I am a bond fan... i was nervous about the new bond but it was an AMAZING movie and he does a great job.,positive
"At first worried about Daniel Craig as Bond, but he was amazing, This film rocked, but I missed Moneypenny and Q",positive
one of my fovorite bond movies,positive
Daniel Craig in a suit with a gun........ummmmm,positive
The names Bond and its bloody good! Best bond to date!,positive
"good action, but alittle to gory for me",negative
"Kulere enn de andre Bondfilmene, men likevel ikke helt i mitt favoritt-sjikte.",negative
If only this movie was as good as the openning scene....,negative
Knappt godkÃ¤nd- PÃ¥ tok fÃ¶r mycket poker. Actionsekvenserna som inleder filmen Ã¤r dock ok.,negative
"This is the reply to the also brilliant Bourne films, and Daniel Craig completely nails this part, again giving the character the respect it should have had for years. In a fight Bond would be covered in his own blood and bruises but would kick the shit out of Jason Bourne (eventually).",positive
i still cringe at the thought of this movie,positive
The best Bond film in years.,positive
"Ha ha, YES! Love this movie. Another one that I know is not particularly ground breaking or meaningful, but will watch anyway. Any time. Great popcorn flick- Mind-blowing action, and Mr. Craig is certainly easy on the eyes.",positive
"Update: Have just watched this film again and think Daniel Craig is absolutely ace as Bond. However, I still think the heart re-start bit is utterly ridiculous, and couldn't they have just ended the film half hour early and saved the girlfriend f*cked-him-over bit until the begining of the next Bond film???? (I don't care if it follows the book, it just doesn't translate well to the screen!)",positive
"I have NEVER been a fan of the Bond franchise (though I always thought Sean Connery was cool) precisely because it made Bond out to be a pansy who had to rely on impossibly silly gadgets, and who bedded every female in sight. Casino Royale blows that idea out of the water with a truly fascinating script (thanks, co-writer Paul Haggis!), GREAT acting (courtesy of upcoming greats like Daniel Craig, Eva Green and Jeffrey Wright), and an earnest physicality that keeps you involved through every gut-wrenching or glorious scene. I'm now hooked and will watch any new Bond movie this guy is in.",negative
This movie was a 4 until the last 45 minutes. Minus 2 for not finishing,negative
"bond, w/o the restraint and corny inuendos. so hard",positive
the torture seen was nasty.,positive
BEST BOND MOVIE! CRAIG RULES!,positive
Just watch and you will understand whay it is so oh-la-la,negative
What's not to love!! High octane action from start to finish....and HELLO Daniel Craig...woof!,positive
"dry at times, but still a greatt bond",positive
"Probably the best James Bond ever, Daniel Craig really made it here",positive
James bond just got an eliment of cool. This has to be the best bond movies off all time.,positive
In my opinion this is the best Bond that i saw. I hate the James Bonds movies but this one is more real than the others and you will see the truth skills of this agent.,positive
I didn't expect Daniel Craig will do good but he really does! And his body is hot too!,positive
Jag Ã¤lskar den nyaste Bond!,positive
Awesome and makes the other Bond movies look shitter than they already are.,positive
"Slows down far too much in the middle, could have been trimmed by 30 minutes",negative
Best one since Goldeneye,positive
MMM.... Daniel Craig,positive
"This brings a new darker side to bond, something that had been slightly lost in some of the previous films, excellent action, good plot. Although i hope the traditional bond start will be brought back in the next film",positive
"More depth, more gritty than your average bond movie...",positive
Easily the best Bond movie.,positive
I just luv those fast trains in Montenegro! :))))),negative
really good change for james bond,positive
Daniel Craig is the best bond yet,positive
Was very uncertain how good Daniel Craig would be as Bond but he pulled it off. No gadgets but a good story and a great addition to the Bond series,positive
The best James Bond ever.,positive
Bond is back and in a good way. Pretty accurate to the book. They just modernized the story a little bit. Craig pumps new life into the Bond franchise. The theme song is awesome too probably the best out of any 007 movie.,positive
"Great flim, shitty actor, should have got CLIVE OWEN..",negative
Classic Bond stuff. But spent too much time playing cards and not enough spying.,negative
"To my shame, this is the first Bond film I've ever seen at the cinema. I thought it was great. Far more realistic than its predecessors. It's the Bourne Identity but with cooler cars.",positive
as fun as watching poker on tv,negative
It was good... and that's saying A LOT from me since I don't care for Bond.,negative
"Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery by far. After boring action movie after boring action movie, Casino Royale delivers an actually artful rendering of the James Bond character. This was a great movie, and the first Bond film I've liked in forever.",positive
Favourite Bond so far..,positive
I'm not big into the 007 films but this one intrigued me...I think Daniel Craig might be my favorite Bond.,positive
Craig had a lot to live up to as the new Bond. I'm still warming up to him as a character.,negative
"it's worse than I expected. There's a lot of buzz before I netflix it, but it's just okay. The whole fighting is fun...but it's just okay. There are some twists, but not smart enough.",negative
This was the first James Bond movie that I've ever seen and I absolutely fell in love with it. Daniel Craig is amazing and he does a fantastic job.,positive
"Okay, okay, I'll admit it...I haven't seen any of the original Bond films so whether or not this is anything like its predecessor; I have no clue. I will save this though: taken as is...this is a GREAT movie. I can't wait until Bond 22 comes out!",positive
This felt nothing like the old bonds. But it was pretty good just as a movie. Daniel's very pretty.,positive
"hot hot hot hot hot, what is it about daniel craig??? this by far is the best bond movie I have ever seen",positive
"Since it's Bond, I had to go see it. I fell asleep though, which is a first to Bond movies. It seemed like the only action scene was the foot chase...the highlight for a Bond movie is a foot chase? Lame.",negative
how can this guy be 007? he looks sooo out of place...,negative
the best movie ever!!,positive
well i was doubtfull when they announced that Craig was going to be Bond but hats off to the guy cause this is the best Bond movie ever made,positive
My favorite Bond of all time. Daniel Craig delivers a new dangerous and serious version of the world's most famous spy.,positive
"at last we see bond as a proper double agent, getting fucked up and smashing the bad guys, love the scene with the chair and rope!",positive
Daniel Craig is a kick-ass James Bond,positive
No real plot but i loved it anyway!,negative
most entertaining bond movie yet,positive
Very fascinating movie. i assure you will love it :),positive
"best bond since live and let die. no shite sfx, quite gritty and dark in parts. the bit in venice was predictable tho. never trust a bird, bond !",positive
Bler aldri lei av James Bond:),positive
Very good effort to show the origin of bond james bond.,positive
"Okay, so what was good and what was bad? Well, first the good side. It incorporates Montenegro, which is not actually in the movie (Italy) but it is still cool. It has good action sequences with free running and speeding trucks with planes. It has a descent story and idea. The Aston Martin gets trashed (hilarious) and Eva Green is pretty cute. The bad parts? Daniel Craig is James Bond. Mistake number one. He just doesn't cut it. The guy is way too crude to be James Bond. I mean look at the past Bonds like Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan. They had this cool refined character and kicked ass. This guy is like an English Bruce Willis in a Die Hard movie type James Bond, hence the mistake. Still, he wasn't a terrible choice, I mean I thought the guy was great in Layer Cake but that was more of a role for him. This movie really wasn't. Mistake number two was the retarded ending. You think everything is fine and dandy and then, oh let's throw in another plot twister and confuse the shit out of the audience. Sure she tried to kill him but he still loves her. F*ing lame! So, overall still a great movie but almost a missed opportunity. I just hope that if there are any more Bond movies, Daniel Craig isn't in them. They would be better off putting House (Hugh Laurie) as James Bond. At least he would be intelligent. LOL",positive
About time we had a Bond with a bit more grit and bite. I think they could have done better than Eva Green for the Bond girl though. Also the Texas Hold'em Poker sequences were a bit bullshit - if that last hand came up at a match of that magnitude I think the dealer would have been stabbed to death.,positive
"Great Bond movie. Personally, I think its one of the best Bond films since Goldeneye. Great acting, not a lot of insane gadgets. Of course the amazing cars are always a plus. You definatley cant forget the great free-running chase at the beginning of the movie. It was truly epic.",positive
I was not impressed. Sean Connery will always be James Bond in my mind.,negative
"What can you say? It's Bond, and everybody loves a bit of Bond.",positive
damn boring. if i wanted to watch suspenseful poker i could tune in to the poker world championships and save my self the 7 bucks for renting the damn thing,negative
Top notch! Finally a Bond film where he actually gets violent. Best bond by far.,positive
My favorite!!! I could watch this every day!,positive
Just for the interigation scene alone!!,positive
"Its not the best James Bond movie out there, but Daniel Craig gives credit to the Bond line. Much more rough and gritty in the action which I actually enjoy over Pierce.",positive
Bond er altid godt og synes Daniel Craig gør det godt som 007,positive
This is the only Bond movie I've ever (a) watched all the way through and (b) enjoyed.,positive
"oh, the awesomeness of bond. james bond.",positive
J'emmerde tous ceux qui disent que ce film est mauvais. et j'enmerde tous ceux qui disent que james bond est brun et pas blond. c'est un bon film d'action point barre.,positive
"Nothing like the orginal, but keeps you on the edge of the couch! daniel craig makes a good new bond, was sceptical at first",positive
"Bond of recent has become to much special effects and gadgets and overshadowed by the much better Bourne series, nevertheless this movie is one of the better Bond movies.",positive
"I liked it, But I like Pierce Brosnon better, plus the story made no sense to me at all",negative
"Finally, a James Bond movie with a bit of bite and interest. I'd been getting pretty bored with them before this one.",positive
"The people who trash this film trash the very essence of Bond. He was never supposed to be the cartoony figure with the stupid gadgets and the slow moving machines of certain death. This movie took Bond back to the Bond of the original books and it was about time. The only issue I have with this film involves some of the pacing towards the end. Other than that... it's flawless. Oh, and I nearly forgot the crappy theme song. Where you aware that Chris Cornell was still alive?",positive
One of the best bond films. gritty and gripping,positive
best Bond film ever made,positive
OOOH DANIEL CRAIG IS SOO HOT RITE NOW.,positive
YllÃ¤tti positiivisesti.,negative
Insan nasil olurda James Bond sarisin olur diye sasiyor ama filme gidince adamin performansini takdir ediyorsunuz,positive
"I mostly liked the beginning and the end. Don't usually like action, but this was okay.",negative
Arguably one of the best 007s. Without a doubt one of the top three.,positive
Tama olikin yllattavan hyva,positive
"Not the best bond, but in the top five. First half - Best bond film ever; Second half - one of the worst. stil worth seeing.",negative
"One of the best reviewed films of 2006, thanks to Paul Haggis's centered script and Martin Campbell's tight direction. Its best asset, however, is Daniel Craig, who uses Sean Connery's earliest performances as 007 as the template for a rougher, leaner, less sophisticated James Bond than we've seen since 1963's ""From Russia with Love"". Several scenes are inspired, such as the foot chase through an African construction site, the center-piece card game, and the torture of a naked Bond. Plus, the story personalizes the hero, investing the viewer in all of 007's endeavors here.",positive
"Kova pätkä. Paras bondi, mutta se nyt ei oo mikään saavutus.",negative
"I saw this movie the day after Thanksgiving instead of Bobby because Emilio Estevez can't write for crap. I certainly don't regret seeing this exquisite prequel, especially because I found it somewhat applicable to my own life. Only my Vesper Lynd was a girl I met at my on-campus job a month or two before. And instead of committing suicide, my Vesper chose to go back to her old boyfriend- er, loyalty. More about this later.",positive
Daniel Craig does an amazing job as Bond. I love how Bond's character is more gritty and violent in contrast to the other portrayals in the past.,positive
And now we know why Bond is a fan of the Hit it and Quit it club...basically the hott chick doubled on him to save him and then deliberately kept herself from being saved....what a dumb bitch!!!!...but the movie is awesome!!!,positive
Daniel Craig is a bad ass new Bond,positive
Wonderful. I'm really looking forward to the next one. James Bond went from used and old and tired to refreshing and interesting.,positive
I like the older Bond movies better.. This one is pretty morbid.,negative
Uneven. Good scenes but woven together haphazardly. And I didn't buy the love story at all.,negative
I thought that they did an excellent job with the 'Bond Origins' concept. Daniel Craig proved that he has what it takes to fill Bond's shoes. He is my favorite Bond since Connery. Can't wait to see where the francise decides to go next.,positive
I loved the girl's purple dress,positive
"Alright, nothing to get excited about, better than previous bond outings, but not sure about this new direction, perhaps there is no where else to go.",negative
"Best bond movie for a while, a lot more realistic than some of the other recent ones. Daniel Craig is wonderful and just enough emotion in it to make it really accessible. A little long-winded, but otherwise enjoyable",positive
One of the best James Bond movies ever.,positive
1st 1/2 is great. 2nd 1/2 is dreaful. Craig does better than I expected but the story is weak even for a Bond film.,negative
"Finally, back to the basics. Looks like bond is back on track",positive
k i absoulutly love these types of action films. i thought the new james bond guy was gonna stink cause i like pierce broswin as a james bond. but i was pretty impressed!,positive
Good James Bond. I've pretty much seen them all.,positive
best bond flick ever. period.,positive
This movie is freaking awesome.,positive
More bond like this please.,positive
"Loved it, loved it, loved it...a must watch if you're a Bond fan.",positive
"Best Bond film by a mile Daniel Craig is excellent, A rollercoaster ride of adenalin filled action!",positive
i love vesper's ring tone!!! i like daniel craig as 007 a lot better than pierce brosnan,positive
daniel craig in those shorts !!!,positive
there wasn;t ebough action. Complete dissapointment. way too much touchy feely crap and not enough shooting,negative
"Just saw it, pretty good flick",positive
Bond is definitely back!,positive
"Best bond film: possibly Best bond actor: perhaps Best action: Goldeneye, then this",positive
I didnt like james bond movies till this one!,positive
"Wasnt sure I'd like Daniel Craig as bond but I thought he was good, really enjoyed the film!",positive
"best bond movie since the connery days, in your face brosnan! trying to kill of bond!",positive
i want one of those ...... DC delish !,positive
Enfin un james bond conforme Ã  l'esprit de ian fleming,positive
great action; keeps you on the edge of your seat. i think its the best james bond,positive
Craig brought back the coolness of Connery to the Bond series.,positive
the best bond since goldeneye,positive
"The first Bond movie I've sat the whole way through. Plenty of action, violence and even some actual emotion from the uber Playboy ;) Daniel Craig and Eva Green are equal in terms of hotness and THOSE trunks are definitely worth the wait ;)",positive
Best Bond movie. Some of us actually prefer a little realism and no cheese.,positive
"Everyone was saying that Daniel Craig would be a terrible Bond and was worrying that this movie wasn't going to be good, myself included. Instead we get one of the best Bond movies (in my opinion the best) ever! This was how Ian Fleming portrayed James Bond in his novels!",positive
"Good movie, and Daniel Craig makes a good actor. Could have had a better plot to it.",positive
"terrible film, even compared to the long line of terrible bond movies. this guy would never get laid in real life.",negative
"Like Daniel Craig, mmm. The action is faulty at times, like jumping on the cranes, and the never-ending sinking building in Venice. But still good plot.",positive
"Daniel Craig is the best bond yet, and not as completely girl crazy as the others, yes it was a bit violent but that made it different from the others. Love this!",positive
"Besides the Sean Connery Bond movies, this is the best Bond movie I've seen. Absolutely amazing.",positive
"The first Bond flick I could actually finish, and I frickin' LOVED it! Daniel Craig just made himself a star!",positive
Daniel Craig in those blue shorts were enough for me!,positive
Both classic and classy. It has a glamorously nostalgic flavor about it but stays modern.,positive
only james bond moive i ever saw,negative
good movie to watch with my husband,negative
"the best bond movie ever, the best bond yet",positive
This is really this generations first Bond movie as well as it was the first Bond story created. First rate action sequences cleanly interwoven with quiet suspence. Classy.,positive
Good job. A very good job. Bring on more of them now!,positive
Best Bond flick in 30 years.,positive
Daniel Craig is a cool Bond! Atleast he has got substance as opposed to just the good looks of Brosnon and pathetic Timothy Dalton.,positive
Really enjoyed this new Bond. Probably the bloodiest one I've seen.,positive
"Alright, goldeneye was better. THis movie didn't even have the provocative intro song like a bond movie should have.",negative
The best James Bond movie for a while now!,positive
As good as any Bond film in the series. Daniel Craig is arguably the best Bond since Connery (although Lazenby was not given a true chance to succeed!),positive
The name is Bond... Jason Bourne.,negative
One of the most solid movies to come out in a long while. I'll hold judgement regarding his meddle against all other Bonds until 22 or maybe 23 ...,positive
Takes Bond to a new level. Craig is the new Connery.,positive
One of my Favorite movies. Definetly the best bond film ever made.,positive
"wow, ok, so i didn't like this one too much.",negative
"Ai, blijkbaar vind iedereen die hier goed. Ik vond die slecht. Gewoon slecht.",negative
He made a better Bond than I thought--I like this one best,positive
"this is for you my dear, casino royal and massge in shanghai, huh??",positive
brilliant. i love eva green even more.,positive
Will Craig be the best Bond ever?,positive
"This movie is one of the best, if not the best, bond films out there. And it certainly made a good run in becoming the best movie of 2006. It has everything a great movie needs, characters, character development, directing, cinematography... I could go on. You really feel that Bond is fighting for his life in this film, and to me, to be able to finally feel and believe that he is a REAL character, bravo. Great movie. The only flaw that I can see with the movie is the lack of the Aston Martins screen time.",positive
This is a great movie & Daniel Craig plays James Bond just like he is in the books. Not bad to look at either which certainly helps!! :-),positive
"I am a die-hard Sean Connery fan, but Daniel Craig is a great Bond, and this film grabs you and doesn't let go-full of twists and action start to finish",positive
"I fell asleep, but that's not really because of the movie, but still not a great sign",negative
"Don't care wot others say, I loved and adored everything this film had. Daniel Craig is hotness personified.",positive
awesome for bond freaks,positive
Its bond with a more realistic HANDS ON approach. Save the world or save the girl is back (can't have it both ways no can't we bond?) including a possible long term enemy organizationl like the classics.,positive
"It's Bond, hes Blond?",negative
Now this is what bond should have been like right from the beginning. Still love Connery and Brosnan as Bond but the toughness of Daniel Craig's Bond is spot on for an assassin/spy.,positive
Best Bond movie ever! Finnally that's the real man and not a pussy...,positive
"This was a really solid movie. Good acting, pretty decent writing, and some good action. It wasn't amazing, but it was more than I expected from a bond movie. What I loved the most about this movie is what they did with Bond's character. They really brought the character down to earth and made him much more real. Great stuff. 1",positive
"Sorry, I dont like Poker, least of all spending most of this film watching someone else playing it...BORING",negative
"Bond is back. After Die Another Day, I was all set to hand in my James Bond card but then they finally did Casino Royale. Never have I seen a Bond film or actor so closely portray the James Bond persona in the novels. He's harder than most realize from watching the movies and his cold sarcasm is much more on que. People squawked about casting Daniel Craig as James Bond but ya don't hear em complaining anymore. Perhaps it's because they finally had a novel to work with. Now that they're back to working from scratch, I fear the movies will turn crappy again. Nevertheless, Casino Royale brought Bond back on top. Definitely in my top five for Bond flicks",positive
Fewer gadgets and other changes make this film a striking departure from others in the series...but this 21st Bond film is definitely among the best 007 films.,positive
"You dont need to be a James Bond fan to like this, top class, best bond movie yet",positive
"Taking a cue from the Bourne trilogy of movies, the Bond franchise has taken a decided turn towards a grittier, more vulnerable, less perfect, more human, and altogether more engaging re-imagining of Bond. Even my wife (who hated 007 movies) enjoyed this one. Looking forward to seeing more movies with this new Bond.",positive
"Dare I say it? I'll give him another movie before making any calls, but Daniel Craig may be the best Bond ever.",positive
in my opinion best bond yet,positive
"easily top 5 bond movies ever fantastic, outside of the 19 different endings this movie is flawless",positive
"In my opinion, this is the best Bond movie, because we finally could see a REAL James Bond.",positive
"Not your traditional Bond flick, but given the direction the last few were heading, that's a good thing. Damn good.",positive
"This is the way the Bonds series needed to go. I liked Brosnan alright (especially Goldeneye), but the Bond series was getting more and more ridiculous. Daniel Craig turned out to be an excellent choice.",positive
"Best Bond movie yet... Complex, thought-provoking message and terrific balance of action and drama, without too much fluff. Daniel Craig is, in my opinion, the best Bond yet.",positive
"Look - it's James Bond. He does improbable stunts, has obscene luck with cards and nails two to four women, all within a (roughly) two hour time frame. What's not to like? Lots of explosions, lots of intrigue. This is off of Ian Fleming's first James Bond adventure, adapted and brought into 2007 from the 1950's Cold War setting. I like the little touches - like Bond making stupid rookie mistakes, and the score NOT playing the real ""James Bond Theme"" until the end of the movie, when he fully takes the reigns as 007. Lots of fun, and a good way to spend time.",positive
"The best James Bond since Connery. Saw it in the theater, bought it when it came out on DVD. Awesome flick!",positive
"While not as dapper as Dalton, Daniel Craig does the Bond role well, gives it a nice rebirth after that last guy..Dantes Peak! The only thing it lacked was Q, but this being the most ""realistic"" Bond I've seen, I think having Q and a bunch of ridiculous gadgets might have taken away from that ""realism""...",positive
"7.0 The portrayal of James Bond in this film breaks with previous characterizations. This Bond morphs into a less debonair and tougher sort, even ruthless. The success of the Borne films and perhaps the Mission Impossible films have likely had some influence on this latest portrayal. Daniel Craig is engaging in this role and is very Steve McQueen- like. I think we are ready for this updated version. The story itself also veers a bit from the traditional Bond of old with far fewer car chase scenes, the obvious absence of the beloved Bond toys and the notable lack of a super villian. Just a rough and tumble spy story with some flaws in the plot but it is entertaining enough. Judi Dench gives her usual enjoyable performance and M. Mads Mixkelsen is villianous enough in his role. Eva Green makes for a good but unusual Bond girl as Vesper Lynd in that she does not portray the usual Bond sex pot. I believe that Bonds affair with Vesper may be a manifestation of the chemistry that Bond had with Miss Moneypenny in all of the old Bond films. Moneypenny was a staffer at MI6 (this was the basis of the first Austin Powers Film - Elizabeth Hurley played Moneypenny""Âs daughter). In fact, when Vesper Lynd sits down with him for the first time on the train she says ""I am the money"" to which he replies ""Worth every penny."" Get it? . She can'Ât be the normal sexpot Bond girl because she is a MI6 staffer. Normally there are two or three Bond girls in each film and usually they are agents or girl friends or wives to the enemy. In Casino Royale, the more traditional roles are played by Caterina Murino as Solange (wife of Alexis Demetrios, the first villain) and then Ivana Milicevik as Velenka (girl friend of Le Chiffre, the second villain). I think these two fit the role of the traditional Bond girl well. The writers chose to emphasize the affair with the staffer, no doubt to bring out Bond'Âs softer side as it would have been even less credible if he fell for the enemy. In doing so, the writers had to sacrifice the normal interludes with the babes of the villians.",negative
Thought he would be crap but best bond movie yet,positive
Likte den kjempe godt! spennande og overaskande. Daniel Craig va super sexy og tolka bond rollen bra:),positive
I am a true Bond fan - and this is exactly the way that the franchise needed to go!,positive
good good. daniel craig is a pretty good Bond.,positive
Que bueno que volvieron al estilo los clasicos de James Bond.,positive
"Gritty, Cool, this movie just rocks. Cannot wait for the next one. Very glad that I own this movie :)",positive
"My favourite Bond movie, and at the moment my favourite Bond! Craig is superb, Green was great and the action was brilliant! Also the score was superb as well!",positive
"Best Bond movie ever. Closest to real life, and looks awesome on Blue Ray...",positive
"I'm a Pierce Brosnan fan but this is a really good film, with or without the James Bond status.",positive
One of my favorite Bond films. The acting was excellent as was the action. Daniel Craig is an awesome 007.,positive
reilusti parempi bondi ku ykskÃ¤Ã¤n connery tms paska!,positive
MUCH to my surprise - the blond Bond is the best. Daniel Craig was perfection (I don't believe anyone has ever looked better in a tux).,positive
"Great movie, I like it, a modern version of the novel it was based on. Great movie.",positive
What's all the fuss about? Jason Bourne is the 21st C spy of choice and this is just a pale imitation of the Bourne franchise. Eva Green is easy on the eye though.,negative
Surprisingly better than I expected...hmm...,negative
Not a huge Bond fan...apart from the catchphrases...but this was great...and Daniel Craig's abs weren't bad either..,negative
Best Bond since Russia with Love.,positive
excellent bond movie,negative
Daniel Craig gets this a 5 star rating!,positive
The darkest and grittiest Bond film so far. Well worth watching.,positive
"This may be the Best James Bond moive. Very exciting, bond actually looks vulnerable in this film at times, even loses at cards at one point. While he still kicks behind he actually seems very human in this film which may be the main reason I think its the best.",positive
"My favorite film of 2006, and one of my top 10",positive
"I'm a huge fan of Bond, but was terribly disappointed when I saw Die another day. But this brings back my hopes for the future for 007. This is to me the best Bond since Octopussy. Craig is great as a Connery type of Bond and the other parts are well casted. More more more!",positive
This did for the old Bond movies was Batman Begins did for the old Batman movies. It makes you realize how shitty the old ones were.,positive
"Not quite the worst, far from the best. Daniel Craig isn't well enough endowed to be James Bond.",negative
He didnt look like James Bond should...,negative
So far the only Bond I actually enjoyed watching without getting bored.,negative
"We have a new James Bond, he is going to be good. Can't wait to see more.",positive
"I watched Casino Royale fully expecting to like it. I had heard such good things that I thought it must be a good film. Unfortunately, this just isn't so. Not only is it not a very good film, it's not even a good James Bond film. By saying it's not a good James Bond film, I mean that this Casino Royale does not have all of the series trademarks (the drink, the gadgets, the action, etc.). In rebooting the series, they didn't need to remove everything that made the series James Bond. They needed to rework it to make James Bond work in a different and, hopefully, better way. Even still, removing many of the James Bond elements could leave the film with hope for a level of forgiveness if it amounted to a truly excellent film. After all, Batman Begins removed so much of what was necessary to Batman and it was still an exceptional action film (separate from supposedly being about Batman). Casino Royale, however, can claim no such thing. First off, the action is too minimal for the film to truly be considered an action movie. Second, the tone is just messy. James Bond should have a healthy blend of action, drama, humor, and romance, but the integration must be seamless. In Casino Royale, it's just choppy. At one point, it's a chase film; the next, a laughable character drama; the next, an uncomfortably bad romantic comedy. And, at more than a few points, it divulges into soft-core homo-erotica. This brings me to my third point about why it isn't so good: at times, it's a snuff film. Although this too is a prime example of the jarringly inconsistent tone, it is just a painfully obvious attempt to appeal to every sort of person that would want to see Daniel Craig naked. I imagine the thought process behind the development of the scene went something like this: ""Okay, so, we already have him almost naked at the beach, walking in slow-mo in speedos... we have him naked in bed and in a sex scene... hmm... I know! We could torture him... naked."" It's clear that director Martin Campbell has a man-crush on Craig. All of that said, the cast is mostly good. Daniel Craig, when he's dressed appropriately, is a pretty good James Bond, though not as good as most of the men who've played the character in the past... and, at times, he makes a monkey-face. (I don't mean to say that he looks like a monkey, but, rather, that he makes faces that resemble that of a monkey.) Eva Green is good enough as the stock love-interest-who-betrays-Bond-at-the-end-of-the-film. (If you haven't seen the film, don't worry. I didn't give anything away. It's painfully obvious from the first time you see her. Add to that the fact that the pretty girl almost always betrays Bond.) Mads Mikkelsen is a good villain. (Mostly because you can tell he's bad before he even says anything. You just look at him and think, ""Oh, snap, that man is up to no good."") And Dame Judi Dench turns in one of her best performances as M yet. (M is easily the most interesting part of the film because Dench owns the part and has excellent chemistry with Craig. Furthermore, we're lead to believe that Bond is a badass, but, whenever M's around, we all know that she could have him killed in less than a minute.) Also, the pacing of the film, though horribly slow, is decent if you consider the poor editing and choppy tone of the film. Casino Royale is an example of hype overpowering quality. The film is overlong, mildly pretentious, and horribly inconsistent. If you want to watch a quality Bond film (or at least one better than Casino Royale), watch nearly any of the Connery Bond films or watch Pierce Brosnan in Goldeneye. Being far less dramatically ambitious, those films are allowed to succeed where Casino Royale fails miserably.",negative
finally sean has competition,positive
"Asolutely fantastic film, just what the series was crying out for, a fresh, gritty new take on the franchise. Daniel Craig had his critics before this film (me included) but I am happy to eat my words, he is awesome as 007. Role on Bond 22.",positive
James Bond toimii aina,negative
"Gorgeous Bond film, a must own...",positive
First decent Bond film in years. Bravo.,positive
Tough to replace Sean Connery (despite attempts to do so!) but Daniel Craig hits the mark. A great film.,positive
Finally a 007 movie that represent what James Bond should really be. SEE IT NOW !,positive
Not a big bond fan but thought this film was really good... Craig played Bond Well.,negative
this is my fav movie,positive
"a very special ""james bond"" movie...no happy ending! surprise!",negative
"A real James Bond, not bulletproof like the last 20 films and as much as i like Pierce Brosnan, Craig was immense!",positive
Alkuanimaation vuoksi annan noinkin paljon tÃ¤htiÃ¤.,negative
awesome! best bond ever!,positive
"Now this just rocks. A sharp, dark and gritty action flick with an opening chase that would have had even Matthew Reilly blown away. the best Bond flick I've seen",positive
"The Blonde Bond did it good. A cracking start (Yay for Parkour!), before going new-school Bond with fast cars, sexy women, and plenty of one-liners. Oh, and Dame Judi's great references to the Cold War.",positive
A great movie. Daniel Craig jus fits in the role for Bond. The movie had great scenes and the Brioni suits worn by Daniel are jus awesome. Bring on the Bond 22!!!,positive
Much closer to the 007 of the books and less about the gadgets,positive
Cut Daniel some slack- He did a great job. Throughly enjoyed it. Not to mention went to watch it with some great friends,positive
He had a defibrillator in his glove compartment.,negative
"best bond movie ever, finally Bond act's how he is supposed to",positive
"Worst Bond movie ! Other than the slick fighting moves, nth else to look fwd to. No handsome Bond or pretty Bond girl or hi-tech Bond gadgets/cars. I certainly miss Pierce Brosnan !",negative
Best Bond ever. Also one of the best action films ever.,positive
this movie was perfect because it shows that bond is just another guy and doesn't always do everything perfectly.,positive
I am a James Bond lover and I am impressed by the new Bond. He is great and I hear he acts too.,positive
"This film is very entertaining with great action sequences. Daniel Craig is the toughest and roughest Bond of all the James Bond characters. At the same time he's also smooth, and he can stand on his own ground after a tough fight. Very realistic. He learns his very important lesson : Trust no one. Awesome!!!",positive
I can watch this movie forever.. =D Okay.. maybe not forever but it was AWESOME! LOVE BOND!,positive
"I'm in Love with this movie, in my top 5, Daniel Craig is amazing in this role!",positive
"Daniel Craig does it best, the thinking man's Bond!",positive
nasty torture scene...,positive
Daniel Craig is lame as a Bond! Move over...,negative
"kickass movie, this guy actually makes a good Bond",positive
Daniel Craig is a beautiful Bond! This is a great story and straight up Bond-porn...yummy!,positive
"He's cold, he's hot. Its the best since Sean Connery. Lots of action. Who doesn't love M.",negative
"Daniel Craig is just not a gentleman 007, which makes him doesn't really fit the character. I don't know... I might need to watch this movie again, but I hated it when I first watched it.",negative
"great james bond movie. it has a different feel from most of the others, a bit darker. fantastic.",positive
"Daniel Craig is a brilliant looking Bond, but the film lacked any real structure. The characters were hollow, the story was dull, and the subsequent conclusion was largely unfulfilling.",negative
Very entertaining James Bond film. Almost as good as some of the originals. My only beef is no sweet gadgets or Q.,positive
Best Bond movie ever.,positive
Easily the best Bond movie since Goldeneye.,positive
Above average reboot for the franchise.,negative
"Bond with a cutting edge, doubters slienced. Craig does justice to Fleming's creation. No camp or comic moments, just a Bond that is tough, gets hurt both physically and emotionally, backed with a strong story line. Put Brosnan's efforts to shame.",positive
better than all the other bond movies,negative
Awesome and very funny! Daniel Craig is by far the best Bond there is!,positive
"not quite as good as Goldeneye, but it definitely gets the series back on the right track",positive
"Craig has a contract for at least two more films, so better get used to him.",positive
"Finally, a Bond that is genuinely good and not formulaic! I hope Craig stays with the role for a while.",positive
"I was dubious hearing they were rebooting the series & of Craig as bond but when i saw this i changed my mind. DIfferent from the other films in the series which i like, a breath of fresh air compared to the last few dire brosnan films. A bit long winded tho!",positive
enjoyed this more than the brosnan bonds,positive
Daniel Craig resurrected bond!,positive
my Favourite James Bond movie. HOT HOT,positive
"Agent 007 becomes Agent 007 in a rehash of writer Ian Fleming's very first novel about the secret agent. Slightly updated to modern times (Hold Em), first timer Daniel Craig brings a much needed realism and punch back to the character that had been missing in recent films. The dialogue is superb, Eva Green is breathtaking as Vesper Lynn and the 15min opening chase scene is the most adrenaline fueled Bond scene of all time.",positive
Enh. Unlike any Bond movie before it. But a major bore.,negative
I was pleasantly surprised. Even without David Niven.,positive
watch out for the chair with no bottom,positive
"Best bond ever!!!! Got in on Blu-ray, it looks amazing.",positive
was pleasently surprised at daniel craigs performance. he is definatly not a typical bond. there was none of the smootheness and 1 liners. and not much of the comedy. this film is very enjoyable and it bring a touch of grittyness to the bond franchise. he is definatly me second best bond (after shawn ofc),negative
The best James Bond ever!,positive
I want my Sean Connery back,negative
He makes a shitty James Bond.,negative
"The best movie in the series, Daniel Craig is fantastic.",positive
It gets better everytime you watch it.,positive
"Les cascades spÃ©ctaculaire, l'acteur gÃ©niale ( digne du titre 007 ), le base jumping mongolement hot .... mais l'histoire ... oÃ¹ est Bond ... oÃ¹ sont ses gadjets cool .....",negative
The best james bond movie ever!,positive
Nice movie plenty of action.,positive
It went back to the basics,positive
"I hate James Bond, but finally here's a movie without lame-o gadgets and fantastical plots. I really liked it.",positive
the best bond to date looking forward to the next,positive
soooo good. i never actualyl expected much from him but it was reallly really good!,positive
Uber cool tailored suave bloke in an Aston.. what more can you want ?,positive
"Good movie, Good Bond. Lacked a good character structure. Didn't have the same feeling to it that Bond fans come to expect.",negative
Nooit a moffie James Bond! I like the psycho sex maniacs from the past.,negative
"lol we ad 2 do an essay on this 4 english, it caused me stress! other than that a wer luvin it!",positive
The first James Bond film i have loved and Daniel Craig is very sexy. good film,positive
"Daniel Craig is a brilliant looking Bond, adding some 'edge' and 'raw' steel, but the film lacked any real structure or depth. The characters were hollow, the story was dull, and the subsequent conclusion was largely unfulfilling. Something appeared to be missing - in particular, 'the magic' a Bond film has always contained. Tried too much to be like the 'Bourne Identity' instead of what it was. What was left was a stylish, but bland, return for the Bond franchise.",negative
Long yet very action/suspense packed movie,positive
Un des meilleurs films de 007. Avec un style difÃ©rent des films qui mettait Pierce Brosnan en edette et il Ã©tait temps.,positive
great plot and full of action!,positive
It's the James Bond Movie that show more on punch and fighting comparing to others that focus of high Technology gadget!!,positive
Bond kicks ass and pulls more hot tail could you ask for anything more.,positive
a Must see bond movie no matter what they say about the bonds one of my favorites really must see!!!,positive
good begining to the craig era. question is will the next one be as good???? The answer is...............not quite,negative
"Bond is back, and hes getting better",positive
"if you are expecting the ""usual"" bond you will be disappointed, but this new and wolnerable character is just what the bond theme needs. daniel craig does an amazing job! pretty cool poker hand takes place, though I doubt cards like that will ever be dealt in the same hand ;) eva green is beautiful!",positive
"For saving the James Bond franchise, Daniel Criag deserves to be the next 007 eventhough he is blonde. He makes 007 more real than a gadget spy.",negative
"Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery, as he typifies wht Fleming wrote, that is a hard assed cold killing machine. It is a cracking film, and just when you think it has ended, bam he get tortured. Highly recommended.",positive
Daniel Craig makes it all worth your while :) :),positive
"Daniel Craig IS Bond. After the first two Bourne movies, Bond had a lot to live up to (after the embarassing Die Another Day), but this is a triumph. It's a bit long, but the story, characters and action make the time zip by. Eva Green isn't just a 'Bond Girl' - she's an intelligent, well rounded character (who just happens to be sexy!) Even the theme tune is growing on me!",positive
"Very good film, excellent plot and filled with action. Cant wait for the next one!",positive
WOW!! What more can I say? Was a massive Pierce Brosnan fan but now - DANIEL CRAIG! What a performance! WOW!!,positive
Should be a 5star for Daniel's body,negative
"For me, it's the best Bond film so far. Gone are the cheesy lines of dialogue. Gone are the over the top gadgets. Here we have a Bond that is real. He gets his hands dirty to get the job done. It was action packed with fight scenes, parkour, and a cool car crash. Lets hope the next one is just as good.",positive
Wasn't too sure with Daniel Craig in the lead role but he didn't disappoint in a much darker Bond!!,positive
A really good film...just not a Bond film.,positive
really cool start for the whole james-bond-saga...,positive
"Bond's back with an attitude, and some sponsors.",positive
"Daniel Craig is possibly one of the best (and most realistic anyway!!) Bonds! Great movie, I loved every minute of it.",positive
"Back to real MI5 ""licenced to kill"" agent"" from some ""soft"" characters with many gadgets""",positive
I became a Daniel Craig fan as soon as I saw his eyes in this movie... And the movie itself is pretty great!,positive
"Yo, I didn't expect to like this movie, because I think James Bond films are generally lame. But this movie was sick. Action-packed, devoid of the typical weak cast. The plot was actually intriguing. Four stars!",positive
"Differs from all other 007 movies, good acting",negative
"Bond is back in style! Craig is arguably the most human and realistic of all, perhaps the perfect opposite of Roger Moore. Excellent début.",positive
Best Bond movie I've ever seen.,positive
Very intense Bond movie. I didn't expect to be that good because of the introduction of the new Bond.,positive
"who doesn't like a spy with a tux, aston martin, and all the fun gadgets",positive
"Fantastic, My Favorite Bond to date. This Bond was gritty and I hate to use the word real to describe a super spy who trots the world foiling bad guys but that is what popped into my head. It's nice to see Bond strangle a guy in a bathroom once in a while.",positive
I didn't think I was going to like Daniel Craig but his cocky attitude is just what 007 needed. The poker game drags on a little for me but the car crash was the coolest thing I have seen whether it's realistic or not.,positive
"Daniel Craig is surprisingly very, very good and a refreshing change from Pierce Brosnan. The first sequence in the movie is spectacular and the entire movie is very well done.",positive
i love all of the 007 movies but this one didn't live up to my expectations. it was very disappointing.,negative
"The torture scene was painful to watch...like kicked in the nuts painful. Wait. Anyway, it was a great action flick :)",positive
best bond movie to date,positive
"Best Bond film I've seen. This guy is great. The plot is great... but what i love most of all is the character devlopment. Seeing Bond become who he is WOW. Not like others at all. Oh man, check out that car! The car chase is gonna be sweet! Look, he's getting in, it's gonna be great! He's driving, this is--- HOLY SHIT, WTF!! bam, he's knocked out.",positive
This is my favorite Bond so far! And favorite Bond girl! Finally got some sass!,positive
"Return to form for the franchise but the ball-battering scene was a bit silly and the last half hour sucked ass(great final scene,though)",negative
"Was pretty good, appreciated Daniel Craig's grittyness.",negative
The new Bond prevails! looking forward the following ones!,negative
Craig is a fantastic gritty Bond. The parkour sequence at the beginning of the movie was unbelievable.,positive
"Finally, a Bond that actually looks like a killer, cold and calculating. This is 007 for the 21st century.",positive
"Great reboot that reinvents Bond (or rather, takes him back to his literary roots), although I could have done without the unnecessary (albeit action-packed) first half. I will miss the ridiculous gadgets, absurd villain plots, and cheesy Bond quips, though!",positive
"Best bond flick, arguably the best bond (sorry Sir Sean)",positive
"The first Bond movie that I've bothered buying on DVD (and watching more than once for that matter), It has a good story and great acting from Daniel Craig; who ended up being my favorite Bond, Eva Green was great and so was Giancarlo Gianni.",positive
For anyone who has not seen this movie - Daniel Craig has brought a new dimension to the role of Bond. Rougher cut. Not at all like Moore or Dalton - He is what Brosnon wanted to be. Closest Bond to Connery's yet. Long may his Bond reign continue. My favourite movie of 2006,positive
"I love this movie. I ignore the fact that there's no continuity with the actors in this one and historical films, and the fact that this movie is James Bonds first movie as a 007, yet the references are to 9/11 and modern times, not the 70s. Still an awesome movie. I definately want to bone 5 chicks at once after seeing this movie...",positive
It's actually really good!,positive
"True masterpiece, loved every scene, lots of great action! Easily a 5 of 5",positive
An extended advert for Sony that appears to go on for about 30 years.,negative
I wish every Bond film was as good as this!,positive
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Craig rocked my world.,positive
"I must confess, I was sceptical of this movie at first. However, having watched it, I must say it ranks as one of the top Bond films ever made, with brilliant perfomances, a compelling storyline, and a distinct lack of villains with cheesy gimmicks ;) My only two gripes with the movie are: 1) Judi Dench. As usual, she gives an excellent performance - however, being the stickler for continuity I am, I would have preferred to see an old male M. Nothing against Judi Dench - she's a great actress - I'm just a bit obsessed with continuity :) 2) At the airport, when the fuel tanker drives through the bus, why is it the bus that explodes!? The tanker is carrying goodness-knows how much flammable, explosive liquid, while the bus has people in. From a purely realistic, physical point of view, it makes no sense. Anyway, those two very minor points aside, this is a tremendous film I would highly recommend. I'm already looking forward to seeing Craig in another Bond film :)",positive
"The best bond since Connery but not better than. This guy is cold, he's a killer and he's got class without being too smarmy like Brosnan, Moore and Lazenby. Best Bond ending EVER!!!",negative
Say what you want...this blond Bond so works for me :),positive
"Back to classic Bond, just like I want them.",negative
Bond. James Bond. I think this is Bond at his greatest since the days of Sean Connery. You can't consider yourself a fan of Bond without seeing this movie.,positive
I didnt think Daniel Craig would ever be good enough to be Bond and thought this film was going to be an embarrassment. I have never been so wrong! Absolutely by far the best bond film and one of the best films I've seen in a while!,positive
"The best James Bond movie I can think of, even when considering Sean Connery's JB collection. Maybe it's the reduced emphasis on stunts and gadgets, maybe it's the vulnerable side to Bond that comes out (instead of him just being just a robotic, martini-drinking, government hitman), but in my mind, Daniel Craig is the best Bond so far.",positive
Bond is most definetly back on form. What a breath of fresh air after the rubbish CGI disapointment that was Die Another Day.,positive
Daniel Craig is great as James Bond - At last a Bond who can act.,positive
Best bond movie for years.,positive
If they keep this up... Bond will be around for a while... One of the best in this series in forever.,positive
I haven't seen that many bond movies so I don't have much to base it on but I thought it was pretty cool,negative
Had me on the edge of my seat,positive
best James Bond movie by far!!!!,positive
"definatly the best Bond movie since golden eye. daniel craig does a good job, but i just don't see him as james Bond, still a very good moive.",positive
Excellent entertainment.,positive
"Fantastic! Slick, sexy, action-pakced and intelligent! A perfect action/thriller- A perfect Bond film. Plus Daniel Craig is just pure class.",positive
"Just brilliant, it makes those pathetic product placed last few look so shabby, they are in the right direction now!",positive
"The best Bond Film. If you wish to contend, then all I can say is you're an idiot. This is how Bond is supposed to be, slick, cold, and a bad ass.",positive
"Amazing film, daniel craig is proper hot <3",positive
craig could be next connery?,positive
"Daniel Craig is the best actor suited to Bond character so far. Tough, crude and rude. Ian Flemming would choose him I guess...",positive
"Wish I was more of a bond fan so I could say some really great things about this movie compared to the rest, but since im not I can only say this movie is great. Really cool action scenes and exciting to watch. The movie is done very well and its fun to watch!",positive
"BÃ¤sta Bond rullen nÃ¥gonsin, fÃ¥r ont i pungen bara jag tÃ¤nker pÃ¥ filmen..",positive
Best Bond movie I've seen! Craig delivered a great performance by making the role his own.,positive
no gadgets no main baddy didnt feel like a bond film,negative
Best 'new' Bond movie by far! Much more realistic and gritty,positive
I don't get this movie. Seriously.,negative
"The best Bond film by far in my mind, gone with the silliness, back with the ruthless Bond from the early films",positive
ma ma dei la... daniel craig looks too old to be Bond la,negative
"a James Bond without gatgets, What's that???dissapointed..",negative
very good action and the editeing was very good too.i think daniel craig is the best bond after the legendary sean conrey,positive
The best Bond because the protagonist has more in common with the flesh-and-blood Jason Bourne than any of the superhuman Bond's in the franchise's history.,positive
Great casting for Daniel Craig as James Bond!! One of the best bond ever.,negative
"DC plays the best Bond since Connery. Great to see the writers move away from the usual OTT stunts and effects of previous outings. A Bond with substance, feelings and flaws, the way Flemming intended him to be.",positive
Phwoar For an Older man :],positive
"maybe I went into it with a bad attitude, but I can't be that far off. The plot was weak and the card game was slow. It seems like the people who like it only like it in comparison to other Bond movies. Those must be really bad. Maybe that's why I have never been able to sit through a whole viewing.",negative
"The first Bond film worth seeing since ""The Living Daylights"", 20 years ago. Craig is excellent and Eva Green's Bond Girl is, for once, a 3-dimensional character. If I had to split hairs I'd say this was slightly lacking in the villain stakes...",negative
"Daniel Craig is easily the coolest bond to date. It helps that he's remarkable talanted and he had an amazing story to work with. The story shows us how Bond became to be a double 0 and why he becomes the womanizer that he is. Even in a role completely surrounded by action, Craig shows depths in Bond that have previously been unseen. I cannot wait for the next one.",positive
"Not bad, except for too much poker and a boring villain.",negative
Awesome Bond... good work by Daniel Craig,positive
"Much better than I expected. Daniel Craig does a good job of a rough, early Bond.",positive
"Daniel Craig? Yes, please.",positive
Definitely the best bond in a long time. Long live Daniel Craig!,positive
"not bad, Craig does well dispte the worst piece of casting since Troy",negative
Best bond film for a long long time,positive
"Best 007 of all! Gritty, realistic characters, best chase scene, unusual: on foot, fast pace with great story line",positive
"Surprisingly good Bond movie. Finally humanized James Bond enough so you actually believe he makes mistakes and can actually bleed. But Daniel Craig just can't pull it off as Bond...he looks like a blond dwarf on steriods. BUT, i've always been a fan of Eva Green so that makes up for it.",negative
The best Bond movie since Connery was Bond. Yay!,positive
Go Daniel Craig... what a good film!,positive
An artisticly different take on the old Bond style of movie. Great Stuff.,positive
Definitely my favorite Bond Movie to date.,positive
Definately one of my favourite Bond flicks. I personally like Daniel Craig as the new Bond. He has a more severe look to him and looks liek the spy who will charm you but has the deadly enough air about him to kill you without a flinch or a thought. The film itself is a lot of fun as Bond films go.,positive
Best written and best acted Bond film to date. Craig proves himself equal to Connery.,positive
best bond but may not be the best bond movie i have seen,negative
Daniel Craig convinced me that James Bond doesn't need dark hair.,positive
Daniel Craig is did not give Bond it's living character! the movie was below my expectations: it was so predictable!,negative
"I was really worried about Daniel Craig being the next James Bond (I was really hoping for Hugh Jackman). Turns out I had nothing to worry about it! Daniel Craig has all the appeal a James Bond needs, and I'm excited to see him in the next one!!",positive
"Casino Royale is one of the best Bond movies: The intro with free-runner Foucan is one of the best Bond intros, Craig is one of the best Bond actors, Mikkelsen is one of the best Bond bad guys, and Green is one of the best Bond babes. One problem though, the poker game, which is a boring or even irritating part for us that are dead tired of everyone playing poker all the time.",positive
the new bond is very well cast.,positive
Consider me a cool aid drinker. Best. Bond. Ever. (Including Connery.),positive
BEST BOND MOVIE I'VE SEEN!,positive
"3 part Gordons, 1 part Vodka,1/2 Lillet, Shaken not stirred",positive
"a lot better than i thought it'd be. Still an over-the-top action flick with one too many Bond-in-a-Speedo shots, but hey, compared to the last couple of Pierce 007 flicks, it really kicks some ass.",negative
Never been a James Bond fan - LOVE this one. The first Bond that actually feels like a man and not a gigolo.,positive
"One of the better Bond movies since Connery, but not quite as amazing as everyone makes it out to be. Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond and I look forward to the next installment",positive
Daniel Craig is even better than Pierce and Sean,positive
"daniel craig is by far my favorite bond. his smooth, easy charm had me at the opening scene. like the previous bond movies, this one is not lacking in action. the scenes were positively thrilling and had me at the edge of my seat. there were several stunts that had me holding my breath, which were executed fabulously. this movie will not disappoint you.",positive
I liked it. Daniel Craid > Pierce Brosnan,positive
Best Bond movie since The World is Not Enough,positive
The Best movie ever! just watch it.,positive
"Okay, seriously, this movie sucked. If you're pursuing someone on foot, why chase them up a construction site? THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME DOWN! JUST WAIT! YOU'RE A SPY, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT!",negative
plot can get a little convoluted at times but overall a good film with good action sequences.,positive
I AM A JAMES BOND FREAK!!!,positive
"Eva Green is incredibly hot; plus, Daniel Craig totally runs through a wall.",negative
"best bond fim to date. not so polished you can see the cheese shine, dan makes bond more real. well done",positive
i watched half of it thinking it was a jason borne movie,negative
"The best Bond movie I have ever seen- puts all others to shame. Daniel Craig is an actual tough Bond, not like the wimpy Pierce Brosnan.",positive
This is an overdue update on Bond. The Bond series was getting fairly bland. This movie redeemed Bond as a bad ass.,positive
"WORST bond movie ever. SUPPOSEDLY set BEFORE all the others, but is set in 2006, completley idiotic!",negative
"James bond movies have sucked ever since goldeneye, This movie returned James Bond to a level of greatness.",negative
One of the best James Bond's yet!,negative
"amazing, probaly the best one",positive
My favourite bond film. And Daniel Craig is now my favourite Bond.,positive
What a great debut! A really good change on normal Bond movies too - a lot more besides the raw action!,positive
"One of, if not the best Bond films ever",positive
"Bond is a ruthless git, yay!",positive
Daniel Craig is an Amazing Bond - A great film!,positive
"Not as interesting as I expected it to be, but Daniel Craig as Bond is lots of fun.",negative
"Just the best of the franchise. The story at last has got some meat to it and there is less silliness, even if the product placement grates too much.",positive
"00 7 is back. Blonder bigger and better than before. Yes I will admit that I was scared at first as every body else was of the lead star Daniel Craig taking over the James bond role . he was blond they said he was to smale peopled screamed that he hade blue eyes . Many thing here said about him but one thing is for sure he did not resemble the other actors. I did not now what to expect of him but one thing is for sure is that what ever I thought than now I now that Mr. Craig is perfect was not only perfect for this role he was talented and was better than any bond actor to have ever plaid the role. Not only that he bring life to this character but he broth the character back the bond that was in the books (THE DARK AND Mysterious AGENT THAT FLEMING CREATHED and NOT THIS funny LIKE sarcastic bond like MOORE AND BROOSMAN PLAYED IT.) Casino royale . The story: After receiving license to kill from the MI-6, the secret agent James Bond follows his leads and avoids the destruction of the greatest airplane in the world in Miami plotted by the evil banker Le Chiffre to crash the bonds in the stock market and break the air flight company. The banker loses the funds of international terrorist organizations and organizes a poker game in Casino Royale, in Montenegro, to raise the money of the investors. James Bond travels with the British accountant Vesper Lynd to bet and defeat La Chiffre and force him to look for protection with the MI-6, disclosing the names of the terrorists. James wins, but is double-crossed, in a game of betrayals and murder. I as a fan loved it and it is in my top ten of movie of all time in joy it and have fun. You will not regret it I promise.",positive
"While I was a bit skeptical at first, I do have to admit I think it is the best Bond movie to date.",positive
The only problem with this movie is that fact that it isn't the same guy! Its crap without the guy.,negative
"There is one reason and one reason only i watch this film, time an time again.... daniel craig.",positive
"Very good movie (also because there are two italian actors :-), especially the second part.Great performance from Daniel Craig, the first James Bond with blue eyes and blond hair.",negative
"Yum, yum!! Good acting & storyline too - the first Bond movie I actually enjoyed",positive
Best Bond movie of all time,positive
Better than any of the modern Dalton/Brosnan bonds.,positive
After Goldfinger the second best Bond ever!,positive
"So I enter the cinema ready to watch a James Bond movie and then this creep pops up the screen. The guy doesn't even remotely look like a 007. Judging from the pink panther cameo, I think CLIVE OWEN could have done a much better job. Daniel Craig will have to prove himself in the next Bond movie, all the best buddy!",negative
"Pretty good James Bond movie. They did a great job restarting the movie series. I missed all the gadgets though. Daniel Craig brings a more tough and darker James Bond to the movie, he does a good job. -James Bond: [laughing - after being stuck five times with a knotted rope] Now the whole world's gonna know that you died scratching my balls!",negative
Great Bond Movie.. Daniel Craig played a new refreshing bond in this film even though the media felt that he would not compare to previous Pierce Brosnan.. I kinda liked the new style he protrayed to the film and made the character feel more realistic. I cant wait until the next film,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Conery. And this movie was way better than the last three Bond movies with Pierce Brosnon whoes only good 007 movie was Goldeneye.,positive
I'm looking forward to the Daniel Craig era.,positive
Best Bond yet. I can't wait for the next one.,positive
"daniel craig does a decent job as the the new 007, but i like pierce brosnan better. casino royale lacks the explosive action we've all come to expect from a james bond movie. i actually enjoyed the poker tournament more than the action scenes in this one. mads mikkelsen was a pleasant surprise. at two and a half hours, it was also a little long. it kinda dragged on towards the end.",negative
THE BEST action mowie i have EVEA saw,positive
"Best James Bond, and James Bond movie ever!",negative
http://www.ihad.de/2007/02/18/casino-royale-2006/,positive
Best Bond Film In Years,positive
"I really loved this movie...actually, b4 watching the movie i used to think, they'd pu a butler to play Bond...after hte opening action seqnce of hte movie..all my prev ideas vanished. The action, the concept and the tech shown..made it feel like a truw Bond movie of our era. I'm sayin this cuz in spite of an being an avid Bond watcher, i hater movies like Die Another Day which seemed to belong to a future gen or some alien planet. This one deserves all the eye-balls it's garnered!",positive
Great movie. Great action. Great Bond.,positive
"Action packed, as with any James Bond, full of twists and hot actors",negative
"i thought no one could be worse than roger moore but i was wrong. daniel craig is just so wrong. he is not good looking, lacks charisma & the character he portrayed in casino royale is a disappointment. that's so unlike james bond. gimme PEIRCE BROSNAN or SEAN CONNERY!!!",negative
love all james bond movie,positive
"better than the pierce brosnan bond films, back to basic action, not so overblown and unrealistic. the bad guy was interesting and i like the quick witted one liners - that's what bond films should be like!",negative
A good show .. the making of bond.,positive
"now why would they change the name from ""James Bond"" to ""Casino Royale""? nice movie though",negative
actually the best bond movie ive ever seen. i didnt think i would like it.,positive
"Daniel Craig rocks as the new James Bond, and the styling and mise en scene is perfect. a more convincing andf grittier portrayal of the real James Bond.",positive
"It IS a great movie, and much better than the films have been since Tomorrow Never Dies, but it's let down by an over-long ending that could have been made much shorter and more effective. Other than that, great cast, good gags, impressive Bourne-style brutality and free-running. Good stuff.",negative
the first 15 mins. is ......crazy...,positive
"The 2006 film does not have the same ending as the book. In the book, Bond kills the girl when he finds out she is an double agent. I would prefer to see an even more ruthless, gritty Bond.",positive
As an avid connery fan I never thought i'd say it....... but Daniel Craig could be THE Bond I think. The Movie was more in line with Ian Fleming's character from the books.,positive
"The best Bond Film ever (I m not saying Craig is the best Bond character). Spells Raw and what james Bond should be doing instead of copulating. The opening action scene was simply amazing. Shortie's pretty intense , makes up for his lack of finesse and charm. I think that s why the men like it, cuz he's imperfect and angry, like us.",positive
"Ah! que buena cinta lo mejor que le ha pasado al doble 0 desde Goldeneye para Nintendo 64, finalmente un agente secreto que podemos todos tomarnos en serio",positive
"HelgerÃ¥n att kalla detta fÃ¶r Bond! Inga maskiner, bara en Bond-brud och halva filmen Ã¤r asdryg poker! PALLA!",negative
Before watch: U SUCKS Craig After watch: U are the best bond ever!,positive
"I didn't really like the ending, the girl should have lived!!",negative
"This for me, is the best Bond film ever! Daniel Craig is just delicious and perfect as Bond, James Bond",positive
craig is best bond since roger,positive
"Kind of you love it or you hate it I love it, nice movie",positive
One of the better action oriented Bond movies I've seen.,negative
"Love it. The James Bond before he was James Bond, showing the more human side of and evolution into the legend.",positive
the greatest Bond ever...,positive
The best Bond film ever made. I am figuratively kicking myself for not catching this in the theater.,positive
"the best james bond yet. and that says something considering how many there are. amazingly shot, incredibly acted, and that crazy chase scene at the beginning.... oh my gosh! the only thing is that daniel craig might be too perfect.... then again, maybe not ;-)",positive
"Def one of my favorite movies ever! I thought it was gonna be horrible cuz I love Brosnan, but he doesn't hold a candle to the ""hot"" Daniel Craig",positive
"This was a disappointment. I thought it ended an hour before it actually did. It was humorous in some parts and it didn't even mean to be, but overall, I got bored after awhile and just wanted to go home.",negative
Better than 75% of the Bond movies. And very true to the book.,positive
"A different type of James Bond movie. I enjoyed the story, but I still like older Bond films.",negative
Saw it and wished i had not.,negative
Very entertaining....definitely worth the 2.5 hours,positive
Best bond since Sean Connery. Nice to see a more human Bond.,positive
best bond movie out of all the ones ive seen. hes going to do great,positive
Great! Great! Great! Daniel Craig is the best bond. A real gem of a film!,positive
"sinister, Mr. Craig is the best Bond since Sir Conery",positive
Pretty freakin AWESOME!!! could have been a bit better though,positive
En av de bedre Bondfilmene ever.,positive
Best Bond ever made for sure...Daniel Craig is slick,positive
"And I thought Daniel Craig would be the worst Bond yet. He surpasses Brosnan, Dalton, Lazenby, Moore, and even competes with Connery for the prize. Absolutely brilliant.",positive
I clocked in 40 minutes but then I had to give up. Suxor! Jason Bourne roxxor!,negative
Who could resist this Bond...not me! Less special effects and more gritty than Bond has been for a long time....bring on more Daniel007.,positive
"The only thing I did not like about this movie was Chris Cornell singing the theme song...atrocious. Otherwise this was a stellar movie. Best Bond ever? All signs point to yes, but we will see...",positive
"different class, awesome casting, and its actually believable",positive
let the good times roll,positive
daniel craig did a good job,positive
"Great movie, i don't like how it only takes place in a few places, and some parts were so stupid i actually laughed, (ex. girl riding the horse on the beech). good movie though",positive
One of my favorite Bond flick! I just like the new harsh and realistic take on the franchise. Great cast too...,positive
Get in!! Best Bond ever!!,positive
Daniel Craig is hot in this movie,positive
Probably the best Bond movie I've ever seen. (I've seen them all.),positive
By far the coolest Bond ever. I now have a man crush on Daniel Craig.,positive
Best James Bond ever,positive
Una perspectiva totalmente diferente del Agente 007 que hasta ahora conociamos. Esta pelicula es el punto de inflexion de 007...tendremos este agente `por muchos aÃ±os. Al principio se dudo de Daniel Craig pero pudo demostrar que encajaba perfecto en el papel,positive
This movie does go on a bit.. but I loved seeing the consequences of a man being screwed over by the woman he loved ultimately turning Mr Bond into a misogynist pig!!,negative
Wonderful Movie. One of the best James Bond movie. Currently i would like to rank it at the top.,positive
"The Bond franchise is back on track - this is the best one since the early Connery days, and closer to the wonderful novels than any of them. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since the Scotsman himself, and the first one that brings his own merit into it rather than serving as a pale copy of Connery.",positive
The hottest Bond ever in the best Bond movie ever. Period. And he's not driving a BMW in this one!,positive
Best Bond since Goldeneye! Daniel Craig was a brilliant choice,positive
"Definitely a Bond movie- reminded me more of the books than the previous movies, which is good. This one definitely raises the bar for the next Bond movie",positive
Daniel Craig has the substance... The best bond...,negative
"Daniel Craig was ""considerably"" underestimated way before the movie was even made. This clever reincarnation of the best spy agent makes him the ultimate James Bond!",positive
"Sorta wierd w/ the whole ""love"" thing. Bond just had to learn the hard way",positive
"Amazingly, this was my first Bond movie and it was great. And as for Mr Craig - Phwoar!",negative
"Movie was great, but dragged a bit at the end..",positive
"Sans condition, un des meilleur James Bond. Il remonte vraiment le niveau des derniers. L'auto dÃ©rision trÃ¨s prÃ©sente est une des piÃ¨ce maitresse de cet excellent film",positive
Bond is nasty...best opening sequence I've seen in ages...shame there wasn't more like this through out,negative
"Best bond movie ever. Good fast paced plot, believable character motivation and a female boss! Oh, and Daniel Craig is sooo..",positive
Two words...Daniel Craig,positive
"The new bond is different , but very welcome change . Dont miss the starting chase !!",negative
Den beste bond filmen siden Goldeneye. Ingen usynlige biler som klarer Ã¥ kjÃ¸re i snÃ¸en uten Ã¥ lage hjulspor i denne filmen :),positive
this was the first time i did not wish sean connery back. my favourite bond movie.,positive
"may be i was in a bad mood when i watched it, but i liked it and thats it",positive
"Brilliant - again have the blu ray and i loved this one, much grittier than your average Bond - highly recommended.",positive
"On dirait que les producteurs ont vu la sÃ©rie des Jason Bourne... et ils sont bien fait. C'es tun trÃ¨s bon James Bond. Daniel Craig est formidable (et pourtant je ne misais pas un centime sur lui), et le film est trÃ¨s bien foutu. Juste une belle longueur pendant la partie de Poker qui n'en finit plus, mais bon...",positive
a bit far fetched in places but come on girls....its Daniel Craig!,positive
"This one gets it all right. Leaden, au courant plot. Good villain, great Bond. Bravo to all involved, especially the electrifying Craig and the producers who took a risk on rebooting their successful franchise.",positive
so much darker and human...,positive
"At first I didn't think that Daniel Craig would make a good Bond, but it ended up being way better than I thought. Good set up. Good movie. Far more realistic than most of the Bond movies, but it's still a fun movie to watch. I really like it. And the song. You know my name. Ya you do.",positive
Quite good movie. Especially liked Mr. Mikkelsens ImsoemoIcryblood-character.,negative
James Bond comes back better than ever,negative
A movie with style!!!,positive
Daniel Craig proves in just one film he's the definitive 007!,positive
"I was never a big bond fan, but if this is what I can come to expect from Daniel Craig, then you count on me seeing the next couple movies in the series. Lots of action; considerably more than any other Bond.",positive
"Awesome 007 movie! I loved it. If you like spy movies I recomend this one, just skip through the torture scene especially if your a guy. OUCH!",positive
"close to, if not, the best Bond Film and actor",positive
Im obsessed with Bond and Daniel Craig is hot hot hottttttttt and if anyone has read the books the way Ian Flemming describes Bonds looks you probably couldnt find anyone who suits the description better than Daniel Craig I love James Bond!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"Easily the best Bond ever, and has the best bum too!",positive
Daniel Craig is sexier than Pierce Broman. That's a plus!,negative
definately my favourite bond movie so far! daniel craig played 007 extremely well...looking forawrd to the next one!,positive
"this is the only bond movie i've ever watched all the way through, probably because it marks a bit of a departure from the usual bond fare.",negative
Best Bond Movie. Daniel Craig kicked ass.,positive
"Who is James Bond? Of course Sean Connery, uh, err, umm, maybe not. Daniel Craig is stunning as Bond. His next movie will settle the argument, either way. The movie also ha a story with substance and the best foot chase scene ever! It actually may be worth buying...",positive
"The best bond film I've ever seen. Martin Campbell grabs the audience like never before in a bond film, undertaking his second newcomer (first was Brosnan in Goldeneye, another great). I knew Daniel Craig would rock ever since seeing Layer Cake.",positive
Bond as he should be. Wow... a bond girl that's actually intelligent (without having to give her a job description that IMPLIES she's intelligent). I still contend that Craig doesn't look like Bond to me but he does a fantastic job. Looking forward to the new batch of Bond films!,positive
my favorite bond movie!,positive
Need I say more? I left PS3 party early to catch this movie at the Chinese Theater on Friday (midnight) with other Bond fans & freaks. Classic!,positive
"Nice, but classic bond!!",positive
"c'est pas dÃ©gueu cette nouvelle mouture de Bond avec un Daniel Craig bien rugueux (qui a des airs de Robert Mitchum). Ã§a envoie du bois comme il faut sans tomber dans des trucs complÃ¨tement n'importe quoi comme avec Pierce Brosnan (c'est pas de sa faute hein), il a toujours la classe, les James Bond girls sont Ã©videmment bien choisies (mais pourquoi sur-maquiller Eva Green qui est juste magnifique au naturel alors qu'elle devient limite ""passable"" avec rouge Ã  lÃ¨vres et far Ã  paupiÃ¨res). on retrouve bien les recettes d'un Bond : le cotÃ© Paic Citron ""quand y en a plus, y en a encore"", les alternances d'action pure et d'affrontements psychologiques (d'ailleurs, Ã§a tue comme nom de mÃ©chant ""Le Chiffre""), le charme, la vodka-Martini (et son invention !), les trahisons, les agents doubles... manque juste les gadgets. on passe un bon moment en tout cas, pas vu trop le temps passer et content du nouveau Bond.",positive
The best Bond flick since the Connery times. Craig rocks.,positive
Was not happy at first when I found out about Daniel Craig but after seeing the movie he is a great dark bond,positive
"Ive got to say - Daniel Craig really plays the role well here, it makes Pierce look rubbish!",positive
"Best Bond by miles. Forgot Connery, Craig was born to be Bond (and he's English). Can't wait for the next ones.",positive
"Who would have thought there'd ever be a hotter bond than Connery? Probably, the best Bond film. I know, it sounds weird, right? But go with it, it's all right, the water's fine!",positive
"This was a wonderful action movie, and the first Bond film I think I completely enjoyed.",negative
ok. Very dark at the beginning. But this 007 caught my heart when he got his heart broken by his new bond girl when she died. Interesting movie but I like the other bond movies better.,negative
"I loved this film. Yes, it was an answer to the ""Bourne"" saga - but what a step up in action. Pure Bond class after the utter tripe of the last couple of films. James Bond is hard, uncompromising, icy, deadly, and human. Nice!",positive
"Yeah.. Bond is not a blonde haired, blue eyed spy. He is a sleek dark haired pimp spy. I know it's supposed to portray a younger more outgoing bond, but don't cast someone who is not fitting to the character at all in appearance. This movie didn't seem like a bond at all to me.",negative
I think he went to the gym a couple of times before filming...,positive
"Fantasic! It's got action, drama, betrayal, and, of course, cars. The most surprising thing about this movie is that it is also a really great love story. As much as I like the classic love stories, they don't even come close to the truth of the heart as this one does. It's got something for everyone and is easily the best Bond movie ever. Can't wait for the next one!",positive
most enjoyable james bond i have ever seen. better story line and much better bond hes hot.,positive
"wow, this did for 007 what Batman Begins did for Batman.",positive
"I thought this was great. Brosnan Era Bond almost ruined it for me, but they stepped up with this one. Good times.",positive
how could you screw up such a good movie in so many different ways? the new Bond is perfect though,negative
"It's different. Not my favorite Bond, not really what I envision as Bond, but it's not a bad movie.",negative
"The best bond movie I've seen. Faithful to the book and cuts out the majority of the cheese that had crept into the series, while still managing to be fun.",positive
one of the best bonds,negative
"Good actor, fit... it's what the Bond films have been crying out for.",positive
"Old Bond is so much better, this movie was so graphic.",negative
I was disappointed when Daniel Craig became the new James Bond. I just couldn't see it. I went to this movie expecting to be bored but it turned out to be one of my all-time favorite Bond movies.,positive
A bloody good reinvention of 007 that gives the franchise a much-needed shot in the arm. It's a bit overlong though; the Venice section at the end of the film is a sequence too far.,positive
Dan Craig classic. A must see. he's so damn sexy.,positive
probably best 007 movie ever.,positive
Have a bit of a crush on Danile Craig now!,positive
Best Bond movie in the last 10 years.,positive
"A much needed reboot of the Bond series (some of the Brosnan films were just insane) The story drags at points, but Daniel Craig makes up for it in spades.",positive
Best Bond film in years.,positive
"Best Bond film since the age of Sean Connery and Roger Moore, minimalism in goofy weapons and gadgets and better story and plot",positive
would have been better if they would have staged it in the past.. say circa 1960's,negative
"Re-invent the franchise? How about explode the ridiculous nature of the last 20 years of Bond, and give the man a soul (tortured at that). I still cried when they rolled the Aston...7 times! Oh the humanity!",positive
ive seem all the james bond films and i dont think tht this one was a good one. the old ones are much better by far. but i still like it he NICE loving the blue eyes!!,negative
Even if he's blond he was a good James Bond,positive
never thot i could be a Bond fan til i saw this! Tho.. i'm still not a Bond fan.. =p,positive
"My favorite bond movie of all time. Bond acts much more like Jack Bauer or Jason Borne, and it helps this movie a lot. It is a much more grungy bond, and less cheesy that the ones the preceded it.",positive
"The bond debate will always rage over who is best, connery, brosnan or now craig. Whats clear is that this latest instalment of Bond borrows much from the style of the Bourne series, grittier, darker and everything the rest of Bond should have been. Craig brings a more brooding harder aspect to Bond and this modern take on Bonds achievement of his ""00"" status is likely to thrill Bond lovers and sceptics alike. (ps check out the fabulous parkour scene in the construction site and mourn the demise of the superb Aston Martin DB9 ... or is that DBS?)",positive
"Although Sean Connery is still the best Bond, and Pierce Brosnan will always be my favorite, I have to admit that this was the greatest James Bond movie I've yet to see! As Kelly Rippa said on an episode of ""Regis and Kelly"" that I happened to be watching while working out (and no, I don't usually watch that show), Daniel Craig reminds me of Steve McQueen.",positive
"Daniel Craig brings Bond to a whole new level. He is a fit, muscled Bond who spends a lot of time on his body. The ending was spectacular.",positive
"They've finally nailed it. No more hammy limp fisted Roger Moore Karate chops or nausea inducing one liners - just the cold, calculating, reptilian psychopath Bond needs to be if he has any chance of succeeding in his said field. Stellar, relentless action sequences, a deliciously ruthless performance by Craig and a heart-pounding finale underneath Venice. Thatâs not to take anything away from the great Scotsman or Andress/Bach â THE ultimate Bond girls â but Casino Royale IS Bondâ¦",positive
"Despite getting some bad reviews for not having enough gadgets in it, this movie rocks! Old school Bond: fist fights, blunt force and wit. Don't need fancy metal things to make a good movie.",positive
"Never loved Bond movies, but this one was quite breath taking. ... and in my opinion Daniel Craig is good-looking, you may disagree ;)",positive
Awesome! Loved it! First 10 minutes are intense!,positive
good action movie but in no way shape or form felt like a bond movie and thats a bad thing,negative
Surprisingly one of the best Bond movies.,positive
Would have been perfect but 20 mins too long,positive
"This was the first Bond film I ever saw, and now I want to see more.",negative
Daniel Craig.. droolll,positive
"i'm sorry that i ever doubted Daniel Craig in playing a good Bond. he's my favorite Bond. tough, cool, and vulnerable at the same time. it's too bad that this Bond girl is disappointing and pretentious.",positive
Um... Daniel Craig is hot. That is pretty much all that you need to know.,positive
Muy buen cuerpo jajaja,negative
"This was my favorite Bond movie. I never really liked any of the others, and I heard that if you liked the other Bond films that you might not like this one because it's so different...like it took a while for the opening sequence to have an explosion, heh.",positive
Very unexpectedly Amazing,positive
Not quite as manly...,positive
"Pretty much all of the James Bond movies are awesome. Other favorites include Goldeneye, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service.",positive
"love the prequel, but doesn't he look older than any of the other actors who played Bond?",positive
"Very entertaining...and Daniel Craig is absolutely yummy. Runs a bit on the long side, though.",positive
Finally a Bond movie that was not *only* done with CGI. Although the sinking house in Venice at the end is ridiculously badly done...,negative
Doesn't fit with the great spirit of Bond films.,negative
Daniel Craig dominates the Bond role and brings new life to an ancient icon. Eva Green is stunningly beautiful.,positive
I was bored of the Bond formula - this was great!,positive
"No esperaba que estuviera buena pero es totalmente recomendable, muy buena",negative
Best Movie to test Blu-Ray HD DVD,positive
I thought that this was supposed to be a Bond movie.,negative
"Hum...D.Graig is nice. But, this movie for sure had some space-time trouble. M is a woman and James Bond looks happy to have a Sony Ericcson Mobile phone. For a story taking place before all the other episode, this Movie should be called ""back to the casino in the royal future). Isn't it Einstein?",negative
Savior of the name James Bond. Daniel Craig was amazing and has a chance to be on the bond level of Sean Connery.,positive
"Liked alot of it, but Daniel Craig is not my favorite Bond...he was a badass, but Bond should not be a toehead. And the Bond girl drowning herself was just dumb.",negative
"Apart from the ending sequences, this doesn't feel like a Bond movie at all. Craig is great in the role, but he adds an almost out-of-character emotion to 007, along with an intensity that beats Dalton's. There are no gadgets, no maniacal villains, and at no point does the Bond theme feel appropriate. There are too many close-ups and quick cuts. There are too few quips. Yet in spite of all this, the classic character is still present, as seen in his frequent pestering of M. The story is realistic, like those of For Your Eyes Only and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which doesn't exactly fit my taste but portends a new and exciting era of Bond. Passable, but far from perfect",negative
Had a fantastic time!,positive
"If I was to have made the next Bond movie, I would have made this exact movie. Up there with the best Bond's",positive
oh this was sooo good!,negative
"Great movie. More like the older Bond movies than the newer ones, which is why I like it more.",positive
Watching it again after a while. What a great way to resurrect the Bond franchise.,positive
"Quite possibly the best Bond movie ever. Intense and well orchestrated action and well put together story. My only problem with it was that Bond wasn't as suave as normal. But still, it was still awesome.",positive
"This is one of the few movie based on a book that is actually better than the source material. Martin Campbell returned to breathe new life into Bond once again, and did so with incredible results. Let's hope that the Bond films from here on out continue to focus on quality writing and acting, like this film did.",positive
"Better dialogue than recent Bond outings, and a better plot. Some of it is really classic Bond. The best since Goldfinger.",positive
"probably the best Bond from my opinion, just because of the beginning.",positive
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!!!,positive
"Great bond film, great movie in general. I'm excited to see where they're going to go with this franchise again.",positive
Best Bond movie ever!,positive
"The weight of Broccoli's interpretation of Fleming's Bond is gone and, though it is hard to say this, Bond is the better for it. This movie is dark and intense. (Just like I like my coffee.) It approaches the word film, whereas most Bond movies work the other direction toward the B movie rating. (If only Connery had a better director producer.)",positive
"One of the more realistic bonds ever made. The fight sequences were amazing. Being a huge bond fan, this movie is definately in the top 3- and just maybe the best ever. Also, the chase scene at the beginning was off the hook. Bieng that the movie is from Fleming's origanal book is awesome. I hope the writers keep it up. If anyone disagrees with my rating, I will tie them to a chair without a bottom, and whack them.",positive
"Bond has become bond again. a swave, cool, calm, collected killer.",positive
"Me gusto mucho, daniel craig suplio muy bien a pierce brosnan",positive
Excellent - and of course Daniel Craig was very easy on the eye! lol,positive
"I'm not a big bond fan, but this one was good.",positive
"Redefined the series and I'm so glad they did!! This is the best Bond movie ever, and that is tough to say against the old Sean Connery Bonds! Watch it and see the best ever ""Bond, James Bond"" at the end...",positive
"Not the usual Bond, cold and detached, but caring and lovely and gorgeous. ROCK AND ROLL!",positive
"I'm actually a huge connery fan and a fan of the really old-school bond movies, were the concept was all about suspense and beutiful women in exotic locations. Casino Royal finally returns to the roots of 007. Thank god for Mr.Craig!",positive
"Bond is back, and he's hard as nails! An update of the most successful movie franchise of all time that really works as a thriller, as well as a Bond film. From the cool as hell opening to the last line of the film, which you may have heard before somewhere, Casino Royale rocks like a good 'un.",positive
Give it ten years and that will be me lol,positive
Brilliant. Daniel Craig is a brilliant James Bond,positive
I Actually liked a James Bond film! Can u believe it????xx,positive
Definitely the manliest Bond so far. This movie is unique in that we see the human side of Bond before he loses his soul.,positive
It's almost like they couldn't decide whether or not to make it a retro or new type of Bond.,negative
"thought it was ok, daniel craig was good but was too long, overrated",negative
I really liked Eva Green who played 'Vesper Lyn' (which is a pun on 'West Berlin)' Daniel Craig is the only bond you can believe can actually kill efficiently in hand to hand combat.,negative
"I'm sorry I liked Sean Connery, but when Daniel Craig stepped into the room and kicked the prior Bonds' butts. Uh Uh, He is the real Bond. No sixties karate chop action for him.",positive
The best Bond movie yet. I still can't believe they recked the aston martin. Thats a gorgeous car.,positive
best bond movie since the early ones.,positive
"oh my god, what more could you ask for? the classic story line of james bond, with poker, hot cars, and hot daniel craig... in a euro bathing suit",positive
"I loooooved it! haha! Full of just the right amount of action, suspence, romance, humour, umm awesomeness! haha. Never got boring for me!",positive
"Great bond, it lags in places but I like showing bond for what he is - a complete sleaze bag.",negative
This humanized Bond is quite a refreshing change.,positive
I really enjoyed this film. I think Daniel Craig is and will continue to be a much better Bond than pretty boy Pierce Brosnan. I look forward to seeing more Craig Bond films.,positive
Not nearly as good as I had heard but still decent. I think the series has made a positive turn with this movies but needs to work out the kinks.,negative
"best bond ever, so crude, so aggressive, and steel keeping up the bond style.",positive
"it was good, i'm glad that i saw it in the theater.",positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever. The Bond girl is a bitch.,positive
The first Bond film I truly enjoyed. Gives the series a much needed makeover.,negative
"Didn't finish it, wasn't very exciting to me.",negative
Great addition to my DVD collection and to the franchise of 007 films. Daniel Craig makes a great Bond and this is the grittiest of the films which makes it awesome in my book.,positive
One of the best Bond movies.,positive
"I never been a bond fan, but this movie rocked. I took away all the cheesiness and cliche of the recent films and gave back respect for the character. No rediculouse gadgets or shit storylines either. Now its beliveable he's a cold blooded kick ass spy. And Daniel Craig is probably the best bond. Much respect for Connery though.",positive
One of the greatest movies i have ever seen,positive
THE BEST bond movie ever.,positive
Very good but 1st half that is let down by a bad last 30 minutes,positive
i live the poisoing scene!,positive
"Yum! just yum... blond is the new bond. This movie was great. Very entertaining, edge of your seat... although the beginning is a bit slow.",positive
"An original and different twist to a James Bond movie I first thought and was a little cautious. No gadgets, fresh 007 license just acquired and a raw, gritty, vulnerable, cavalier approach type secret agent. Some beautiful locations, costumes and cars make Casino Royale look a million pounds and very slick. Some terrific action sequences and violent fight scenes, stunts galore but all seamlessly well captured. A tense and amusing poker game and a parkour chase over and around a construction site are a couple of highlights I enjoyed amongst many. Even the simple but effective starting credits gets my vote.",positive
this movie should never have beem made it the worst of all the james bond movie i have ever seen,negative
"Not bad, but i was especting more than this.",positive
"Best Bond yet. Daniel Craig kicks serious ass and makes Bond into someone we can all identify with, which is great. Enough with the ridiculous Pierce Brosnan movies. Bring the real Bond to life!",positive
this flim was pretty good i liked the ending an beginning best,positive
the best and most believable bond yet. Craig is much more human than the other bonds.,positive
if u like action u will love this .. off the chains..,positive
one of the few bond movies worth watching. and in my opinion.... the best so far,positive
"Thumbs down, Sean Connery was better!",negative
"James Bond! Very funny movie, James is actully making fun of some of his previous manners. Daniel Craig is very good as Mr Bond.",negative
"I thought it was good, but others like to disagree with me!",positive
much more classy than the other more rrecent bonds.,positive
Mmmmmmmmmmm those swimming shorts,positive
"Only James Bond film worth watching. Ah, yes.",positive
"Um, when did Bond learn to actually fight? great film, but it feels more like a good spy movie then a good bond movie",positive
"I gotta admit I was skeptical about not only the casting of the new Bond but the so-called 'reboot' of the franchise. Well turns out they were right on the money on both counts. Lets face it, if the timeline followed the 60s Bond movies, Bond would be well into his 70s by now. And Daniel Craig more than does the role justice - he's quite simply the best Bond since Connery. Also they finally followed the plot of one of Flemmings books almost to a tee (with a little updating here and there for the modern era's sake). This movie kicks ass and so does the new Bond - cast your doubts aside and see it!",positive
"Daniel Craig was the best James Bond, but the ""bond girl"" was the worst EVER.",positive
"Excellent, Excellent Movie. Danielle Craig is absoulutely stunning. Amustsee",positive
"Ay , mis huevos!!! ay, ouch, recontra ouch!",positive
Daniel Craig raises the bar as the new Bond as his intense character entices viewers in every scene. The story was remarkable and different and more grounded in reality. One of my favorite movies. A must see.,positive
My first Bond movie ever- all I can say is: incredible.,positive
"Because it's such a departure from the Bond films that established the genre, it's awkward to call this the best Bond film ever. But it's at least as good as any of them. Craig is a perfect choice for the role, harder-edged than Connery but somehow still charming. Eva Green is a perfect Vesper Lynd, and in fact the whole cast is fantastic except for Felix Leiter (who always sucks) and Judi Dench, a peerless actress who nevertheless has always, to me, seemed miscast as M. It's an excellent adaptation of the book and the character, and for the first time in years I can't wait for the next installment.",positive
"Could have been the best Bond movie ever made (probably because I canât remember which is which after watching a marathon every year). Where they failed, we got it they fell in love, havenât they ever heard of a montage, movie came out to 2hr 24mins???? Mainly because someone felt they had spend 30mins showing Daniel Craig and Eva Green getting to know each other. So one please tell me they hooked up after this movie. If not then it was a complete waste of time.",positive
"Daniel Craig makes the perfect next bond. And the picked the right one in the series to show case that. Back when Bond first joined the agency and was so ""refined"" if you have seen the old one.. its actually weird especially the end with the big fight seen.....",positive
"mads mikkelsen, ooo, well, maybe the best bond so far",positive
maby the best of bond-movies,positive
Best Bond film since Goldfinger.,positive
"like batman begins, this sequel made all the previous bond films look like plastic (not that it is bad..not intending to offend the bond fans but it is my opinion) as this time the all-cool bond is portrayed more vulnerable to traps and tortures, more easily shaken by emotions and relationships, less reliable on gadgets, and hence more realistic...another deserving character to note is Eva green, who has added depth to her character and thus successfully changed the way bond girls are portrayed, not just exuding physical beauty (yes she is hot indeed) but also touch us with her character's inner beauty. I hope the future bond films will , at the very leas,t be of this calibre",positive
"Sorry Danny, cannot imagine you as a Bond... You lack something I cannot define. I just don't see you as a Bond material.",negative
This movie was excellent! Much better than I expected. A grittier bond that occasionally makes mistakes. Well worth watching!,positive
Best bond of all time!,positive
"The worst James Bond ever, as an actor and a movie. After a long run I won't see any new Bonds unless Daniel Craig isn't bond. As my girlfriend said ""A Blonde Bond? Ugh!""",negative
"Best bond yet, dark, hard hitting, he's one cool bastard",positive
"Daniel Craig plays an excellent James bond, but this book to move adaptation is nowhere near as good as the older ones.",negative
"grossly disappointing. who ever did the casting needs to be fired.... Daniel Craig is no Pierce Brosnan, no ""insanely expensive, techno savvy cars"", no rediculous stunts not even one hot bond girl. Complete and total anti climax....",negative
Did you feel it? Considerably.,positive
great way to learn how 007 got started,positive
Den bedste Bond-film til dato!,positive
"Bond has grown up, maybe forced to by the tour de force of the Bourne movies. Daniel Craig is a very good actor and had to work hard for this one, he had many doubters.But for those who had seen films like Layer Cake this was never going to be a problem! It was still sexy, still funny when it needed to be and still action packed...but with out the silly gagets and over the top enemys and story...very well done Mr. Bond",positive
One of the 5 best bond movies of all times! Craig is second after COnnery!,positive
"After the awfulness of Die Another Day ,Director of Goldeneye Martin Campbell was bought back to give the series a well deserved shot in the arm. And boy does he pull it off . Danile Craig proves a revalation as a Bond with a more human side to his ego,he gives the part a lot more light and shade. The action here is good old fashioned stunt work and hardly any CGI which messed up the previous Movie. The free running sequence at the start and the airport chase are some of the best things in the Whole Bond series. The girls are great the Villain is top draw . The future for the Bond Franchise for the moment looks secure. An instant Bond film Classic",positive
OMG - how sexy is he??!!! Talk about seat wettingly fit!!!! Film was good too!,positive
En intiligent bond film.,positive
I have this on BlueRay and the quality was great! :),positive
I'm a Sean fan but Daniel has taken Bond up to another level,positive
daniel craig is the man.,negative
"In his first mission, James Bond must stop Le Chiffre, a banker to the world's terrorist organizations, from winning a high-stakes poker tournament at Casino Royale in Montenegro.",positive
"If Ian Fleming were alive today, he would be proud of the way James Bond has finally been portrayed. Hard, ruthless, using his mind rather than relying on impossible gadgets.",positive
Long time bond fanatic and it was the best one ive seen since Shawn Connery in Dr. No,positive
"Managed to add depth to a classically flat character, while simultaneously using tired conventions to dull out what otherwise would have been a fantastically sharp movie.",negative
the new james bond is great. definitely a keeper.,positive
"Without a doubt, Craig is the best Bond since Connery. This is the best Bond film since ""Goldfinger.""",positive
"2nd best bond movie, ever. I am really excited to see the new Craig one, and am excited to even be excited about the Bond series again. This movie deserved Oscar nominations, and was snubbed because it was a Bond flick. Must see, must!",positive
best bond in a very long time,positive
I do luv a good Bond film.,negative
Three words: CRAIG....IS.....BOND!,positive
why was there an extra half hour after the ending?,negative
"Great torture scene which made me go grabbin'. I like Bond this way, less smug and more human.",positive
One of the best done 007 movies today,positive
"Generally not the biggest bond fan, but this one is pretty over the top - in a good way.",positive
One of my favorite Bond's along with Goldeneye and the Sean Connery series,positive
Daniel Craig CAN be Bond! I was impressed. Even if I have no idea how the flow of the series goes anymore. This is where Bond starts... but drives an Aston Martin DBS? WTF mayte?!,positive
The only good Bond movie ever. It was a very good action film. Up until this movie I've always disliked Bond as a character.,negative
"Good looking film . . . never caught it in the theater. But Daniel Craig looks like, well, a thumpkin. All torque, no brains. Doesn't quite do it for me.",negative
Satovsky...Brian Satovsky,positive
Has Sean Connery gone blond?,positive
best bond since connery,positive
It was a good movie just not for James Bond style,negative
"I will be honest: I was not expecting much. The reason was by the time this movie was made the James Bond franchise had gone down somewhat. The reason behind that was Die Another Day for truly die hard Bond fans that movie was just horrible, and I thought it was too. This movie on the other hand was amazing. It in my opinion restored the glory of James Bond and fascinated and brought the die hard James Bond fans back to the theatre.",positive
it was sooo friggin boring. i like fell asleep,negative
great cinematography,positive
raise 700 million -.-,negative
"One of the best, but not the best.",positive
Daniel Craig was and is amazing in this movie!!!,positive
Can't get better than this...,positive
A suprisingly good movie. I loved the new twist on james Bond. Daniel Craig is one tough and mean bond.,negative
Made me love Bond movies again.,positive
new twist on a classic,positive
By far the best bond movie i have seen. The real 007 is here...IN THIS MOVIE..watch it..guaranteeing you will not be regreting.,positive
I loved Vesper Lynd.,positive
"The Best Movie of 2006, and the Best of the James Bond Series",positive
"It really bogs down in the middle, but still a good comeback for 007.",positive
i wana know who wid win in a fight bond or bourne,positive
"A Bond movie for the ""Bourne"" generation. Remember: ""Nobody does it better""!",positive
"HOW COULD THEY REPLACE PIERCE BROSNAN , THE JAMES BOND, but still an ok movie",positive
Here is a Bond for the 21st C. Daniel C is the way forward for the Bond franchise,positive
Despite all the critics and naysayers Daniel Craigs portrayel of a young vulnerable Bond makes this one of the best Bond films.,positive
at last - bond the bastard 'shaken or stirred sir' 'do i look like i care?' ooooooooo yus,positive
"Best Bond so far... for me, anyway",positive
"Oh yes, a real Bond movie, possibly the best ever Bond. Only the reboot aspect (but you overlook all of that for Bond movies). Minus half a star for an unrealistic roll of a beautiful car.",positive
uh.. I like the twist at the end!,negative
"At last, another nasty boy like Sean Connery. None of this camp nonsense like Roger Moore.",positive
"Great reviver for the film series, great action. Would like a wider emotion range though",positive
"Great reviver for the film series, great action. Would like a wider emotion range though",positive
"Non, pas en blond, ça ne fait pas du tout Bond?",negative
Daniel Craig proved to be the perfect James Bond .,negative
I want to marry Craig Daniel.,positive
Best Bond. Best Bond movie. The book's even better.,positive
"back to what makes a great bond movie...hot chicks, really badass good guys and bad guys, and lots of fighting",positive
"Estubo bien, nada mas k no es lo mismo con un Bond diferente...",negative
"Okay, if you're skeptical, give it a chance. I wasn't big on a blonde rugged James Bond... but he's great, and you soon forget all about that. It's interesting, exciting, and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. Probably the best ""movie"" of the James Bond movies; however, not at all in the trad. ""Bond movie"" style.",positive
"Not as true to the bond legacy as i hoped, but a sweet movie none the less",positive
"Bond is more human! This is represnting bond as more human not some super human spy. Some hate others will love it, if your doing media this perefcet for ur exam when u have to talk about a film",positive
"I absolutely love how they portrayed James Bond in this movie. It was raw and real, extremely entertaining.",positive
Bond has returned. Better than Sean? Discuss.,positive
"The best James Bond character period. Daniel Craig was born to play James Bond, Ian Fleming portrayed James Bond as a rough and wreckless agent just like Daniel Craig in Casino Royale",positive
Wasnt sure i was gonna like the new James Bond but that 'Sea' scene changed my find.....Mmmmm!,positive
a great introduction for daniel craig as the new bond!,positive
"i stopped watching bond for years, until now. great film.",positive
Brilliand James Bond...,positive
A lot of build up for the movie and I didnt like it as much with the new BOND actor Pierce Brosnan would have been better,negative
Well what can I say...;-) Mmmmmmm,positive
"Believe it or not, my first Bond movie.",negative
the only Bond film not for kids. Therefore the only one I like,positive
Amazing. Daniel Graig pulls it off with style!!!,positive
"Outstanding! It was a huge gamble, both to use Daniel Craig and to reinvent Bond, but this was pulled off successfully. In this film we see a more vulnerable Bond, and we focus on his early career (updated to a modern timeline) - we focus on plot more than we do cool gadgets, and this works very well. The franchise is reinvigorated, and now free of previous timelines, the sky is the limit. A+ for Daniel Craig as Bond. I hope he is on board for many more films.",positive
Excellent restart to the James Bond series. When I saw the previews I thought it would not be a good move...but I was definitely proven wrong!,positive
excellent return to form,positive
One of the best Bond Films ever,positive
Bond ilk defa bu kadar zor bir duruma dÃ¼ÅÃ¼yor. Bence Sean Connery'den sonraki en iyi Bond karakteri.,positive
The BEST BOND MOVIE EVER ! The most realistic one !,positive
I love him. not the film. Loads of action,positive
"This movie was ridiculous and I mean that in the best way. Absolutely loved it. Gripping. Affected me for days. Daniel Craig is an incredible actor and is outstanding in this. For the first time, the Bond character is given dimension. Craig brings the turmoil and darkside of the character to light, as well as the humanity of love, loss and grief.",positive
"After Brosnan, who has to be the best Bond ever, it was a tough job for anyone coming in to play that role. Craig, who is definitely not as suave as Pierce, carved a special place for himself in Bond folklore. The movie also stands out for some excellent chase sequences and the usual one Bond liners.",negative
"Nathan Fillion was right: Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever. He has some kinda crazy blue eyes, and I think watching him run may be one of the joys the universe was created for. The movie is edge-of-your-seat brutal enjoyment for most of it. Mads Mikkelson does a good job as the villain (the eye thing is SO discomforting) and there are some awesome scenes. I actually really enjoyed the poker scenes, too. I really dislike Eva Green, but the character is interesting enough. I actually expected more given the high praise the movie's gotten in reviews, but it's definitely a great, thrilling ride, except for a brief cutesy part about 3/4 of the way through that had all of us gagging. There was a little cheese in it, but not enough to ruin the movie.",negative
"This, to me, is one of the better Bond movies",positive
Best Bond movie and Craig might be the best Bond.,positive
Den bästa Bond hittills.,negative
"I would have never thought I'd enjoy a James Bond film as much as this one. Craig is Ã¼ber hot, rugged... aahh...",positive
"I love the gadgets of Bonds past and I love the cheese that was often there with the sarcastic one liners, that Sean Connery, Roger Moore and also Pierce Brosnan delivered on many occassions. This is a grittier and far deeper film then previous Bonds and somehow this let it down. It was Bond, but at the same time wasnt. It was a great spy movie and had action oozing from every part of it, However the lead character could have been anyone and not just bond. Yes he still had the bond swagger and did hit the one liners a couple times throughout, but he didnt come across as Bond as Timothy Dalton and other have. Worth a watch, but this may not be the best Bond every made. Nice car though.",negative
MY FAVORITE MOVIE PERIOD. DANIEL CRAIG IS A MASSIVE BABE!,positive
First Bond since a while (or maybe ever) that had a dialogue.,negative
"The James Bond series gets a new Bond, and a new feel to it. I rather like the change, it's action packed and doesn't scrimp on the high-tech gadgetry that is symbolic of this series. Daniel Craig makes a good start in his Bond career.",positive
"DespuÃ©s de Pierce Brosnan (el real 007) Daniel Craig ""creÃ³"" un nuevo 007, Muy buena pelÃ­cula, fuera de todos los 007, muy buena!",positive
"""whudever i am, whudever that's left of me, im yours"" My favourite quote in the movie, however cheesy. This is the most realistic Bond movie, i've watched. Bond is humane, very humane.",positive
"Bond as her should be, Dark and no corny stuff. Excelent. and i went to the premier.",positive
This could easily contend for one of the best bond films ever,positive
"Pretty good outing for James Bond, blatantly a response to the awesome Jason Bourne films. Eva Green is a hotter than the sun, Daniel Craig makes a good Bond and can surely only get better.",negative
dislike daniel craig but movie is sick,negative
"Exceptional. It's not only the best Bond film, it's one of the best of the recent spy movies that have been churned out. Instantly rewatchable with breathtakingly intense scenes and Daniel Craig IS Bond.",positive
"Best bond since Sean Connery, and the best and most exhilerating Bond film ever.",positive
phwoooooooaaaaaaaaaaar.,positive
Awesome parkour/free running bit in the second opening sequence. Really enjoyed movie as a whole.,positive
Hyvä leffa ja sitte vielä Cornellin tunnari!,positive
"Were you as tired as I was with Pierce Brosnan and all his gadgets? If you were, Casino Royale is the answer to all your problems. Daniel Craig is probably the best Bond, ever. And let's not forget about Mads Mikkelsen, who is brilliant as usual.",positive
"hands down, most beautifully shot, tasteful, intelligent, real bond film ever since the one that was good the other time. good shit.",positive
i dont like daniel craig as the new bond; but its nice to see a new bond movie; but the older ones are alot better,positive
Daniel Craig is HOTT,negative
One of my favorite Bond films. A wonderful re-boot to an already historic franchise. The new Bond has a different edge about him that is badass,positive
AWESOME. i fell in love with daniel craig. such a great love story and great action,positive
"One of the good movie of 007. Daniel Craig, he is ok.",negative
good but i dnt like the scene when he have a cardiac atacck and he survives!,positive
"New Bond is way hot, yo. Much better Bond than Brosnan and this movie had a better script, better acting, everything.",positive
my first and favorite bond movie - daniel craig is sooo hot,positive
The best bond I've seen since Goldeneye. Bond is back.,positive
"i was suprised. strange as he looks for a bond, Craig did an amazing job",positive
I think Daniel Craig did a good job as Bond. Very entertaining.,positive
I have seen a couple Bond movies but this is by far the best. It brought 007 to a human level. Really great film.,positive
In my opinion: The best Bond film since Goldfinger.,positive
The best bond film. No other bond film is as great as this one. Daniel Craig really shows why he is the man for the role as 007.,positive
"Theres never been a bond that felt this edgy! They've been cold and ruthless, but not like this!",positive
Sexiest car I have ever seen,positive
Excellent film... Craig nailed the role of Bond.,positive
Nice work. Craig kicks ass.,positive
Best Bond in the franchise. No doubt. He is perfect.,positive
"The best Bond yet, actual real Bond looking, and the initial chase scene is amazing!",positive
This was so exciting!,positive
"The best Bond flick in ages, it eschews the cheesy gadgets and overripe one liners in exchange for spectacularly staged action sequences.",positive
Quite possibly the best Bond movie ever with significantly more emotional depth than one might expect.,positive
it soudns unteresting maybe i shall watch it,positive
One of the best Bond movies ever.,positive
James Blonde was amazing. I like his acting..,negative
BEST.BOND.EVER. I don't care what you say; Daniel Craig is the best cast Bond ever.,positive
Wow. The best Bond film ever. And Daniel Craig is the best Bond. He's wonderful.,positive
Great James Bond movie! I didn't think Craig was going to be a good James Bond but he was!,positive
Awesome fight scene at the beginning of this movie. Can't wait to see where they go with this Bond/rejunvenation of the franchise.,negative
Le pire James Bond que j'ai vu.,negative
Bond back in business,positive
This has to be one of the better Bond movies. Not bad for a first timer Daniel.,positive
it was intense. plus daniel craig doesn't suck as bond.,positive
"this is a really really bad james bond and I am sad, if this is the direction 007 is being taken",negative
"After a long, crap filled period of bond pap, here we have it, the real Ian Flemming McCoy. If you loved Sean Connery but hated Roger Moore, this is for you.",positive
This is how a Bond movie should be,positive
This movie took my Bond film virginity - and I didn't want it to stop. Can't wait to watch the rest of the movies.,positive
"Good film; but when does Bond stop being Bond? Without the gadgets, cars, stupid names, hammy acting, and puns, is he just another spy?",negative
This was a cool movie. HE HAS THE BLUEST EYES!!!!!! and an 8 pack lol,positive
"I've watched every Bond movie and this was a complete disappointment. It's as if someone went all cinematic on it and tried to make it have some deeper meaning, but that's not what a 007 movie is about, it just didn't feel right.",negative
If only Brosnan had quit earlier... Bond as Fleming intended and the Classic Bond film is BACK in spectacular fashion.,positive
Great relaunching of the James Bond franchise.,positive
Casino Royale is a very welcome back-to-basics approach the the Bond franchise that was desperately needed after Die Another Day,positive
"i wasn't expecting that. very positively surprising, at times utterly different from bonds as one is used to. if this is supposed to be the future of bond movies, i'm really looking forward to seeing them!",positive
"Kan någon återuppliva Sean Connery, Bond är död :(",negative
"The biggest piece of cack i've ever seen. I know everyone worships this film, but I think this is the worst one.",negative
Having a completely different Bond was refreshing.,positive
"Holy shit, James Bond is cool again.",positive
"The dullest Bond film since, well, the previous one. Not a return to form.",negative
This is my favorite Bond flick so far. I was so excited that I actually understood what was going on! It was nice to see 007 as a human being instead of a super-agent.,positive
"Doesn't feel like a Bond film to me, I'm more used to the Connery/Moore type Bond, when I was growing up. But as a flm in it's own right, really good.",positive
This Bond is so much better than the previous ones.,positive
"Good, but it was sometimes silly how seriously this movie took itself.",negative
James Bond how he's truly portraid!,positive
mmmmmmmmm Daniel Craig - what more can I say?,positive
Not as good as the other bond films,negative
"Haven't watched another Bond movie since this came out, and that's saying something. This is Bond as Fleming wrote him.",positive
"A great way to re-open the Bond series (yes, I know that it was ""re-opened"" with Brosnan, but I don't count him as a person). Craig is perfect for the role, and in terms of action scenes, the opening chase scene is one of the best of all-time.",negative
Daniel Craig kicks Ã¤ss.,positive
"possibly one of my favorite bond movies, and that's saying a lot. daniel craig really puts new life into the role.",positive
Reminds me of Connerys Bond,positive
why reinvent the wheel? and why not Adrian Paul?,negative
except for the aston martin dying this was a super movie,positive
Completely and utterly awesome. He is James Bond.,positive
"Really good movie, but didn't really feel like a ""Bond"" movie (dunno if thats a good thing or a bad thing!)",positive
excellent movie. i really enjoyed it and daniel craig is soooo hot,positive
"Bringing back what the Bond movies are all about, removing all the gadgetry focuses the movie on the plot and characters. A perfect start to Daniel Craig's Bond career.",positive
Best bond movie of all. Actually showed 007 as a human being.,positive
ohh the first amazing james bond movie,positive
brilliant film! Daniel Craig is waaaay better than Pierce Brosnan!,positive
Another man who is not bond.,negative
Best Bond movie ever! Worst Bond girls ever!,positive
Superb - Possibly the Best Bond Film Ever !!!! :O Sorry Sir Sean,positive
cool opening then like most bond films it becomes average,negative
"Immense, can't wait for the next installment. Daniel Craig definitely the best actor to have played Bond.",positive
Daniel Craig is my new hero. It used to be superman. He is class.,positive
Two great chase sequences and lack of humour make this a more serious and edgy take on Bond. Not as much action as previously seen but still has enough to keep it going.,negative
one of the best bond ever,negative
I adore the new Bond!!! At least he doesn't look like a retired!!!,positive
really enjoyed it.. and him!,positive
the first one i saw in 007 series. its story and character was very realistic copared with other series,negative
I was never really much of a Bond Fan until this movie appeared !!! Top Notch Entertainment,positive
Best Bond next to the Sean Connery.,positive
"The most believable Bond to date, and thus, the most enjoyable.",positive
"The best bond to date, Daniel Craig delivers an intense performance which injects new life into the 007 agent.",positive
the chase in madagascar is quite possibly my favorite action scene ever... and daniel craig won me over by the end of this film.,positive
"Pretty brave move to choose a meaty blonde dude, but it seemed to work.",positive
wonderful! great cast and story line - don't really care about the added Hollywood bits...,negative
"Great reboot of the franchise. Plotline gets a little confusing at the end, but there are so many other reasons to like this movie. Daniel Craig is great -- instead of simply trying to fill Connery's shoes, he makes his own pair.",positive
good bond film. daniel actually suprised me being so good as a 007 agent,positive
"I'm a huge James Bond fan. I even like all Brosnan Bonds. Okay, they aren't as good as Bond could, but I still like them. They're fuckin' JAMES BOND, ok? But this one fortunately put them on a serious level again. Daniel Craig is the killer.",positive
Worst of all Bonds!!!!,negative
"las escenas de accion, estupendas; el actor, el mejor bond en mucho tiempo; el argumento, del montoncillo y la chica, un error de casting",negative
"A very satisfying action film, but I didn't buy the love story and the poker scene was a snooze.",negative
"""shaken or stirred?"". ""Do I look like I give a damn?"" Almost as good as 'big Tam' Connery...pure class.",positive
James Bond reinvented and I must admit I love!,positive
Craig is definitely on a par with Connery,positive
"It sort of didn't feel like Bond, but it sort of did. I'm confused. Must be me trying to get used to a new 007 face. Well, this one was pretty good.",positive
Since when did Bond have feelings that weren't in his pants? This Bond is so emo I thought he was put on the chicks pants after he banged her.,negative
makes me question my long held opinion on who the best bond is...,positive
best bond ever! cannot look away!,positive
"It's pretty fantastic. I think Daniel Craig comes awfully close to stealing the rank of ""Best Bond"" from Sean Connery. Ok...maybe not that close. But he is still damn good.",positive
I like this James Bond..coz he actually was falling on love...not just want to have sex after all.,negative
The very best Bond movie yet. Hardcore action and drama. Totally badass.,positive
"Quite a nice piece of work. Not sure if Craig is up to the task, but I am sure he did a great job. I hope to see him in other bond movies. The film itself was not bad, but I still like more Dr. No.",negative
"This movie is amazing. Most people argue it isn't a real ""bond movie"", but i disagree. This is the movie that explains the begining of Bond's career, and how he became a double 0, and why he is a womanizer.",positive
One of the three best Bond movies ever. LOVED it.,positive
much better than pierce brosnan,positive
"Bond movies were getting ridiculous. Luckily, this saved the franchise by simplifying everything done to a good ol kick ass action movie.",positive
The new bond did a good freakin job.,positive
Daniel Craig took James Bond to the next level. I loved the old Sean Connery movies - but I might even dare to say that I liked Craig more!,positive
"Succeeds where the other Bond movies fail, mostly because it copies the superior Bourne films step-for-step.",negative
Daniel Craig is so much better than pretty-boy Pierce Brosnan. I like him a lot as Bond - best one since Connery.,negative
The best James Bond ever! More realistic. Great debut for Daniel Craig.,negative
"Love the new Bond; but I think the franchise has lost a touch of class. Bond gets more ""American-ized"" every movie...",negative
"One of the best action Bonds I have ever seen. Daniel Craig did a great job. And yeah, I know it's not typical Bond, but guess what assholes, it was supposed to be Bond, before he was ""Bond"". Make sense now? Jackasses.",positive
I love it love it love it.,positive
This is the best Bond movie.,positive
WOW! He's so hot. Lots of action,positive
Bond is back (if a bit blonde?!)!,positive
Great action movie. Bond actually has a character. You get a clue what drives him. And he has a consistent flaw: he doesn't know how to lose - even when he's losing.,positive
"The best Bond movie, and maybe the best Bond, ever.",positive
"Stunningly good, worth seeing for the crane scene alone",positive
Best bond film I have ever seen.Mind you that isnt saying too much.,positive
Bond + parkour + poker = A+!,positive
Am I in danger of being shot...but I think this was probably one of the best 007 movies...ever!,positive
Daniel Craig gives back to James Bond charm and personality. The best since Sean Connery quit.,positive
best bond movie so far,positive
This movie is very...... exciting?,positive
"I love all Bond Films, was interested to see how Daniel Craig would fare as Bond ...& I thought he was very well cast. He comes a close second/maybe even a tie with the best Bond - Sean Connery (of course!).",positive
I LOVE DANIEL CRAIG!,positive
"HHhhhh...the shorts...the shoulders, the...budgie struggling for freedom... Ignore the sappy bit towards the end and it's great, a proper hard nut Secret Agent!",positive
Incredible. Nearly as good as 'Live and Let Die'!,positive
"People, we have a new James Bond!",positive
Can't fault decision to make Daniel Craig the new Bond. Better than Dalton who was my previous favourite,positive
I was not disappointed with this. The initial fight scene draw you right into it. The poker drags though.,negative
A great reboot of the 007 series that really takes it back to its roots when Bond kick ass without fancy gadgets,positive
Excellent fresh start in the franchise.,negative
The best bond movie in years. Daniel Craig is up there with Sean Connery.,positive
best bond in a long while,positive
"Entertaining, crappy poker.",negative
A great debut for Daniel Craig as Bond in a complete reinvention of the series that is far more gritty and realistic.,negative
"This movie changed my life. ok, not really. well, maybe it has.. I've decided I want to marry Daniel Craig.",positive
I was very surprised by the performance of Daniel Craig. Above average Bond film.,negative
"Definetly the most painful and uncomfortable torture scene ever. Well, at least of the movies I've seen.",negative
"Best line from Bond. Vesper Lynd: Am I going to have a problem with you, Mr. Bond? James Bond: No, don't worry, you're not my type. Vesper Lynd: Smart? James Bond: Single.",positive
"The best Bond movie to date. Never thought I would see a Bond better than Dalton or a Bond movie better than OHMSS, but there you go!",positive
"Different, but change is good.",positive
ya i own this one on a dvd ! seen it N times! really raw and real ! not flasy like the othee bond movies! the porcue chase is too good!,positive
I have watch every 007 movie. This is the WORST I've ever watched! Too long & boring!,negative
Daniel Craig did for Bond what Christian Bale did for Batman... he made it HOT again,positive
"Bond is human in this movie, and some of the plot twists elicit emotion. Far more than testosterone run wild.",positive
Best Bond movie ever! Daniel Craig is amazing!,positive
"HELL YEAH! This one totally gets the blood pumping. A human Bond... and yet, the best one ever. Not to mention Chris Cornell's great track...!",positive
daniel craig is not james bond this was just a shitty movie that really let me down now is the first time i have ever said this i want peirce back and i wish connery was still young,negative
Who James Bond needs to be.,positive
Much better than expected. I was pleased with added character development and departure from the traditional Bond formula.,positive
"If you forget this is supposed to be a Bond movie, it's not a bad action flick.",negative
Possibly the best Bond film yet.,positive
"IMO there were NO Bond movies between Goldfinger and Casino Royale. I was very skeptical about Daniel Craig as Bond but now I'm a believer. This film made Bond a real person but he lost none of the style and suave that makes him Bond. Eva Green is an atypical ""Bond girl"" in that she is edgy, smart, and savvy. She's the typical Bond girl in that she is drop dead gorgeous. I loved the locations and the cinematography. Although Sean Connery will always be my favorite Bond, this is my favorite Bond film. Can't wait til the next one!",positive
"The way Bond films should've always been: serious, gripping, plausible. Without question, the best Bond yet.",positive
IT ALWAYS KEPT ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT,positive
"new bond kickin ass and takin names, love chris cornell song",positive
"A fantastic Bond movie. The gadgets aren't the center and he's not effin' invincible, and by jove, sometimes he makes mistakes. Marvelous opening sequence.",positive
What a performance by Danny boy. I just love that one-liner after he almost gets poisoned to death.,positive
A blonde bond? it worked for me!,positive
Best Bond film in ages,positive
Boring! if I want to spend an hour watching a poker game I'll goto the casino not the movies.,negative
sexiest Bond! best hunting scene right in the beginning!,positive
It took me a bit to warm to Daniel Craig as Bond. But this film is a good revision of the franchise and a fairly good adaptation of the novel.,positive
Great action movie with great (impossible) gadgets.,positive
Probably the best Bond movie ever made. Daniel Craig is brilliant.,negative
Great film. Bond was rough and not so comical as previous ones! Daniel Craig is fab as Bond! It also helps that he's unbelievably sexy! I've not been the same since watching him!!,positive
great new start to the series,positive
"Definitely one of the better Bond films I've seen. Somehow Daniel Craig's got the ruggedness factor that Brosnan doesn't. Thats what Bond should be like. Craig's taking on Bond makes Bond seem more human, aka imperfect.",positive
the must seee film from james bond. Daniel Craig bravo.,positive
"The fact that I found this watchable (and in fact mildly entertaining) - even ridiculously hungover at 9.30 am in a cinema in Lancaster, and aside from the fact that the whole James Bond thing doesn't appeal to me in the slightest... well, I reckon it must be pretty good. Daniel Craig is alright, but he's always just going to be Joe Rose to me.",negative
my best bonds film!!,positive
he is a good actor but does not fit as James Bond,negative
Bond. Raw. Unkempt. Not superhuman. Doesn't always get the girl. Loses occasionally. Better. Much Better. The last one of any sort of value was Goldeneye.,negative
"Ainoa Bond elokuva, josta oikeasti pidin",negative
Daniel Craig is the best Bond!,positive
"""I loved it loved it loved it big time ooh baby that Daniel Craig is the best james bond ever and the movie had more action and alot of excitement I will watch it over and over again",positive
This film has certainly made James Bond return back to the basics and back to good films that make sense and aren't completely outrageous. This grounds it solidly in reality and for that it is good. I must say that Daniel Craig suits this Bond and is a welcome addition to the film. I look forward to seeing Bond 22 when it comes out.,positive
"Two words... Daniel Craig, yum yum!! One for the girls.",positive
"This is by far the best bond film around, its a very dark spy film, much like the bourne series with very little gadgets or stupid cases and OH MY GOD what a car!",positive
The best Bond film I have ever seen. He is a nasty SOB and very believable.,positive
Craig is my favorite Bond...ever.,positive
"One of the best James Bond movies of all time. If you liked Mr. Daltons ""real-world"" Bond then you will love this...",positive
I think this may just be my favourite bond flick....,positive
What bond was meant to be 21 films and 45 years ago,positive
Daniel Craig IS 007. He is definately the best Bond. One of my all time favorite movies.,positive
"I'm a believer, Daniel Craig is the new James Bond...although I still wish Pierce was making the movies.",positive
please take note: this is how you make james bond bad ass.,positive
Bond is not a nice guy. He is a cold assassin. They finally got it right.,positive
I was quite surprised by this film.,negative
"WORST Bond ever, after Moonraker that is.",negative
bond is blonde!! awesome!,positive
Wonderful Bond! Far better choice than Pierce Brosnan. He was always Mr. Steele to me --> TV show called REminton Steel...,positive
not my favorite James Bond...,negative
the new 007 is friggin awesome great action awesome plot good ending :],positive
Best Bond movie since Thunderball.,positive
My opinion: Best Bond movie so far!!!,positive
i enjoyed it. lots of crazy things happen in this movie. very different then the old james bond.,positive
Older ones seem to be better to me...,positive
boring. poor Bond and his never-ending girls.,negative
"Probably one of, if not the best Bond film out there.",positive
The best Bond movie in decades!,positive
"i was skeptical about a blonde james bond, but daniel craig set me straight!",positive
"Daniel Craig was better than Sean Connery ever could be, I love this movie.",positive
More like a 24: the movie then bond,negative
Briiliant Performances by Daniel Craig!,positive
the best bond movie ever,positive
I've never seen the other Bond films but Craig did a decent job.,negative
Sean Connery just lost the mantle as the better Bond unfortunately - I never thought I'd say that.,negative
"Slightly different from the other Bond movies, but just as good if not better.",positive
need to see this if you have not.,positive
prefiero mil veces a brosnan,negative
Rad movie...but missing too many key bond elements.,positive
"A great new look at a new James Bond, even though he runs so much through this whole movie (He runs like T-1000, he is like an unstoppable machine). A great story, good action.",positive
"A departure from the standard Bond formula but it works. The foot chase, holy crap that was awesome. Considering when this movie is supposed to exist in the Bond universe it is a perfect movie to explain Bond. I'm not sure if I'd go gaga over Daniel Craig or not but that's just a personal taste thing anyway. It is too bad they made Eva Green look like Cleapatra through the entire movie, what a waste but Caterina Murino too bad she dies!",positive
Daniel Craig dio la talla par James Bond...Una de las mejores peliculas de laserie,positive
"Moi qui deteste James Bond, la j'ai kiffÃ©!",positive
Never liked James Bond but loved this!,positive
"Very Realistic, good action shots, excellent choice of new Bond.",positive
"Daniel Craig is the best Bond in many, many years",negative
"I love the new blond bond! He looks so good in that suit. It was a very cool movie (when he jump starts his heart, so cool!).",negative
"I don't like Bond at all, but Craig is surprisingly good.",negative
not as good as it should have been... disappointing,negative
Best Bond Film made!!,positive
Good to see Bond getting his hands dirty again.,negative
The best Bond for a long long time!,positive
"GoldenEye and now Casino Royale...why doesn't the Brocolli bunch hire Martin Campbell to do more Bond films? He clearly understands how to do a great Bond film. Once more Cambell introduces audiences to a new Bond for a new era. Daniel Craig very nicely grows into the iconic secret agent in a very different world of espionage, far removed from the cold war influences of the book in which the film is based on. Yet the film stays pretty faithful to that rugged Bond first imagined by its creator while gradually reintroducing his smoother character traits that have emerged from the long-running spy franchise.",positive
"I found Casino Royal to be a surprisingly enjoyable and very well done movie. Best Bond film for years, if not ever.",positive
this is the only james bond movie i hav ever seen but it was really good,negative
"I seem to be one of the few people not to like this movie. It was a bit ""oh poor Bond has had his heart broken"" - which isn't what Bond is about. Plus I just don't think his charming enough for a Bond.",negative
Good modernized take on Bond. Daniel Craig portrayed 007 well.,positive
"Take one of the most successful movie series of all time, and restart it with the realism and intelligence of the original Sean Connery pictures, and you strike action movie gold.",positive
I was very suprised at how much I liked this.,negative
"i am a big fan of bond films in general, but this one was the BEST",positive
"Gritty, fun, and real. This Bond delivers. Daniel Craig was the best decision for Bond.",positive
Thank you Daniel Craig for bringing some mojo back to James Bond.,positive
Jsui fan de 007 et celui-lÃ  relance la serie de la plus belle des maniÃ¨res,positive
great movie and daniel craig makes a good bond.,positive
"i like perfect,godly,gadgety james bond",negative
"The film looks more like a Mission Impossible than a Bond film. However, Craig is a gritty Bond and the bulk of the film time is good entertainment. Craig acts well and continues the fun and humour from previous Bonds but I say, bring Pierce Brosnan back!",positive
"By far the best bond film I have seen. I did not expect anything good, oh how foolish I was. I didn't think Daniel Craig could quite pull off the suave of Pierce Brosnan... But he did...",positive
i love this movie so much,positive
Best New Bond Film yet,negative
"I read all the Ian Fleming novels when I was in my early teens and Daniel Craig and Sean Connery are the 2 actors that most resemble Ian Fleming's Bond. Regardless, I like ALL the Bonds with the exception of Lazenby.",positive
Bond with a bad side... think i may like it...,positive
"Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever. Excilerating, edge of seat action movie 10/10",positive
Clearly the best Bond movie ever (including Connery's Mr. No and his other Bond flicks). Danial Craig is superb.,positive
Bond reinvented and it works too,positive
"Best James Bond film since goldfinger, better then goldeneye. Craig plays it down and dirty with some great action scenes and poker that doesnt bore you to death!",positive
"Daniel Craig is the best bond, he definetly proved himself in this movie..WE WANT A SEQUEL!!",positive
Slick rebirth of Bond. The first Bond that leaves no doubt that he's harder than a coffin nail and cooler than an ice cube.,positive
"A very nice action movie, tough it really isn't James Bond.",positive
"BEST of the new Bond Films. Pierce, eat your heart out baby.",positive
Brilliant film - Daniel Craig is the best Bond yet. Very sexy!,positive
"Best Bond since Connery's early days, and nice to see some elements of the novel retained",positive
would love to meet mr bond,positive
I have now seen it twice and it is much better this time than the last. Maybe it was because others bad judgement influenced me that time...,positive
"They took bond, they brought it back to the future, and they made it great again. What more can I say?",positive
"""I'm the money"" ... ""every penny of it""",positive
FINALLY! We get Ian Fleming's James Bond on screen. It was worth waiting 54 years for them to get it right...,positive
"Daniel Craig is great Bond! This was a higly entertaining Bond film. It was very different from Pierce's Bond, which was a good thing because no two Bonds should ever be alike. Looking forward to the next installment :)",positive
"Well D C, what more do I need to say",positive
Daniel Craig is the only Bond. As always the action scenes are too long but I forgive that because of the turquoise swimming trunks and Eva Green's sarcastic character.,positive
A surprisinly asorbing Bond film. It is not all girls and gadgets.,negative
Best Bond film ever.,positive
"The best Bond yet, and I've seen them all.",positive
An excellent return of James Bond in a way most befitting the character. Strong performance with a well written screenplay & thoroughly enjoyed this film.,positive
Craig=hottest thing alive(saying that as heterosexually as possible),positive
Loved the Parkour chase at the start of the movie. The rest of the movie was great. It gives Bond a new cool attitude and feel.,positive
daniel craig will be a good bond,negative
"I was upset when Bronson was tossed aside, but Craig won me over.",positive
"Not the traditional Bond, he's the strong and silent one!",positive
Gotta love Bond... Dude almost dies in the middle of a poker game... and still wins!,positive
"Awesome flick. Daniel Craig may just be the next best Bond besides Sir. Sean Connery, of corse.",positive
ok action movie just not a good Bond movie,negative
"As always, there was great scepticism around the new James Bond. Having seen Layer Cake, I was quite confident in Daniel Craig being able to pull it off, and he does, with ease. Some now say he may be the best Bond ever, or if not that, that this is one of the best Bond movies. I have to agree. Very good opening action sequence which is basically free running on steriods (the character Bond is chasing is a well known free runner). I like the play betwen Daniel Craig and Eva Green. Mads Mikkelsen is a good villain too. There isn't much not to like in this movie, though I'm sure all the card playing was a challenge to make interesting.",positive
Bond is back..and he's a dick!,positive
"Kept falling asleep, but I want to see it again.",negative
"There is a new sherriff in town, as far as the 007 scene is concerned. Not to say that any of the other Bonds were bad, but there is a marked difference in Die Another Day (Pierce Brosnan) and Casino Royale (Daniel Craig). The new Bond is far younger, in better shape, and more adventurous than the Bonds of Old, and he brings all of those qualities with him as he plays one of the most in-tune 007's of all time. As yet, he cannot even touch the legend that is Sir Sean Connery, but his style of acting lends itself to reach that level when given the caliber of screenplay that he had for his first time out. You'll notice that the only gadgets that he gets are fairly simple in nature. He has a car, a silenced PPK, and a defibrilator, as well as some basic antidotes to common poisons. It's like back in the heyday of the 1960's when all Sir Connery had was, well, a car, a gun, and his wits to keep him alive and accomplish the mission. The gadgets that have been present in the latest Bond films served a dual role of making the movie more cheesy and creating the atmosphere that Bond was simply a wild man who got all sorts of free toys from the British government. The problem with that is that it made the more recent films fall very short on basic elements like plotlines. Casino Royale brings back the power of the storylines of old, and creates a different kind of Bond altogether, harkening back to the good old days when we respected Bond for his ability to do business, earning him nicknames like ""Mr. Kiss-Kiss Bang-Bang"" in Japan all thos years ago. This film has restored my faith in the good people of Eon Productions to create a masterpiece film, and still keep the theaters full. Even the One-Liners first introduced by Sean Connery that made Bond the character that he has come to be known are back, and most of them couldn't be more appropiate. Ladies and Gentlemen, James Bond is back and he's better than he has been in a long time. Give this movie the time of day, and you will be more satisfied than after On Her Majesty's Secret Service (which was terrible).",positive
Best Bond in many years... Up with Goldfinger among best ever.,positive
"The first Bond movie in a long time that hasn't sucked. Daniel Craig is really good as an emerging Bond, a thug learning the appearance of polish in order to achieve his double-0 status. Much closer to the Bond of the Fleming novels. A good story as well without all of the ridiculous conceits of the other films.",positive
"By itself this movie wasn't bad at all, perhaps even earning 3.5 stars. HOWEVER, in conjuction with the Bond name, this rates as one of the worst. After all the character development we've seen, the suave, debonair Bond who is always confident, they try and make him look weak. The final straw was the actor. He looked more like a stereotypical Nazi than a British secret service agent, and there wasn't even a British accent. How...... disappointing.",negative
best bond movie ever!,positive
Best Bond flick period,positive
Daniel Craig...in speedos..yes please.,positive
"Oh well,another 007..better than I expected..",negative
A lot of thrills and action. Something great always happens from one scene to another. It's just great.,positive
Possibly the best bond film there is!,positive
one of the best Bond films ever.,positive
"Better than some of the earlier Bond films. Craig made an excellent debut and with a strong plot and appealing characters, this was phenomenal.",positive
Didn't realise how cheesy Bond had become until I saw this. Best Bond film ever.,positive
Daniel Craig did a good job as Bond but I prefer Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan,positive
good action and took bond to a new and serious level.,positive
"Great stuff. Wasn't sure if Daniel Craig would be a good Bond, but he was. And great body coming out of the sea! Phwoar!",positive
"Right up until the end of the Poker scene this is the best Bond has been for years, unfortunately it loses all coherence in the latter stages, and the ending sequence in Venice was such a let down. Still, Daniel Craig made a superb Bond, if a touch all knowing, and the rest of the cast played their roles to perfection.",negative
Best Bond in a long time,positive
Awesome Bond movie he is back ad better than ever. great story and some excellent action,positive
"Bond returns in Casino Royale with a new look and a brand new beginning. After new movies like the Bourne series have stole Bond's thunder, Casino Royale introduces to a new James Bond, who is tougher and more cold blooded than ever. Daniel Craig is possibly the Best Bond yet, he definitely fits the book character better than anyone. I love that Bond has returned to the best spy flicks, because it did need a change after the series got far too unrealistic. Good plot and characters make Casino one of the best Boind films yet. Most credit goes to Craig, who has restored the Bond legacy.",positive
More Bonds like this please,negative
"best Bond movie ever...i love poker and i love Aston Martins..when they're both in a movie together, its a badass movie...",positive
Love it! he's the tightest Bond!,positive
I love the new James Bond! My favorite bond movie :),positive
"For sure one of the best Bond movies. New, fresh look and Craig grows in the role. I like his style. Most or many gadgets in place and the humor is there. Look forward to the next one.",positive
"Nya James Bond, Daniel Craig, Ã¤r en riktigt bra actionhjÃ¤lte.",negative
"CAN'T STOP WATCHING THIS FILM. IT'S GREAT, ALTHOUGH I DO LIKE ROGER MOORE AS BOND AS WELL - NEEDS SOME CHEESE TO CARRY IT OFF!!",positive
pretty awesome new look at James Bond.,positive
Love Daniel Craig. Great action in the beginning. And then the movie devolves into bad dialogue and a lack of chemistry between the lead characters. Even Judi Dench feels wasted. Though perhaps when you watch a JB movie you're meant to suspend disbelief on every level imaginable.,negative
"Not that keen on the new Bond, and way to long. The ending is just crap. These films are so far behind movies like the Bourne films. You can always tell how hard they are selling the new bond by how many times he takes his clothes off....",negative
this could possibly be my favorite bond movie ever. this is bond how bond is supposed to be,positive
"The best Bond film since On Her Majesty's Secret Service, at last we get a Bond rooted in some kind of reality, even if he does run through a wall and survives an Aston Martin flipping over 7 times and...",positive
Best Bond film for ages,positive
"i was soooooooo fucking disapointed!! Daniel Craig is the worst Bond ever! He's even worse then George Lazenby!! i give it 2,5 stars because of the action scenes not because of that blond",negative
"I wanted to love this movie. I rate Craig as an actor (and like him in many films he is in), but never enjoyed his interpretation of Bond. To be brutally honest, I preferred Pierce Brosnan or even Timothy Dalton (naturally he was better than Roger Moore and not as good as Sean Connery, surely everyone who is sane would agree on that). I mostly blame the direction, which was as uninspired as Campbell's last attempt at Bond (Goldeneye). There was also no chemistry between Craig and Eva Green (who is admittedly gorgeous, but not as sexy as in the Dreamers). The story was an unhappy compromise between the raw edge in the original Fleming novel and the trappings of product-placement friendly action set-pieces of recent Bonds. It steals a few of Bourne's tricks, but has learnt nothing from that franchise's commitment to realism. The ending totally failed to engage my emotions, and i just felt that Bond was a bit of idiot for not seeing the obvious twist.",negative
"So, basically, they've RE-INVENTED Bond...",negative
Fuckin' 'ell! I've seen every Bond movie and this was by far the best.,positive
"Entirely too long, someone please tell me why they couldn't condense it into a normal 2 hours? Sorry it just dragged too much. Would have been better if it were snappier and faster-moving but as it was I found myself looking at my watch wondering ""When is this going to be over?""",negative
Finally a James Bond you can believe is really a killer.,positive
yup he's the new 007 alright!,positive
much better than the original... which the americans compleatley annihilated. Didn't know weather the remake would have worked so long after..... but it just does,positive
the best bond movie ever,positive
"Good action movie, but lacking a bit of the classic Bond styling. Inevitable with a new Bond actor, but it was still lacking a bit in gadgets, car chases and a little Bond charm and witty conversations. Otherwise it is a decent action spy type movie.",positive
"a good film, but Craig is not 007",negative
"Hmmm. I am still not sure about Craig as Bond. Sure this is a good film, but is it a James Bond film? Lets do the list: Aston Martin....Check (two actually) Wise cracks.....Check Guns / Explosions....Check Car Chase......Sort of Super fortressâ¦â¦â¦..Nope Beautiful women....â¦.Ah With the last two I think we are getting to the nub of the problem. Itâs all very noble trying to shake up the admittedly formulaic nature of 007 flicks, but I canât help this is too much too soon. Itâs like being chucked into cold water, and as a true Bond fan you either swim or die. I am personally left gasping. My only hope is that the way Bond is burnt by a woman in this film is used to explain his attitude to the opposite sex and paves the way for a return to form in future films. Final word however must go to the record breaking Aston roll stunt: Superb.",negative
Best Bond film I've ever seen. The only down side is that Eva Green is in it.,positive
"its bond, that means its awesome",positive
"I'm not a big fan of Bond films, but this, in my opinion, is the best Bond film ever.",positive
What a breath of fresh air....not a cheesy line or gag in site...great stuff,positive
"The measure of this movie is how backward it is but it is so excellent that you just accept it all and suspend disbelief. Brilliant casting, raw, exciting more more more more",positive
"James Bond, James Bond, Bond, James, STFU, everyone loves you. I HATE YOU. You suck. No matter who plays you, you will always suck. You should have HIV or at least crabs on your crotch. You should have died a hundred times, or at least have crabs on your crotch. Your movies are lame, weak and extremely hard to watch due to pointless action scenes that lead no where but the end of the plot line...which is weak... STUF I HATE YOU",negative
Yeni versiyon James Bond ve gercekten cok guzel.,positive
Bond reborn = brilliant,positive
"After all the different Bonds, Daniel Criag would be a little to old for a rookie Bond, wouldn't it though? Being green, it was overall nicely done. A Ramington Steele's age Brosnan or Simon Templar's age Moore would have been perfect. Too bad we couldn't turn the clock back.",positive
only good 007 was pierce brosnan!,negative
"definately the best bond movie i've seen, a redefining moment of the series...",positive
Best Bond and Bond film in ages. I own it ON BLU-RAY! Don't mess...,positive
Daniel Craig IS James Bond,positive
My favorite Bond I think.,positive
Best bond film for ages.,positive
Best Bond since Connary... and it's been really really REALLY bad since then.,positive
"This movie is far and away the best thing to happen to the Bond franchise since Pierce Brosnan signed on. A return to the gritty, rough and tumble, hands-on Bond of the Connery era was exactly what was needed to recover from the high-tech plots that made the recent films fall flat.",positive
kicks some serious ass,positive
Best Bond movie in years,positive
Daniel Craig lacks charm but Eva Green makes up for it with a fair bit of attitude.,negative
best bond since sean....loved the gritty realism not all pretty pretty as usual,positive
"I like ketchup and I like peaches, but that doesn't mean they should mix. Yes, Daniel Craig does in fact kick ass. James Bond also kicks ass. However, Craig is not Bond. He's effin blond! I would have much preferred to continue with Brosnan or start fresh with Clive Owen. Also, the plot was quite confusing and despite my boy explaining it to me multiple times, I don't understand how this film fits in with the rest of the 007 lexicon.",negative
"I was wowed by this one. One of the best Bond's in my opinion because he actually showed character development throughout the movie. And the action sequences were great, and everything you'd expect from a 007 film. Awesome movie.",positive
"Not a Bond fan, but this owned",positive
Best Bond Film since Connery played 007. Pierce Brosnan who? Daniel Craig did an excellent job as 007 and overall a great movie.,positive
"What a change from the traditional image of a Bond character! I was big big fan of the suave moving Pierce, but Craig really shows what the brutality of James Bond is like. Great movie!",positive
excellent premier of Daniel Craig as the new Bond!,positive
the best bond ever made,positive
Modern classic redefined the dying Bond series. Very accurate to the oringinal book and ultimately the most accurate portrayal of Ian Flemming's James Bond.,positive
"Daniel Craig really nailed James Bond from beginning to end. The right balance of action and story making James Bonds first mission as 007 gritting and realistic, finally getting rid of the campness of Peirce's last couple of Bond movies. I hope Daniel Craig does at least 5 films.",positive
Best Bond yet. My favorite. Great wit.,positive
ya well ... it's no Golden Eye.,negative
"It was a good movie...but he did suck as Bond in my opinion...it looked like his head was too small for his body, like that character from beetlejuice sprinkled some dust on his head...",positive
"Great opening and I liked the ""grittier"" vibe. Definitely one of the best Bonds.",positive
"Great look at the imperfect Bond, some real humanity to his character, but still a loyalist & a patriot to the throne.",positive
brilliant! much better than the brosnan ones,positive
"Highly entertaining, more action, a new kind of Bond movie... as my friend Nicole put it, this was a Bond movie for the ladies- more naked Bond than naked chicks!",positive
Best Bond that I have ever seen the plot hit the poker trend at the right spot and the great action,positive
Wasnt really a bond fan before this movie,positive
"Bond is blonde!!!!Like we give a damn,Craig kicks ass and this film completely revitalises the franchise!!Look out Bourne, 007 is Back!!!!",positive
"Fast paced, entertaining movie.",positive
A GREAT way to relaunch the Bond Series. And after all the hubub about Craig being picked to be Bond are shot to hell by the end of this modern masterpiece.,positive
"By far the best Bond movie. I much prefer the grittier Bond, prone to mistakes, heartbroken, but still determined to get the job done. Fun to watch!",positive
"I'm apparently two years late in seeing this because I was hesitant in excepting a new James Bond, but this movie was amazing! If the chase scene in the beginning doesn't win you over, then you won't enjoy this movie, but I loved it",positive
Showed a more human bond. Craig would whoop any bond in the past for sure. Fewer ridiculous gadgets and just raw bond. AWESOME!,positive
I could even go as far to say that Daniel Craig is a better Bond than Connery.,positive
daniel is the best bond!,positive
Great bond film Im still a Shaun Connery fan at heart tho,positive
One of my top three Bond films!,positive
"""Now everyone is going to know you died scratching my balls!""",positive
"Bond is cool, slick and Daniel Craig plays him so well. The best bond film yet.",positive
"good movie, but idk, i think i liked the other bond movies better...",positive
He is a very hot Bond,positive
THIS IS NOT A JAMES BOND MOVIE!!!,negative
Craig is the best Bond since Connery; on the evidence of this looking forward to a long and exciting list of new Bond films. It completely rejuvenates a dying brand,positive
"Full house, full house, four of a kind, straight flush",negative
!!!! clearly the best bond ever !!!! The intro alone i watched about 15 times. ( so far ) i love the music that was made just for the movie and just fucking fanatastic!!!!!!!,positive
"Its not the geatest bond movie, but it will do",positive
"Amazing. I wasn't sure about Daniel Craig as the new Bond, but I loved it. This is a different Bond - a much closer character to Ian Fleming's original literary figure.",positive
The storyline & the amount of action scenes was good but I have 2 issues... 1. I spent the whole film waiting for Q and the cool gadgets to appear but they never did and... 2. Daniel craig just doesnt fit the bond image and the man can act to save his life. I guess im just dissapointed cuz usually after watching a newly released bond film you can see the gadgets and think 'oh cool i wonder if someone will make on of those' but with no gadgets in this its just another action film. Thats why i haven't bothered 2 watch it untill now. Lets hope the next 1 goes back to the classic bond style films with a new actor as bond.,negative
"So far the best Bond film in my opinion, Daniel Craig is pry going to be Bond again I bet.",positive
"the new James Bond sux ass, ok? he is the worst out of all the James Bond and he is just screwing up the James Bond 's image",negative
"One of my favourite Bond films, Daniel Craig does wonders as bond.",positive
The best Bond by far - I felt like I wanted more at the end of the movie. Craig has saved this franchise - all credit to him after all the flack he got beforehand!,negative
good way to start a new james bond,positive
Utrolig bra action film!,positive
"If you can follow it, it's friggin sweet.",positive
great film seen it like it buy it lol,positive
its better than the peirce brosman years,positive
One of the best movies ever made. I was captivated from the opening theme song and credits to the very end. Outstanding in every way!,positive
Bedre enn på lenge...,negative
Best Bond film since Sean Connery!!!! Puts Pierce Brosnan to shame [who was my 2nd favourite Bond until i saw this] Who'd have thought a blond Bond would work?,positive
"Same as Batman begins....first real Bond, for one he actually loses, that was a nice twist, and I never thoght that guy could be sexy....but hey....la carne es debil",positive
"Never was a 007 until this movie. Excellent, tight, well executed action adventure.",positive
"Oh oui. Je suis fan des James Bond, surtout des anciens, mais celui la fou un bon coup, pour son bien, au stereotype de l'agent inebranlable.",positive
Buff Bond...hubba hubba! Can't wait for the next one.,positive
I liked the ultimate running sequence. And a lot of the camera work. Everything else was pretty bad. I miss Pierce.,negative
Looks aamazing on Blu-ray Disc in 1080p,positive
"Best of all the newer Bond movies, it was nice to see a bond with flaws.",positive
"This movie is the best bond movie yet. Craig is smooth and sexy, he steals every part of the movie. Mass Mikkelsen does a good job too.",positive
daniel craig is a bad ass!,positive
The best bond movie for a long time. Daniel Craig fits pefect as James Bond.,positive
"This definitely maintained the James Bond reputation, although it had an interesting twist, it being before James Bond was actually James Bond.",positive
Critics were proved wrong - one of my favourite Bond films.,positive
"Hard to get used to a new bond at first, but once you get past his blond hair and unmanly manners, it's a great movie, can't wait to see him in more",positive
El mejor Bond de la historia,negative
Best Bond flick in a good while,positive
"Average bond, Daniel Craig is good as 007 but the movie just kind of dragged in many places. Needed more action.",negative
Daniel Craig is sex on legs and the movie was great aswell,positive
Daniel Craig! what`s more to say...,positive
Very good Bond I think... Waiting for the second part !,negative
"the best bond film ever. Great acting, good story.",positive
"This Bond takes you back to the Sean Connery fist fighting, rumble and bumble James Bond...It is the best",positive
"rivals the best of james bond. plus, it was realistic enough to watch... compared to brosnan's bs!",positive
Love the opening *_*!! And the story was really good too~,positive
daniel craig another one of my favurtei actors best bond yet in my own opinion my favourite film out f everythin daniel craig is also a legend best bnd film and one of the best films out of everything,positive
One of the best bond movie. Eva Green - hot!,positive
the nest bond in ages and much more realistic,positive
Craig is a cool dude.,positive
"The Best Bond movie, ever...",positive
The Only Bond Film I Have Seen And It Was A Good One,positive
The best Bond movie so far:),positive
Th eonly thing good about this movie is Daniel Craig...sorry not really a Bond fan.,negative
"only saw it once, and i fell asleep half way through...",negative
"Initially I was disappointed over Daniel being picked for Bond, but he left me completely awed with his performance. Possibly the second best Bond to date (next to Connery of course) EXCELLENT flick. I have seen all the Bond flicks and this one is my favorite.",positive
Rated 4.5 because i didnt expect it to be this good... didn't think it would be any good at all... Craig shows off the toughness of James Bond,positive
love it love it love it !!!!,positive
One of best films ever,positive
Daniel Craig as bond? anyway it was ok,negative
"Great film but painful to watch that lovely car getting wrecked, if he didn't want it I could have given it a good home.",positive
"Loved this movie, he did a great job establishing himself as Bond. They tied together a great way to explain why there are different James Bonds, not to mention he is just a brutal Bond. I especially love how they played off the love interest, and showed that even a Bond, loves his first love...even if she does betray him.",positive
Daniel Craig pulls it off. That's all I can say.,positive
"It was good, Craig is no doubt a brilliant actor! however i was expecting something a bit more, it felt a little disjointed. But i did like seeing a Bond that isn't perfect, it made the story much more believable. Craig 5/5",positive
James Bond as he should be! A must,positive
"Oooh, Daniel Craig . . need i say more?!",positive
ive only seen 2 bonds-so this kicks ASS,positive
"Best Bond movie in a long time, looking forward to the next installment.",positive
"Je ne suis pas fan de James Bond mais celui lÃ ...sympa! Pour une fois, ce n'est pas un gros macho!!!!",positive
"Critics initially slated Daniel Craig & then did a major u-turn, after Casino Royale was a box office hit!! Rugged & Fit well into the character.",positive
Worst Bond film ever.,negative
oooo you got too see his bum *blushes*,negative
"back to the old school, bond is back",positive
best bond movie ever!,positive
its just another 007 movie..........,negative
"Watch IT, Watch It, Watch it!",positive
Craig brings life back to Bond. Or was it Bond back to life?,positive
I don't care what people say. This guy was more Bond-esque than Pierce could ever be.,positive
Best Bond movie ever and I haven't finished watching it!! Daniel Craig is HOT!,positive
Different kind of bond movie,positive
"As for a Bond film, I enjoyed the grittiness. But still, nothing that new here.",negative
Easily the best Bond film ever made! i can watch this movie everyday and still find it exciting!,positive
Action packed! A new take on Bond and I like it!,positive
Thought Clive Owens would have been better but Daniel Craig won me over!,positive
He is definetly the best bond yet although I wish there were more gadgets,positive
"it didn't have the gadgetry that has been expected in previous films, but all around was a decent film to watch",negative
Best Bond movie I've seen. Daniel Craig is the Bond.,positive
eeeeehhhhhh. more realistic but too long and not enough casino,negative
Eva Green ... q mujer! jaja ... pero la pelicula tmb esta muy buena jajaja,positive
Love it. Drags a bit around the card game whih goes on wayyyyy too long but a great intorduction for a new bond.,negative
"Who needs gadgets? Daniel Craig shines in his first time as Bond with some great action scenes and of course, a kickass theme song from Chris Cornell. Must see.",positive
The name's Bond...James Bond. (Flippin' sweet!),positive
AMAZING. james bond. good stuff.,positive
buenisimo el viejoo.. jaja just kiddin jaja nee sta buenaa la moviie!!,positive
Great rebirth of the franchise.,positive
"How good was this movie??? Daniel Craig?? Well I was pretty worried that an actor that wasn't well known to play one of the biggest roles around as a James Bond. But must say I was very impressed with his acting as Bond. He brought out the more physical, willing to take risks, gangster type Bond and it worked well beyond my own expectations. Even more so than pierce brosnan coz I thought he was the best bond by far but now it's Daniel Craig great job mate!!! Great action and more of the wreckless style to spice up the new bond which worked really well. Instead of the yes my lady (being polite) and being a goodie 2 shoes. Makes Bond look lyk he's taking charge of what Bond wants 2 do rather than taking orders by MI-6. Just GreaT!!",positive
He looks so yummy in his blue bathing suit!,negative
Not one of the best Bond movie but Bond is more manly in this one,positive
"it was good, but i didn't like this bond",negative
James Bond is every man's mentor.,positive
Esta es la favorita de Juan,positive
More James Bond all the time...I think Daniel Craig has a lot of potential to bring Bond back from where Brosnan left it (in the dirt),positive
Great action movie. Lots of fun. Alot better then the Brosnan OO7 movies.,positive
Loved it. Best James Bond movie by far.,positive
Most faithful to Ian Fleming's James Bond character of the lot.,positive
"I saw it three times in theaters, and would see it many more, a perfectly done Bond movie to revive the series.",positive
Daniel Craig act damn cool!!!,positive
The job's done and the bitch is dead. - James Bond,positive
Better than most James Bonds,positive
Daniel Craig...need i say more?,positive
better than i expected very good movie,positive
Best Bond movie ever!,positive
"in the genre, my gosh. Even if I have critics to make, I won't. I take absolutely everything, starting with the man and his little finger.",positive
The only good bond movie,positive
James Bond films - love them. Daniel Craig in his trunks - perfect!!,positive
"A great first outing by Daniel Craig. The most physical Bond ever. His pre-movie critics should be eating their words by now. My wife didn;t like him - wasn't tall, dark and handsome - I wasn't offered the part.",positive
"Great reboot for Bond, and Craig kicks ass. Perfect plotting due to Fleming's novel, and a very classy final scene.",positive
"I was worried at frist when I heard about the new Bond, but Daniel Craig exceded my expectations. I loved the movie. It is one of my favorite Bonds ever.",positive
"Bond is back, and he's playing poker!",positive
"Good action, weak plot",negative
"Completely revitalises the Bond franchise. Craig is the new face of Bond. Possibly the best Bond movie to date, in my opinion.",positive
the only bond film i would have in my dvd collection,positive
The old bonds were good - this is great - an excellent move away from a comedy/action pick and into a good nitty gritty (yes I said it) dark fil that explores the persona of one of societies biggest heros,positive
So long old Bond!! Hello agent with balls.,positive
"A bizarre mix of 1960s and 2000s. Interesting, gritty and more realistic take on the Bond phenomena, and one worth seeing. 20 minutes too long though...",positive
i thought that craig did a good job as bond. it waw an absolute brutal movie and i thought that it was great. i liked how it had no gadgets. its a new concept but why not go back to the great action scenes that made action movies great.,positive
"Best Bond since Goldeneye, if not better",positive
"The first Ian Fleming book I ever read was this one, and as the Bond films came out, I realized how far the movies were from the terrific books. This is the first Bond movie which has the character development of the books, and I highly recommend.",positive
"A great bond film. Cool gritty feel, and good story. One of the best.",positive
Finally someone's read the book and worked out which movie they should be making. I loved Connery but he did his own thing - this is Fleming's 007.,positive
"One of my favorite Bond movies. Bond's relationship with Lynd seemed less superficial than the usual Bond girl, and I never would have believed that a poker game could be so exciting!",positive
Love the theme tune. Prob one of my favourite Bond films - apart from that one where he has the metal teeth and climbs across those ski lift thingys,positive
"True James Bond Fashion! Daniel Craig gets it where Pierce Brosnan just didn't have a clue. Smart, sexy, cpativating, I mean really, how easy is it to make playing a card game intriguing?!?",positive
A great re-invention of Bond. Craig is the best bond since Connery,positive
I love 007 movies. This one is one of the very best.,positive
This series needed a reboot.,negative
Best Bond so far... film-wise and actor-wise. Revitalised the Bond franchise in the best way possible.,positive
one of the best freakin james bond movies ever! they do need to work on the serial killer bond though.,positive
james bond is kickass.,positive
amazing action scenes,positive
"Smashing. The wife & I were going for Bourne but settled for Bond & found ourselves really enjoying this raw & brutish version. Plus it shows, once again, men just cannot trust women,",negative
"best james bond yet. daniel craig portrays the early bond, rough and crude, but subtley refined, to perfection like connery. definitely one of my favorites",positive
"Bond taken a serious step in the right direction. After Bosnin's films wound to a close I found my self not even compelled to watch them. I enjoyed golden eye and now the same director is back and proving his worth I went to an advanced preview to see this with my best friend. We agreed hands down it was fantastic. Realistic, gritty and Daniel Craig certainly suited his new role. Any Bond fan would be proud of this film although as my friend indicated it needed a nice long car chase. As there allready filming the follow on there may be car chases and more thrills to come.",positive
"Bond films might well have been saved! Yes there is a new Bond, but I think it's more that they've decided to 'add more realism' to the the genre. Still has its crazy moments but it wouldn't be Bond without them! All in all, near perfection for a Bond film! If there's a complaint... Not enough Aston Martin!!!",positive
"Best Bond in a long time, although maybe a little long. Might be one of those films that is even better the second time around!",positive
The only Bond movie I wasn't bored during,negative
best bond film ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Danel Craig is brilliant as 007,positive
"It has way too many endings, but it's still pretty awesome.",positive
good movie don't like 007 but this one made me think about watching the rest,positive
The only Bond I would like to have sex with.,positive
"To say I don't like James Bond, this isn't bad",negative
"This was the best Bond movie I've seen because this was the best Bond yet. Pierce Brosnan was a ninny and a gigolo, but Daniel Craig is ALL MAN.",positive
Thank fuck. They've got Bond right at last. No more pigeons doing a fucking double-take as gondalas speed past. Great film.,positive
Good but didn't seem up to normal 007 standard.,positive
"Daniel Craig plays a great Bond. To hell with anyone that says he is better than Connery, however. Other than his character being spot on, this movie didn't have much. I am confused as to how hardcore Bond fans even considered this a Bond movie. We were missing some serious character, gadget, chase and action scenes that remain a staple to Bond films. I felt like I was watching the world series of poker with a couple minutes of thematic dialog thrown in to break the tension of zooming in on everybody's poker face every 2 minutes.",negative
"Best Bond filck in a long, long time.",positive
"At last! A watchable Bond film. (Daniel Craig needs to stop puckering his lips for the next installment though, or he'll get himself stuck somewhere.)",positive
i love this bond movie. it has gone back to the story and the special effects are hardly noticed which makes this movie spectacular.,positive
Anybody got his phone number?,positive
"I really enjoyed his one. I think that it really brought out the character of James Bond in the begining and definately eexplained a lot of James bond to come. With some of the sequences being near impossible, I loved it for that reason.",positive
I'm not especially fond of the James Bond movies (I never understand the plot^^) but this one is pretty good!,negative
"The most realistic Bond film ever. Not just a bunch of special effects and poor acting. Plus you get the usual Bond stuff: beautiful women, beautiful cars and car chases, lots of gadgets. Best of all: He drives an Aston Martin again :)",positive
gr8.....my name is jay....jay punjai....i like this style....lol....,positive
James bond as we've never quite seen him. Not just your loveable bad-ass but a seriously cold hearted agent. The running man scene was a bit kitsch but it shows even the movies are affected by the youtube revolution - I still loved the scene though. Must see Apocolypto for more great on foot chase scenes,positive
Excellent Film! Bit long though!,positive
Best Bond film. EVER.,positive
"Ok, i thought that the action scenes in this film were quite good, but the poker game takes up about an hour and a half, and this to me got boring after a bit i wiill agree that daniel craig gave a good performance, but bond is about the action what happend to bond",negative
longest wrap up in history!,positive
Best modern Bond movie. I thought they should have played baccarat instead of texas holdem.,positive
"Tarkistin asian eilen DVD:lta: viisi tahtea rapsahtaa jo pelkasta sex appealista. Sen verran kulttuurista paaomaa yritan tassa kuitenkin kaapata, etta Daniel Craig oli h.koht. suosikki jo ennestaan. Our Friends in the North -tv-sarjasta varsinkin. --- Five stars for pure sex appeal. But - and this is important - I was of this opinion based on the jolly fine BBC series Our Friends in the North.",positive
Hott and action to the max on hotties all around. Bond is a little less womanizing in this film.,positive
soooo unrealistic... but overall it was okay..,negative
bond needs to get dirty more often,positive
Daniel Craig mocks his critics with a great performance as 007. This adventure is pulse-pounding as Bond is thrust into his first mission as a double-o.,positive
"Easily, easily the best Bond film. Superior even to Goldeneye, which was pretty damn good. Daniel Craig is superb, and this is the least kitschy of the franchise, which is probably one of its best selling points.",positive
"In my opinion it has potential to be the Best James Bond to date, and I'm a fanatic. Also just a really good movie in general.",positive
Good move casting Daniel Craig. I heard that he wants to do a full frontal in the next film. Right on.,positive
"Boring, the only thing I really enjoyed was the music",negative
An infusion of blood to the 007 franchise. Who says Bond can't be blonde? He's more Bond than 2/3rds the previous Bonds. Bond is a sexy thug again!,positive
One of the best James Bond movies I've seen. Daniel Craig nailed the part.,positive
"best bond film. fuck sean connery and his idiotic ""suave"" schtick. this is the real deal.",negative
This is one of the best bond films ever,positive
The best Bond movie I've watched.,positive
Best Bond since Goldeneye.,positive
phenomenal. daniel craig is a ballin bond.,positive
Now this is my kind of James Bond.,positive
Shows how 007 becomes Bond Jame Bond,positive
Have u seen his eyes!,positive
"Only recent Bond movie worth a damn. Take out that stupid defillibrator scene and it's even better. I'm glad it followed the book, however, I'd have liked them to play baccarat instead of the hick-ish American poker lol",positive
one of the best bond movies,negative
wow this guy was a good bond,positive
wasnt bad. My nuts hurt for a few days after the torture scene.,negative
I liked this...Bond wasn't as debonaire as usual...thank god...he was just there to get the job done...I wouldn't have trusted the girl though...i know better...I know that we are not to be trusted...,negative
"The best Bond movie since Goldeneye and possibly since the Connery films. Daniel Craig's performance echoes the cold-hearted nature of the Bond from the novels and not the campy, man-of-the-world Bond that Roger Moore epitomized. Avoids the over-the-top plot of most Bond flicks for a much realistic and compelling story. Only real flaw is that it was a mite too long.",positive
OMG! I LUVED THIS MOVIE SOO MUCH! BOND IS HOTT,positive
Great job updating bond into the 21st century,positive
Infinitely better than I thought it would be.,positive
"I absolutely loved this movie, it revived the James Bond series which took a decline in the last few years...",positive
never enjoyed a bond flick b4 this one...,positive
Amazing action movie I've seen from all bond movies. This was the best bond movie made. i must of seen it at least 20 times never gets old,positive
this man is hot like fire!!!,positive
Best Bond movie since GoldenEye. My second favorite ever after From Russia With Love,positive
Gets four stars because it's more loyal to Bond than most of its predecessors. It strips away the gadgets and relies on a character that easily captures our eyes on the screen while seamlessly blending into the crowd of the picture. Kudos to Craig for a great performance.,positive
This is the best Bond film I've ever seen. This Bond is the most realistic Bond as well.,positive
"amazing, craig brings Bond back to life and it's great to see a man sprint with such purpose! (can't imagine Brosnan sprinting so magnificently)",positive
best james bond movie ever,positive
"I was never a Bond fan, but thought this movie had promise. Wow. Was it the action, the darkness, the cool poker game, the free running, or the acting? ALL OF IT.",positive
"this aint no bond movie, is a daniel graig movie. doesnt have the charisma as brosnan",negative
Overtakes Goldeneye as the best bond film!,positive
i now refer to that style of swimsuit as the bond suit,negative
looks kinda creepy....,negative
"not my favorite bond yet, he's kind of rough around the edges rather than super suave. but shocking himself back to life with the aed and the aggressive walking was boss",positive
Good Bond film despite the blond Bond.,negative
Good film a must see.,positive
"I don't care if he is blonde, he did a fantastic job of portraying the James Bond character. Granted, he's no Sean Connery, but Craig is the next best Bond, I think.",positive
You think it's an action movie? It is a love story. And thumbs up for the spies who will roam the world with us till one of us finds an honest job.,positive
Best Bond film in ages.,positive
"Though Pierce Brosnan was an excellent Bond, his movies were among the worst of the Bond saga; seriously Die Another Day was so shitty that Tomorrow Never Dies is passable by comparison (also shitty). Daniel Craigh straight up Batman Begins the saga by adding a much darker, less jovial Bond, which doesn't sound good on paper but fucking works. This is easily the best Bond flick since For Your Eyes Only. Let's just hope that the same doesn't happen to Craig what happened to Brosnan (Goldeneye was Brosnan's first and last great film)",positive
"i actually liked this a lot. it was darker than the other 007s, but really cool!",positive
sweet. love james bond films,positive
"Any guy who can take a rope in the nuts like that has my respect, although some parts just weren't necessary (the plane, wtf?)",negative
"I'm not a huge Bond fan, but I do enjoy a good Bond movie. I was curious to see how this new Bond fit the role and I thought he was pretty good. I think Pierce Brosnan was one of the all-time best, so he has some big shoes to fill. This is definitely a different type of Bond, and I think it works. I don't think anyone is going to rank this Bond with any of the all-time greats, but is a welcome addition to the list of Bond actors. As for the movie, it was a pretty good movie too. The poker scenes kinda make the movie drag a bit...and the entire thing seemed to be about a half hour too long, but overall, it was pretty good. Some really cool action scenes.",negative
"Craig IS Bond...in my opinion second only to Connery (whom he obviously used as his model for this portrayal). great character development, great locals, limited use of cheesy gadgets, and a believable story with a realist villain...its about time",positive
sexiest Bond ever...,positive
best bond film i've ever seen,positive
This film made Bond great once again. Daniel Craig is Bond,positive
5 stars for an action movie..and b/c im obsessed,positive
The beginning of a new 007 agent. They brought the fira! It's hotness!!,positive
"My favorite Bond flick, besides 'Goldeneye'",positive
"I am not a huge fan of the Bond movies, but this movie takes the film series to a whole new level. Superb acting to go with a compelling script this movie definitely deserves your attention.",positive
"Sigh, finally a Bond movie that is not pathetic.........just like the old days",positive
The only James Bond I like.,positive
"my favourite bond yet, gritty new character. More fun than the old stuffiness",positive
"This just wasn't Bond to me. Not because he has Blonde hair and a bit of a craggy face,but because the bloke in the video shop put the wrong disc in the case and i ended up watching some film with Helen Mirren dressed as mary Queen of Scots.",negative
worst bond movie ever.,negative
"Amazing! The best Bond movie to date. Daniel Craig, wkd acting, wkd body. Marry me please! xxx",positive
Brought Bond back to reality,positive
"It might be the beginning, but its more of the same.",negative
I heard Casino Royale got rave reviews. Probably because of the first few minutes of the movie. The starting and somewhere till the 15th minute mark or so (I don't want to have to watch it again to check) were arguably the best in any Bond flick. Then the plot went to shyte. Then they brought in the Eva Green and we didn't care that the plot was dumb... but that Daniel and Eva sparked like a tesla coil when together. Then it gets lame as they try to bring the aforementioned ludicrous plot to bear. They realise this and attempt a rescue by unleashing a gritty torture scene. Then they get even lamer when they give her a lame farewell. And attempt another rescue when he kills someone again and strikes a cool pose. But by this time I don't care. The end. Summary: The movie was carried by the sheer acting ability of Craig and Eva. Nice wrapping. Shallow content.,negative
"A modern retelling of the original Bond film of the same name. Typical Bond; hot cars, killer fight scenes and amazing spy tech.",positive
really good! action packed and i love poker! perfect bond film!,positive
"Bond, better then most of the goofy ones but anyway you look at it bond is now kinda a classic, must see them all",negative
James Bond should always have been like this. Why did they make all those other movies?,positive
"Real James Bond for a change instead of Pierce ""My Ears"" Brosnan crap",positive
This is one of the best Bond movies ever. It's an original Fleming storyline which helps. Daniel Craig is awesome which I didn't expect him to be. It uses very little CGI and is very realistic compared to the latter Brosnan efforts. It's noticeably more gritty and realistic which was a pleasant change.,positive
"The 5th best Bond film and truly a great Bond epic! It's very faithful to Ian Flamings's first Bond novel, and that's one of its' main strengths actually (even though he wrote it way back in 1952!) Daniel Craig makes for a pretty realistic 007 and that's extremly welcome after Moore and Brosnans more humoristic approach to the role. One of the best 5 Bond films.",positive
"Bond is back, and kicking ass!",negative
"Une renaissance pour ce hÃ©ros, trÃ¨s influencÃ©e par les diffÃ©rent ""Bourne movies"". Mais en attendant, un grand plaisir, et de bons acteurs...",positive
One of the best Bond films to date. Daniel Craig adds a new meaner dimension to the character,positive
Not convinced by Daniel Craig! Didn't think the bond girl was sexy enough either!,negative
One of the best Bonds.,positive
loved it! daniel craig is well fit,positive
I loved the new style of this film. The older movies felt very tired. Good story too.,negative
"I love most Bond films, but he is just not Bond..",negative
"The best Bond movie yet, although I miss Sean Connery and Roger Moore",positive
"Finally, a gritty Bond worthy of the name.",positive
i'll smack anyone who says Craig didnt do an amazing ass job as a bamf Bond,positive
My Favorite! He is such a good James Bond!,positive
"daniel craig is awsome as the new bond, dashing, witty and deadly as all bonds should be",positive
"Good remake. Very nice looking new 007. Action, romance and all that jazz.",negative
the most realistic Bond yet... but I still don't think that he was the best one.,negative
Please marry me Daniel Craig.,positive
daniel craig... so hot...,positive
"Good movie, loses it a little in the middle but the ending is great, a little bit to much of a love story for Bond tho.",negative
The coolest movie ever!!!,positive
At first when I saw all the movie trailers and previews for this movie I thought Daniel Craig would suck. I was soooo wrong. This movie was entertaining despite not using the usual high-tech gadgets and explosions. I loved the movie and can't wait for the next one with Daniel Craig.,positive
"For my money, the best Bond movie ever made. This should be a model for future Bond films and action films in general.",positive
love this hottie Daniel Craig<3,positive
"Oh. My. God. Craig is the perfect actor for the direction the series wants to go. Connery, Lazenby, Moore, Dalton, Brosnan, and now Craig. They all brought something original to the series and it's the reason why the series has lasted so long.",positive
"this new james bond killed it for me. He totally sucked at playing James Bond. It was a good action movie, but as I said.. it wasn't a James Bond movie. They really needed to keep Pierce. He wanted to play the part again and he would have done a good job and not complained about it likke this other a** did.",negative
"Great action with good pace, to start with. Plot slows right down with the poker game which proves to be an endurance test for bond (and the audience). After that the plot is less than satisfying but the film is redeemed by the superb characters and acting. I wonder how it can be set after the cold war and still be in keeping with the series?",negative
Interesting movie! Lots of intense moments! A cool thriller!,negative
first half awesome second half su-ucked a over dramatic card game and then some romance stuff. The Venice scene did not even begin to make up for it.,negative
"Entertaining, but not a Bond film in the usual sense.",negative
"I don't care what anyone says Daniel Craif, did a great job, and everyone else is just jealous they didnt get the part",positive
The poker scene rocks,negative
"Double-edged sword. The perfect Bond film - but has made all that has gone before, with the exception of the early Connerys and OHMS, pale by comparison and, as a result, Christmas could be ruined forever.",positive
"Woohoo Poker baby! Okay, I'd say Daniel Craig did very well in his first role as the new James Bond. The action in the movie was quite good, but I had two disappointments. Firstly, the Aston-Martin he drives was shown for maybe ten seconds the entire movie. Secondly, the movie dragged on for too long, only to abruptly end when you weren't actually expecting it. Overall, this is a good film that's worth watching.",positive
"It is centrally the media's fault that ""Casino Royale"" will go down as one of the great ironies in filmaking within this century. I cannot remember whether there had been a more flopsided opinion on a movie from pre-production to its final printing that served as such raid to its making. Everyone KNEW Brosnan was the man in the tux - the version of a killer that, when in trouble, called the brigades after falling in the mud. Also, people ASSUMED that Bond could not live without the underlying fact that the man was a germaphobe, a person who kills in cold blood with invisible gloves to protect his hands. Bronsnan was that man and he was great because the fantasy element of Bond being almost impenatrable left us to gawk at him. When Daniel Craig was cast, nobody knew who he was but they did know he was a blond, buff baffoon that looked more chiseled than the statue of David. In essence, Hercules is not James Bond. Yet they did not know, as filming came and went, that Craig had something slipped up his tux that would solidify him as being one of the very best Bonds ever. His take: to get beaten into oblivion and look as mangly as possible while doing so; or, for those who caught it, to be a real man who uses the cars and guns as a means of escape, not flash. Connery, Moore and Brosnan used high tech gagetry to elude capture and death: Craig runs through a brick wall. The man is a tank but let that not avert your attention to the all too clear reason why his Bond is the true 00. A ""blunt instrument,"" as Judi Dench's M likes to reference him as, does not appear out of thin air but gradually becomes his and his enemies worst enemy over time, with diligence and determination. What does this do to a man? How can he live a life that requires him to kill? Craig elaborates on the question(s) with British wit not seen since Connery almost to make it out as a joke but never to single it out as one. The director of this picture, Martin Campbell, I hope, returns to Bond before his career ends because he is the most capable of handlers for the Bond material. When he was directing Brosnan he added a layer of cool to him not seen before. When he redebuted Bond again, with a zing in Craig, he made him a tool to be bludgered again and again, offing the original notion that Bond is Superman and shoving in our faces the exact opposite: that the man can bleed just like us. This and the addition of a Bond girl that has brains over boobs (a surprise but a welcome one for you scholars out there) sat the series in a new chair that somehow seems reinvigorated, fresh and new. Bond is born again only to face death in more occasions than ever.",positive
UGH. Daniel Craig was great but the rest of the film was one long poker match.,negative
"Daniel Craig rocks as bond. Good looking, sexy, dark and not as corny as previous Bonds.",negative
It is above and beyond what I expected. Daniel Craig's perfect portrayal of 007 is the icing on one kickass cake.,positive
Greatest Bond film by far.,positive
"I would lick every part of Eva Green, is she would let me.",positive
"The film that finally restores bond to it's rightful place, as the ultimate high-tech action thriller (in spite of the fact that a good bit of it is actually set around a poker table.) Enjoyable, if a bit too overlong.",positive
The way Bonds should really be.,positive
we talked through a bit of it but what I did pick up was good.......I think he was as good of a Bond as I've seen but has the advantage of time and better movie productions on his side...as far as the fights though he is the best regardless,positive
New Bond; Best Bond!,positive
FAb film for all women...how sexy is Daniel,positive
i enjoyed Bond-he fit the part fine--entertaining-a good mix of intrigue.,negative
"Fantastic - griping, funny, I cried when the aston rolled. DC = sex on legs",positive
"Great Bond, I was sick of Brosnan...",positive
Best Bond film ever made,positive
"Worst bond film made, The original casino Royale was better. There was a reason Brosnan said no to it after looking at the script. The movie was way to drawn out, should have ended an hour earlier. I was a big time Bond fan, this movie was a huge disapiontment",negative
"Worst bond film made, The original casino Royale was better. There was a reason Brosnan said no to it after looking at the script. The movie was way to drawn out, should have ended an hour earlier. I was a big time Bond fan, this movie was a huge disapiontment",negative
"After reading the book, I know now that Daniel Craig is the closest thing to the actual Ian Flemming Bond character than any one of the actors. The movie is not bad, either, but it's Craig that made it awesome.",positive
"All I can say is that Daniel Craig is the future of OO7, and I couldn't be happier. My favorite Ian Fleming Novel and this adaptation fails to disappoint. Really shows the dark side of Bond that was lost from the previous Bond films, but important to the character development in the books.",positive
"I wish Daniel Craig was taller,then he would be perfect. Grat movie, especially the love stry. Some depth in a James Bond script. NICE",positive
"Well it's about time! Superb Bond movie. Daniel Craig makes Bond believeable, some clever homages made to earlier Bonds. Tough, gritty and plenty of action.",positive
"too long, seemed like the end would never come.",negative
i hate the new guy bring back pierce no where near as good as the other bonds >:(,negative
Awesome! Fight scenes so real....,positive
best bond so far in my opinion. Daniel craig is so good,positive
Better than i thought it was going to be,negative
All I need to say is the swim trunks scene...,positive
i prefer pierce brosnan >.>,positive
"reignites the Bond films, Daniel Craig is the best bond yet, in my opinion.",positive
"Not flawless as a film, but exceptional as a bond adaptation - suffers from varying pacing problems and Daniel Craig alternating between ""best Bond"" and just bearable - but some spectacular set pieces, a very tense series of Poker games and some awesomely tactless product placement make this the most impressive offering since Goldeneye.",positive
"mint, think i may take up poker!! craig pisses on all the other bonds except for connery, obviously.",positive
All best Bond so far after Sean C's ones.. Truly reflect young Bond's mentality,positive
"My favorite bond of all time, as long as you keep an open mind about it and throw away all knowledge of the other bonds away. It's not as hard as you may think to do that!",positive
"daniel craigs first outing as bond, a good way of making a first impression. Tight blue trunks!!",positive
"I was sceptical, then I saw Casino Royale. It kept me watching all the way through, despite not being a true Bond film (not until the last 30secs that is!) and the action is well done. Craig becomes Bond from the moment he slips the tux on, and Eva Green is a huge find. Highly recommended.",positive
An exceptional Bond adventure that gets rid of the rediculous gadgets and strips Bond down to his human self again. One of the best!,positive
"One of the best bond, right , more darkness into the bond's body, more complexity, and also feelings (with ava moore), BUT especially no more Useless things (such as the gadgets and all the brands : bmw, rolex, ....)",positive
"I was a Pierce Brosnan fan only until I saw this movie, a great re-introduction to James Bond. Daniel Craig is a brilliant actor.",positive
Daniel Craig is good...but it was not the best Bond film...,negative
"Well, after all Ive heard about him being a bad bond. Daniel Craig exceeds expectations and shows what bond should really be like. This film never verges on the endge of daftness like the previous installments bringing with it a realistic Bond/Spy. For that resons alone its a better thought out film. Although in saying that, it doesnt feel like a bond film. But that in itself is no bad thing",negative
craig is a shit bond,negative
"It started off very good seemed to be the never ending movie, what with turning into a romance and then into an action thriller in the last ten mintues of the film...",negative
"A reassuring move away from sarcasm, brilliant revival for the Fleming canon.",positive
The best Bond-movie. Daniel Craig is excellent in the lead role.,positive
"i like bond, Mads mikkelsen is brilliant.",positive
bond in a different style...nice,negative
James Bond is the shit.,positive
"The best Bond film in a long, long time. It's just a really good movie all around.",positive
Fast fantastic fabulous,positive
"My fav Bond film and fav Bond actor. the freerunning scene sealed the deal right up front and bond playing poker, fighting badguys, consoling girl, losing poker, getting back in, being poisoned, surviving poison and coming back to win it all (and all in a tux!) in that 40 minute time span was action movie GOLD.",positive
"I don't usually like Bond movies but this is an exception. Entertaining to watch. ps. Loistavimpia takaa-ajoja, mitä olen nähnyt (ilman autoja)!",positive
The best Bond since early Sean Connery days.,positive
"the intro with the parkour exhibition by one of parkour's very founders, from what i hear, is great! the truck fight soon after? almost a take-by-take copy from the truck scenes from transporter, so boo for that lack of originality. the rest was slow and typical bond of over the top when it does get rolling again. the two stars are for the parkour.",negative
"Bond is always Bond, but with Daniel Craig it can´t possibly get any better ;)",positive
"I like Daniel Craig,but Pierce Brosnan is still the best.Apparently, it is one of the most romantic movie I have recently seen.",positive
Probably the best Bond movie in 20 years,positive
"Great action. Great acting. Kept me guessing. Plus, its beautiful (the people and the scenery).",negative
This is a FANTASTIC addition to the series.,negative
Ive been a Bond fan all of my life (really) and thi one is by far my favorite.,positive
Best Bond Movie So Far,positive
"Reset of the Bond Series. Could be the best Bond so far, the Jury is still out on this one. Personal Favorite after the Connery movies.",positive
"Pretty good Bond flick, but needs less whining",positive
One of the greatest spy movies ever made. It saved the Bond franchise from a downward spiral of campiness. It did something that I didn't think could be done: it made James Bond cool again.,positive
Best bond film since Russia With Love,positive
This was one of the best James Bond movies i have seen. He will go down as one of the BEST,positive
"2 harsh, where is p.brosnen?????",negative
"Bond reborn. Had big fears about this one with Craig replacing Brosnan, and even though the character lost its british touch, the new bond is smart yet explosive. Love the more dark and realistic way the bond series is taking.",positive
My role model. Daniel Craig is the best bond in the franchise history.,positive
"Too bad it came around with ""300"" ,other wise it, Movie of the Year. The best James Bond ever.",positive
first bond movie I have liked....hello Daniel Craig!!,positive
The best 007 is Daniel Craig,negative
Best Bond movie since Sean Connery!,positive
"I'm still trying to get used to Craig, but he did a good job. There is no such thing as a bad bond movie. I did miss the toilet paper tube thing they used to do at the beginning.",positive
"Now this is what 007 should be like, a true and believable work by the best bond in the making..and wow what a car!!",positive
This was by far my favourite Bond movie. Funniest torture scene ever.,negative
"Only watched this because Darren is a huge Bond fan and we got free tickets, but it wasn't too bad.",negative
Not bad...interesting to see how it all started.,positive
Best bond since Connery. Mhm.,negative
This is THE Bond movie. Daniel Craig is incredible - especially in the unfeasibly athletic chase scene which opens the movie.,negative
"Best Yet! Daniel Craig is by far the best Bond! Great story, well acted and I love that we get to see what made Bond such a detached person emotionally... beautiful locations too.",positive
I turned it off before the end of the movie.,negative
The best Bond movie ever made. Hands down.,positive
"very good. suprised me since I was expecting rubbish, but i really liked this type of bond.",positive
"Best Bond film in years. Daniel Craig takes the iconic role and makes James a sympathetic, nuanced, three-dimensional character. The action is very efficient (especially a furious chase early on in the film) and the plot conforms to logic. The card game showdown is kind of anti-climactic, but the gritty new direction Bond seems to be taking is a welcome recharge to the franchise. What a recharge, indeed",positive
"yeh, this was pretty stinkin good. no sex scenes... all action, which pretty much rocked. super good action scenes too.",positive
I really loved this. It had everything.,positive
Very good movie. The OST is pretty good too. Non-stop action and the poker game was intense! Very good.,positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery.,negative
"best bond film in a while, i couldnt understand why he kept trying to save that bitch that stabbed him in the back",positive
best bond movie i have ever seen,positive
You still can't beat Sean but Daniel Craig comes a close second.,positive
Very well done in all aspects of the movie. A must see for all Bond fans.,positive
por favor NO MAS BOND !,negative
A great character-driven Bond film.,positive
One of the best Bonds.,positive
another film i luv! ive always liked james bond films n this is 1 of the best! esp. daniel craig :P,positive
Skummaste Bond-filmen hittils... och garanterat top 5 i bondgenren.,negative
"Wow, this is a bond movie? It was really really well done.",positive
"Ending was weak, but the rest was awesome.",positive
the only james bond movie worth seeing; absolutely stellar,positive
Daniel Craig brings a new edge to Bond that was seriously needed.,positive
"Pretty good- grittier than older Bond films, which I thought was something of a disadvantage, considering people have certain expectations as to what a Bond film should be. A bit too much gratuitous violence for my taste.",negative
"well executed and well planned, especially for being one of many 007 movies. by far my favortie one. Craig is perfect as Bond.",positive
"I love Bond, own all the movies, have a freak brother who can spout them in alphabetical, directorial, release year, and Bond actor order. So I can definitively say this one is great!",positive
One of the better Bond films since way back.,negative
Bond as it should be - not with a male model and a disappearing car. That was just f***ing stupid,positive
A marvellous modernisation,positive
"Daniel Craig proved the haters he was actually Bond. Die Another Day was like a point with no return. It was so sci-fi gadgetry you actually didnt believe in the story any more. So, a new beginning was needed. And hell of a good beginning they delivered. You actually can tell there is character development. Bond is not the same at the beginning, than at the end. And I dare to say there will be even more development in the next movie. He is not James Bond yet. He is just cold blooded assasin making his own way to be Bond, James Bond. Lol (:",positive
"Didn't give Daniel Craig any stick before I had watched it unlike alot of people, and I was rewarded. Back to basics bond and the result was a gritty and believeable bond film that was up there with the best.",positive
"A good start to reboot the franchise, but still a flawed film. Daniel Craig is an excellent choice for Bond; he has the Sean Connery ruggedness that's been missing for years. I really believed this guy could beat the crap out of a bad guy; instead of being a lounge singer with gadgets, he's actually an interesting character again. But the problems here are pretty glaring: first off, the villain needs to do more than play poker and cry blood. Second of all, the film needed to cut off around 30 minutes. Like I said, it's a good start, and hopefully the problems will be noted and addressed in future installments.",negative
"Certainly a good film. And not that Daniel Craig is a bad Bond but he's failing to live up to my expectations, maybe Pierce Brosnan set his standards too high. Though the story is good it almost doesnt qualify as a Bond film, Martin Campbell is breaking the rules and someone needs to stop him before he completely destroys the image of Bond! The excuse that this is the 'first in the series' will stop working if the next film is anything like Casino Royale as opposed to Goldeneye.",negative
"Not bad! Good action.. was disappointed that he fell in love... hum, this is not suppose to be James's character. Oh well!",positive
The real Bond is back! After a few bad movies the kind of Bond movie I like returns.,positive
Now i know who i want to be!,positive
Better than expected,positive
Not quite the comeback for Bond it was made out to be.,negative
One of the better Bond movies. Crazy amounts of action.,positive
"Honestly, a heck of a lot better than I expected it to be.",positive
"The same old bond cliches re-hashed with more modern action sequences and less sci-fi gadgetry. The problem is, Austin Powers has made this whole super-spy vs super-villain stuff look a bit ridiculous. Consequently Casino Royale plays like a spoof, only not funny. It's far too long too - there is some action, but there's also an awful amount of watching people playing cards, which isn't so riveting. I was quite excited about an ""updated Bond"". Casino Royale was thoroughly disappointing. I like David Arnold's score though. And Daniel Craig is pretty hunky. They can have one star each.",negative
Un des meilleurs James Bond! Daniel Craig fait vite oublier Pierce Brosnan,positive
"non-stop action from beginning to end, would have given it 5 stars if Daniel Craig stopped pouting as much.",positive
"Lots of drama, less gadgety, realism high.At times slow, but makes it more dramatic.Craig=Excellent.",positive
Poor stroy line......,negative
This is not James Bond. Cool tho. Just Not James Bond.,negative
I came into this movie thinking it was going to stink because of the lead role change but I was proved very wrong. Craig did a superb job and the film was awesome.,negative
"The tag line ""Bond is back"" suited this film as the ones before it were pretty rubbish. This however starts from the basics, sieves off useless scenes/gadets and gets down to a good spy/action flick. I've never seen a card game in a film better done than this. I do however not approve of the fact that they claim to have bond in Madagascar when it blatantly isn't.",positive
The new bond in it was awesome.,positive
Only saw a bit of this and i didn't think it was very good.,negative
"Best Bond since Connery, Best Bond Film since Live and Let Die",positive
love daniel craig as the new james bond,positive
I've never been very fond of Bond movies but I think this is one of the best 007-movies ever made...,positive
"Maybe the best Bond move of all time. Craig captures the essence of 007, even if he does not capture his hair!",positive
"In my opinion, the best Bond movie to date.",positive
"New Start for Bond, Definitely past the hackneyed Roger Moore period",positive
"I really liked this movie. Even for a bond movie. the last few didn't interest me very much, if at all, but this one was very good. It did follow the laws of physics better than its predecessors and actually one of the best action movies in that regard. Over all good story line and fairly good acting, with bond even showing some emotion.",positive
i've never seen James Bond take such a beating in my life.,positive
EVA GREEENNN!!!! GIVE IT TO ME,negative
"Hardcore, intense, action packed! Completely loved this movie.",positive
this is the best movie i have ever seen,positive
"I wasn't sure about Daniel Craig as Bond (Blond for a start!) but I thought this film was fantastic. Excellent actions scenes, amazing locations, great story... Can't fault it. Bring on the next one! I give this film the rating of 'Copa de Bosca'.",positive
"DUUUUUUUUDE....this is what Bond should always have been. A great, modern, and badass reinvention of an icon. Danny Craig is the best Bond of them all....except for Sean Connery of course. A great look into how Bond became who he is. But the most important thing, he's the most believable Bond, trading overwelming debonar for rugged toughness, still accentuated with elements of suave.",positive
"It's wrong to say 'Best Bond Ever' at this point, but give it one more film and there might not be any doubt left. Brilliantly brutal and flawed, Daniel Craig's Bond is unlike any of his predecessors. Avoiding many of the usual clichés, the film is almost perfect from start to finish.",positive
the best bond since george lazenby,positive
"Apparently there are many out there who think Daniel Craig is not good-looking enough to play Bond. Well you're all wrong. I've seen a few 007 movies in the past and can't say I enjoyed all of them. This one, I kind of did. It's worth watching just to check out the new Mr. Bond.",positive
"I love pretty much all the Bond movies, especially this one. This move deffinitely revitalised the Bond series from extinction",positive
Pretty good Bond movie - one of the better ones.,positive
Best Bond film in years...maybe ever,positive
Best Bond film I've seen. Daniel Craig beats Pierce Brosnan's Bond by a mile. This movie made me a Bond fan all over again.,positive
"Best Bond movie yet. Much more raw and ruthless than the other ""drinking gentleman"" Bonds and much more believable...",positive
"Welcome back, Mr Bond.",positive
"What else can I say? I've always wanted to like James Bond. I appreciate the iconic nature of the character and all the fun stuff that goes with him. But the last, uh, forty years worth of movies have been so dreadful that I was forced to ignore them. Here, though, we finally have a lean, intense, restrained but still stylized spy movie featuring, yep, the best Bond since Connery. The movie walks a fine line, managing to be more over-the-top than, say, the Bourne films, but avoiding the ridiculousness that tainted the Brosnan years. It also gives Bond an actual personality, and ends on a note that promises actual character development. If the next movie screws this up, there are going to be a lot of angry people out there...",positive
"My fav of the bond movies. I'm not an avid fan, so that doesn't mean much. But the comedy, action, and character interaction work well.",positive
This movie bored me so much. And Daniel Craig looks too much like Mr. Roper for me to take seriously.,negative
WOW! Great Bond movie! This is the spark that's going to light the fire of a great new age of Bond films.,positive
One of the best Bond's i've seen!,positive
Belle effort mais...,negative
Best James Bond ever!,positive
I am a big Bond fan. Shows how Bond became the Bond we know.,positive
"Exactly as I thought before seeing it, a good action flick that breaks the traditional feel of a bond movie. -1 star for predictability and breaking something that wasn't broke.",positive
"Of all the reboots/re-imaginings of popular franchises we've seen in the last 15 years or so, this may be the best. It breaks the James Bond character down in interesting ways and then rebuilds him by focusing on the most basic elements of the character but without too much pandering fan service. There's been other great Bonds and other great Bond women, but none have had the electric chemistry of Craig and Green.",positive
"Very serious and high brow Bond that harks back to the olden days, wasnt afraid to pull a few punches on you neither, just hope the next film can be as up to snuff since it wont actually be based on a Fleming novel",positive
"Was a good one, never got boring...BUT poker? hmm..",positive
"nicely close to the book, with a hard edge the other films lacked. unfortunately it's rumoured the next film is going to have a lighter feel to it, which probably means they'll undo all the good work and go back to regular film Bond (I hope it's not the case)",positive
can't they find a younger 007?,negative
"Very good film....and Daniel Craig is amazing! Again, I so would!! ;o)",positive
"Bond is back and better than ever, finally A Bond as dark and dangerous as Dalton",positive
Bond at it's best. Good choice of bond.,positive
This movie resurrects the Bond franchise from near death into something completely fresh and exciting. Sets up 007 for ten more years.,positive
"Me like,not the classic bond shwong to it but hey, times change.",positive
"Beautiful action scenes and nice woman, nice clothing, cool cars. But I still not convinced that Daniel is 007. He is too tough, I think he should be more convincing to act as a KGB agent.",negative
"The first 2/3rds of the movie is excellent, absolutely LOVED the first 30mins, but it lost something towards the end. But still pretty darn good. And Daniel Craig is a great Bond.",positive
Best Bond Film.. Bond was bad assed.. just minus half a star cuz hes Ugly.,positive
"A dark James Bond, a really good one since ages...",positive
Best bond film in a long while,positive
The stunt action was amazing! This one Bond film was a lot more violent then previous versions and was slightly slow. Bond is more of a hot-head in this one.,positive
amazing bond movie one of the best,positive
Daniel Craig is surprisingly magnificent in this back-to-basics Bond re-imagining. Great movie.,positive
All for Daniel Craig!,positive
Here's something a Bond movie hasn't been for years: a spy thriller.,positive
Great movie...old school Bond,positive
"The best of all the Bond films,down to earth and believable. Craig portrays Bond how Bond should be; ruthless and violent",positive
The best Bond yet! Amazing fight scenes.,positive
i think i got a new favorite bond actor.. love how he did in this movie.. great story too,positive
Daniel Craig is superb as 007.,positive
"Now, I've only seen this once, but I just bought it on DVD and I can't wait to see it again. Daniel Craig is very convincing as Bond and it lives up to the hype.",negative
"The series jumped to another new era~~ entertaining, but lack of James Bond elements~ Daniel Craig acts well, out of my expectation~!",negative
"Daniel craig is the best bond in a long while, he brings a new change to the character that was required for the series to continue.",positive
Daniel Criag is the best Bond since Connery. I only hope that the next film can emulate this one. Fantastic.,positive
"Sid James is James Bond. Whilst that initially sounds catty, it's actually more of a backhanded compliment as not only was Sid a bit of a rough diamond but also quite the ladies man in his day, traits which equally apply to Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond at the start of this movie. So there. As Bond movies go this is OK, but it only gets an average score as every other ""debut"" movie (Dr No, OHMSS, Live And Let Die, The Living Daylights and Goldeneye) is better than this in my humble(!) opinion. That said, the role is obviously Craig's for as long as he wants it.",negative
A very interesting look at what makes James Bond the man we are all familiar with. Daniel Craig is amazing and Eva Green is stunning.,positive
Great High Stake Poker scene!,negative
Great James Bond movie..Daniel Craig is excellent as James Bond!,positive
WOW all I can say is WOW,positive
"The film shows a haunted and intense performance by Craig that the other 007 bond films forgot. The film has the action, the thrills and the story.",negative
Best bond ever. So well done.,positive
One of the best Bond films. And my GOD Vesper is gorgeous. GORGEOUS I tell you!,positive
very cool-and love daniel craig!,positive
Daniel Craig is a good Bond no matter what anyone says. Particularly like the beginning chase on the building site,positive
new JAMES BOND. still fantastic.,positive
Not as good as I expected but still a B+,positive
I really liked this flick except for the romantic storyline that just bored the living daylights out of me through the middle of the film. They shouldn't have trashed that car either. Still highly recommended.,positive
"the best Bond film for a long while, and this Bond is quite believable. I love the reverse homage to Ursula Andresse getting out the water in Dr No....",positive
"Awesome movie!! It really brought Bond's character back from the books, he's actually a really badass guy in these movies. Great fight scenes, plot twists, and casting. I loved Judi Dench as M.",positive
"i'm not a James Bond fan but this one - I loved - great action, great story and sentimentality",positive
"Best James Bond movie till now. Its a back to the basics and most of all, another way of seeing the ""007 world"". Excellent!",positive
awesome! dan craig is the best bond yet,positive
"One of the best bond movies ever. Daniel Craig was outstanding as Bond, much better than I thought he would be.",positive
Probably the best bond movie ever,positive
good a change from piecer bronson,negative
Daniel Craig - HOT HOT HOT,positive
still not convinced he is the right bond,negative
"Good Bond movie, better than the last few. Be interesting to see where it goes from here.",negative
James Bond is so different. haha. but he's equally hot! love his bod! (:,negative
"I have never been a Bond fan...but this is reat. Visually stunning, gritty, incedibly fast. Daniel Craig finally makes Bond human, and not some daft cliche.",positive
best james bond ever,positive
YES! How do you apply to be a spy? I guess if you have to ask it's not a good start...,positive
"""Shaken or stirred? Does it look like i give a shit!"" Quality!",positive
It's all about Daniel .. mmm..best Bond ever!,negative
A proper Bond movie.,positive
"Why does Daniel Craig keep making ""blue steel""?",negative
Really good quite smart with a good deal of action.,positive
A great action movie. Daniel Craig does a good job of acting like an inexperienced double agent,positive
He is Just tooo dam sexy!,negative
"v sceptical to begin without, however this is a back to basics bond movie, proper style and what a bond movie should be",positive
"Its a bond film, I love em all",positive
Daniel Craig is modern day Bond. Very manly. But my favourite is his car Aston Martin DBS. The extra half star is for that reason,negative
Greatest of all Bond Movies!,positive
Best Bond movie ever!,positive
The best truly brute force James Bond film in years...arguably as good or better than Connery,positive
This Bond kicked ass,positive
"no flying cars, no i-can-kill-you-with-laser-from -my-Omega, no Q and no one-liner blatant jokes...Daniel Craig is James Bond, suave and deadly..the real motherfucker",positive
"v cool, v smooth, v real, v bond",positive
This is the first Bond's film I think is cool.,negative
I thought Daniel Craig did an awesome job! I'm still mad about the girl in the end though.,positive
Best bloody Bond movie to date.,positive
"Recycling the Bond stories with a new star, new M, new card game (in book it was Bacarrat) and new electronic gizmos - the delectable Eva Green and her beautiful eyes persuaded me to rate it 3.5 stars",negative
Best Bond movie so far,positive
"the best James Bond yet--it is more believable than the earlier ones, even Connery. You can feel the cold war in this one, and the idea of bad good man is very much brought to bear with all the conflict that entails internally.",positive
Lame. Ruined everything that made bond cool. No kudos here.,negative
Gorgeous new Bond. am most pleased,positive
"People went crazy for this movie... why? It's a good action movie, it's better than the recent Bond movies, but big deal... it's still way too long and repetitive.",negative
It's a fundamental in a friend. Is Casino Royale the best Bond? Yes? You can come in. No? Move that fat ass out of my sight!,positive
The best Bond film in many years. Craig is extremely convincing and Green was off the charts hot.,positive
It was quite a good movie. Daniel Craig did an awesome job as Bond.,positive
Great prequel gives good insight to the Bond Psyche...,negative
-DUUDDDEEE! Worth it for the Parkour chase through the construction site! Or watch it on youtube!,positive
best bond movie ever,positive
howa da ba2a a7la film shofto fe 7ayati,positive
"The best James Bond, and the Best James Bond movie",positive
i watched it but did not really know what was going on. mainly because i wasn't really pay any attention and i don't like bond.,negative
best bond ever .. watched it on blu-ray excellent..,positive
my personal favorite bond film. from 1995 onwards,positive
"i was suspicious, but this might be the best Bond ever!",positive
The triumphant return of Bond after the gadget-riddled Pierce Brosnan. Daniel Craig brought Bond back from the brink of ridiculousness that I didn't even realize Bond was at.,positive
"The name's Bond, James Bond.",positive
"I'm glad for two things:1) This came after the crappy Die Another Day, and 2) The long wait was worth it. I'm glad Daniel Craig is the new bond, he may not look like bond, but he sure as hell sells you better than the others.",negative
"Not a fan. It's not difficult to keep my attention, yet this... didn't. I miss Connery. <3, Sean. <3.",negative
"this movie is quite literally the most incredible film of 2006, well it was for me and tania! loveage... i think so xx",positive
i like this movie a little,negative
"I have to accept that it was a nice attempt of having JB reborned, although it is filled with action and a relatively good plot, the whole structure comes crumbling down like a pack of cards down to a redunctant and boring ending which took the whole exitement from the last hour and trashed it with your popcorns in your way out. It is indeed a very good concept of reinventing the character and bringing this realism to it (sor of like Nolan with Batman) but for goodness sake try to keep up the suspense and don't blow it up like that beautiful car.",negative
I will go on record to say this is the best Bond movie ever! Better than any f the older films. I've seen very few films as well made as this!,positive
"From the second I saw this movie poster I knew it was what I had been waiting for from a James Bond film. Daniel Craig and Mads Mikkelsen could not have been more perfect, and the movie didnt resort to overboard explosions and unfunny quips like the last few. Really the poster says it all.",positive
I really liked this one. It was a little dark but I thought it was a nice break from the same old same old!,positive
Best 007 no matter what my bro says.,positive
"Shoot, this was pretty frickin awesome! No cursing at all!",positive
Danial Craig was a pretty good Bond. Good flick.,positive
Great Bond movie. Takes away all the dumb gadgets and unrealistic action. Eva Green is one of the hottest women alive. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery.,positive
"Excellent film, a true Bond movie",positive
only good thing in this one is you now know how to make a JB007 Martini,negative
Passer han egentlig til å være James Bond???,negative
Oddly the torture scene is one of my favorite parts.,positive
it was a no win situation for craig on this one but i thought he did a pretty good job with all the stunts and chase scenes. Craig deserves a bit more credit in this film than what he actually got.,negative
Is this THE BEST Bond Movie ever?? Very very very close.,positive
wasn't really bond now was it? still good though.,negative
"Surprisingly good, didn't expect Daniel Craig, a.k.a bloody James Bond to be this good.",positive
the only bond movie i liked....,negative
"Best Bond in a long, long time!",positive
"Funny, lots of action...really good!",positive
pretty good. should have ended a half hour earlier.,negative
"Bond as a dull, clumsy thug. Paul Haggis is a hack that ruins everything he touches. Plus the last 45min are slow and tacked on.",negative
"A beautifully re-invented James Bond for the 21st century, who has more in common with Jason Bourne than Pierce Brosnan's previous portrayal of the same character. This Bond deals out hardcore pain and death, but he's nowhere near the smirking pretty boy who never gets a scratch that some previous Bonds have been. He spends a LOT of time cleaning his own blood off himself. I don't know if he can do it again in the next movie, but this film (which closely echoes the original novel but with modern updates), is as close to Ian Flemming's Bond as anyone (including Connery) has ever gotten.",positive
"This James Bond is hot! Loved the naked interrogation..haha. The pace of the film kept me continually interested, loved it!",positive
After the last few Bonds I felt like I was watching Mission Impossible or Borne Identity. James Bond movies usually have their own taste to separate from other spy movies. This movie does that and makes it feel like a GREAT movie. The new generation of Bond films are off to a good start.,positive
Excellent movie to introduce Daniel Craig into the Bond Franchise. Feels like the script for Casino Royale took the movies back to their 007 roots.,positive
"trumps goldeneye by retconing the originals. this is a good thing. its not weighted down by bonds age as a character or the cold war. its just driven by the character himself, which has not been portrayed better than he has in this film... not even by Connery.",positive
The ONLY good Bond movie. It'll be interesting to see if it was just a accident when the second comes out.,positive
My favourite Bond film,negative
"Finally, a Bond who isn't always smooth",positive
best bond movie. ever.,positive
"I'll just dispense with the ""Best Bond,"" stuff, because I have not seen nearly enough of the other Bond movies to make that judgement. However, I can compare it to other action movie, and Casino Royale is truly one of the best. The Bond wit is here with a twist, and the action is top notch. The casting of Craig and Green went a long way in the humanizing of these characters. So much more than a mindless action movie, Casino Royale has ideas behind it.",positive
Good Quality Bond. Craig well cast.,positive
Daniel Craig is a great new Bond.,positive
Definetly the best Bond since Goldeneye.,positive
"A nice change from its last few counterparts. Daniel Craig wins over the crowd with his Edgy and young portrayal of Bond. I loved Eva Green's character, she wasn't so transparent and fake as other bond girls. Definately a finer action movie, and I would rank this as one of the top, if not the top Bond movie.",positive
"Daniel Craig makes an AWESOME Bond, best one in a while.",positive
A decent bond film. But it's a little over the top with the violence.,negative
A Must See. Awesome movie. I think this is the best bond movie. Recommended.,positive
best bond movie ever FACT !,positive
"Var skeptisk innan jag masade mig till biografen, men jag får nog ge med mig; detta är den bästa bond-filmen so far. Filmen ger Bond en extra dimension och man får en liten förståelse för varför han blir den han är då berättelsen beskriver hur han fick sin 00-status. Får inte missas, oavsett vad man tycker om tidigare Bond-filmer.",positive
Now that's what i call James Bond.. by far the greatest 007 ever maid.,positive
"The best Bond, both the actor and the movie. I was very pleased with every decision that had been made to transform Bond into a proper movie. What is more, it is not just a good Bond, it's actually a good movie. A bit too long for me, but a nice story nevertheless. Now that Daniel Craig has taken over Bond, it makes me wonder why on earth Pierce Brosnan was ever even cast as 007. Hopefully the next one will be as good a movie as this one. I think it's important to notice that although Casino Royale owes a lot to the Jason Bourne movies, it stands on its own right just fine.",negative
It's an early call but I reckon a strong front runner for best James Bond film.,positive
"Best Bond flick since Sean Connery. I was worried at first, but after seeing it... it was absolutely amazing. Eva Green was also a great Bond girl.",positive
Definatley the best Bond since Connery. And the sea scene is HOT.,negative
See my review on myspace!,positive
The absolute best Bond,positive
over rated and too bloody long,negative
really really good. anyone else laugh a lot at the near naked woman riding the horse across the beach? no? just me then.,positive
"New James Bond, new style, I like it. The movie isn't that bad either.",negative
"Best Bond character to next Sean Connery. ""Sexy""",positive
Best Bond and if you can't handle that Fuck Off.,positive
Movie grew on me. Still like the old Bonds better.,positive
The only good thing is Daniel Craig!,negative
"I rooted for Daniel Craig from the start - he has long been a fave of mine, & he fills the role of Bond, & those blue trunks beautifully!",positive
I didn't get the hype.,negative
Best Bond since Sean Connerry,positive
"I'm not a Bond fan, but this film is a great spy film. Both gritty and slick.",negative
First Bond movie I have liked,positive
"An all new Bond, this is without doubt the best James Bond movie made so far. Maybe one of the most surprising revivals of a dying movie series.",positive
"best bond ever. who needs a car chase when you got that monkey man at the start, awesome",positive
the celebrity poker sketch and the blatant product placements killed whatever highlight there were for me,negative
"Yes, I am upset too. Why? Is it really that hard to make a good movie? I guess it can't always be a good thing.",negative
"Kickass, that's all I'm gonna say",positive
one of the best bond films ever. better than than all roger moores combined.,negative
Compared to the over the top plots of previous bond this was a fresh change. Craig may not have been my first choice but he proved his worth.,positive
Daniel Craig might just become the best Bond ever.,positive
"When i first heard Craig was gonna play lead, I thought it was a joke. He looked like a Russian alchie. I was worried. Sat down and watched the film with open mout. What an amazing transformation. Could be the best bond. The most believable secret agent. Tough enough. Buff enough, and very alpha. He is a-list now! A great story too. May be the best bond film of the lot!!!",positive
007 fan all the way. I loved this as much as Transformers.,positive
"The best bond since connery, highly entertaining sophisticated and still very bondesque, brilliant",positive
Bond rocks out. The one bond film I can stand to watch.,positive
Action doesnt out weigh the slowness,negative
"I like most of the Bond films but this one is amazing! Maybe it's because it's the telling of Bond becoming a double O agent and it's a lot less over the top, or it's the new actor (Daniel Craig)I'm not sure but it was a great and one of my Favs.",positive
"It's a lot of action, but a VERY good movie!",negative
Daniel Craig did an excellent job bringing out a sexier James Bond,positive
Not too similar to the original. Took the plot and just made it a shoot 'em up film.,negative
"budgie smugglers stole this show. absolute blast to watch, what a good return to the james bond franchise!",positive
Love the new Bond and can't wait to see the next film. The plot of this one was mediocre at best. How long could that damn poker game last? ... ugh,positive
The new Bond is fresh and exciting...a must see!,negative
Loved Daniel Craig as Bond! I thought the movie was very well done. It's too bad Eva Green had to die though.....,negative
"I'm - what many people may call - an ellitist Bond-fan: I prefer the books over the films, still think ""From Russia With Love"" and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" are the best Bondmovies and I enjoy my Bond to be down-to-earth. For years I thought Connery and Dalton were the only ones to bring Fleming's Bond on the silver screen. Casino Royale changed it all. After the dreadful Brosnan era (I do like ""GoldenEye"" and bits of ""The World Is Not Enough"" though) I - as an ellistist Bond fanatic - can rejoice: this movie is the best Fleming rendition I have ever laid my eyes upon. Daniel Craig, Martin Campbell and Paul Haggis have turned this sinking ship into a luxuary cruise. Craig puts down a magnificent presentation of the Her Majesty's best man on the field. Fleming would approve of the more raw suaveness, the aura of manliness and the genuine intelligent 'jokery'. This is Bond as I imagined him in the books: a normal bloke who does his job, although he hates the consequences and sacrefices of it. Not the womanizer we've seen in earlier portrails or the cheesy improv stand up comedian. Craig delivers. Period. Eva Green as Vesper Lynd is just perfect. In the book, Vesper is the woman who, for a big part, changes Bond as a human being: she's the first to captivate and break his heart. A role played to perfection. Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre brings us the first villain in years to be feared. A thumbs up aswell to how this movie follows the novel: the casino parts, the poker tournament (although it was baccarat in the book), the torture, the true romance between Bond and Vesper and Vesper's ultimate demise (again slightly different in the book). If you have not seen this film yet or you are no Bond-fan, try to open up for this character-driven masterpiece. It's nothing unlike previous Bondmovies (down-to-earth, darker, less humouress, less gadgets and even less action). A true diamond in British film history.",positive
"The movie seems great until you listen to the dialogue between Bond and the Eva Green character after he gets a (literal) bollocking. A man obviously wrote the crap wooden lines ""but I only want what's left of you"" . Tripe. But I'll take Mads Mikkelsen any time!",negative
just because my eva is involved<3,positive
"Finally, I've watched the first movie that is about the secret agent known as James Bond. Furthermore, ""You Know My Name"" is best opening song thus far in the franchise.",positive
"The best Bond movie to date, I was very skeptical, and it was just phenomenal. Daniel Craig is a real man's man in this movie. (In reference to A Guy's Guide to being a Man's Man, great book too.)",positive
Best Bond Ever and way better than that pussy Jason Bourne,positive
"The best Bond movie since Goldeneye, one of the best ever.",positive
on of the best Bond films out there,positive
FAV EVER!! He is thee best bond. Great movies and Daniel Craig is very easy on the eyes!!,positive
Ruined Bond movies... ok.. they needed to make a movie about poker... but not Bond!!!,negative
Everyone loved this but I didn't. Bond to me is pastiche & amusing. It was far too violent for a 12 (in UK). Yes it was well made but where were the jokes??????,negative
"I've seen most Bond films at some point, usually while too full to move away from them at Christmas, but this film is a class apart. Relatively sophisticated, classily acted, just enough cheese to let you know where you stand... definitely the best Bond to date. A breath of fresh air to the franchise.",positive
Was a bit dazzled with the choice of Craig. But his perfomance proved me wrong. One of the best bonds in quite a while,positive
Daniel Craig ... what more can I say! Best BOND ever!,positive
Stunning. The bond series on top form.,positive
Best Bond film for 20 years...,positive
"Den bästa bondfilmen någonsin. Och tro mig, jag har sett alla andra, säkert flera gånger om. Sedan gillar jag ju även att de kvinnliga karaktärerna äntligen har egen vilja och får vara så mycket mer!",positive
"The best James Bond flick I've seen, but I haven't seen all of them. Ha ha. Its so good though. The intensity is so high that despite its long running time, I never got bored at all once. The villians were great. I want to see that creepy dude with the eye in more movies! Daniel Craig did such a good job here I can't wait for the next one.",positive
"I liked Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, but I didn't love the Bond films he was in; I did love this movie",positive
"Daniel craig makes a great bond, and it's a great story, and it's time bond gets a little more tough guy, and a little less suave",positive
"the best Bond in years. He´s back with the depth, charisma and great lines that we know from the Connery era. And the women are no longer awkward, stupidified objects.",positive
Brosnan looked great as Bond but the movies were getting sillier and sillier. With Casino Royal Bond is redeemed (with a little help from a certain Jason Bourne).,positive
great action. improvement on the last Bond movies,positive
great! luved the car stunts,negative
"Daniel Craig has made the best bond in my eyes. Very suave yet bringing out the best and worst of Bond. My favourite so far, very classy and original.",positive
"A James Bond movie turned into a Christian Dior, Armani, Cartier commercial.",negative
"For some reason I didn't like it as much as the others. Too dark, not as much of the light, witty humor of the Bond I love. Still good, but not great.",negative
Liked Mr. Craig as Bond...blond bond...hmmm...,negative
Pretty awesome James Bond debut by Daniel Craig. They have redeemed themselves from Pierce Bronson. Judi Dench did a fantastic job replying her role as M.,negative
My fave BOND...so sexy,positive
May be the only Bond film I'll ever really like.,positive
Excellent movie if it werent for the explicit scenes.,negative
Best Bond Ever! Can't wait for the next 1,positive
"Didn't like the story. Daniel Craig is great, but not as Bond.",negative
"I'm not a big Bond fan, but this one really hit the spot. Daniel Craig feels right for the part.",negative
"The action is good, Craig is good, better than Brosnan, but I still wonder where they can go after this.",negative
"Sean is shtill the best, but this one is worth it for the torture scene and the destruction of a nice Aston, oh, and the resurrection, and .... Well, you get it.",positive
i absolutly luved it. and daniel craig - so so hot!,positive
Pretty damn good for the first bond movie with Craig. Not enough plot though - no real enemy.,positive
one of my favorite. doesn't beat sean connery but you tried daniel.,positive
Craig as Bond just doesn't do it for me. He simply isn't handsome or charming enough.,negative
my first James Bond movie... what a great one to start with...,positive
Que bueno que esta Bond!!!,positive
"hes gritier, faluable and can act, yes bond is back and returns spectacularly in casino royale the first book written by ian fleming. This film has has not only revived a dieing francise but set the bar for other action films. Most of the film brilliance for me is down to new bond Daniel Craig and script doctor Paul Haggis. i just hope they keep the new hard gritty bond for the next film and dont revert to a classic but ultimately outdated formula",positive
"Such a great Bond Movie, great acting, great fight scenes, a reall gritty revamp of Bond",positive
The next best Bond movie.,positive
best bond film ever made?,positive
surley he's better than pierce brosnan,positive
"A lot of people a fuss about a blonde Bond, particularly a blonde in Speedos. Despite this, being a major poker lover and player, this is about the only bond movie I can say I enjoyed",positive
Amazing. I stinking loved it.,positive
I like the new Bond character.,negative
It's different from other 007 movies but I enjoyed it,positive
"Absolutely stunning chase sequence with parkour practitioner Sebastien Foucan and Danny Craig whets the appetite... which goes largely unfulfilled. Teeth clenching torture seen ends in baffling deus ex machina, with pointless denouement tacked on the end.",negative
best bond since golden eye,positive
Daniel & Eva makes such a great match on the scren! and the story is so sad! wich I love!,positive
Fantastic film .... well made and Mr. Craig makes probably the best Bond since Dalton,positive
"Cliche free and Bond is presented as an impetuous, cold blooded hitman. The way he was always intended. Great film",negative
"one of the best modern bond films, and surely better then the last pierce brosnan ones.",positive
"This has to be the best Bond film, Daniel Craig is hot in this",positive
"Pas si mal! Une fin étrangement molle, mais un nouveau style finalement très efficace!",negative
It was ok I guess. But I'm not a James Bond fan at all...,negative
Great way to relaunch Bond series.,positive
"Ok. I'll admit it: when I heard Danny Craig was the next bond I was shocked. HIM?? I wanted Clive Owen dammit! Well I must say Craig has done an INCREDIBLE job turning a quintessentially 2-dimensional character into a flawed, ruthless, brutal, complex individual. It's the first time in the Bond franchise that I have finally witnessed Fleming's character come to life on the silver screen. Yes, this is what Bond should really be like... sorry Sir Roger!",positive
Daniel Craig the best Bond? Not to me. This doesn't have the best gadgets or car chases. But it is the best Bond film thus far. THe missing half star? Give us everything this film delivered + the souped up cars and gadgets. Can't wait for the next one now (Whereas after Die Another Day I was dreading this one).,positive
Connery then Brosnan then probably Moore then maybe Craig. Exclude him as a Bond and it's a pretty solid action flick.,negative
liked the movie but didn't make much sense as a prequel...still say Sean Connorry is the ultimate Bond!,negative
"Some cool scenes, kinda boring though.",negative
"loved it, true agent!",positive
An admirable return to the true spirit of the Bond films.,positive
"I usually like James Bond, but this was okay. Blond Bond?",negative
"As far as films go, this is the best Bond movie yet. This is the most unlike the other bond movies, however. Daniel Craig's performance is good, and this movie actually contains some worthy emotion and sadness at the end. Not a real Bond movie, though. (Which is a good thing).",negative
The best Bond ever...,positive
Daniel Craig is far beyond my expectation~~ 007 can be a yellow hair guy~,positive
"Good movie, Daniel Craig did a good job playing James Bond.",negative
One of my favorite James Bond movies,positive
Solid movie...Bond is stone cold badass,positive
"The best Bond film to date...if not ever. It had everything an audience should look for: an intelligent plot, a protagonist who doesn't take crap from anyone and is strong enough to take a swing in the pills and laugh about it, and a villain who dies appropriately. Daniel Craig portrays a bond who could survive in the heart of the wild with a toothpick and a set of flints. I hope this guy keeps up the glory he created with this film!",positive
"Dude does look like Joe Montana, pretty good flick",positive
a pretty good Bond movie!!,negative
Bond is alive and well.,positive
1 of THE BEST bond films ever!!,positive
"revitalized the series, take that Brosnan. Who even said that Craig was a better bond.",positive
"Who else, but James Bond, could make a building in Venice slide into the canal, and do it looking good?",positive
I was never a bond guy before. I look forward to the next one.,positive
fliipin fantastic movie daniel craig is so hot but man it was tramatizing watching vespa die in that lift i was scared! slefish cow she desirved to die now hes all mine!,positive
not the best pick to play bond,negative
"A gritty, determined thriller with a host of Bond Girls and Daniel Craig proving all the doubters wrong. Superb and a welcome reinvention.",positive
Probably one of my favourite thrillers,positive
An Awesome Bond film with the new Aston Martin DBS beautiful! I wish the ending could have be better.,positive
"This movie is so good. Despite the fact that its like 3hrs long, I find myself wanting to watch it all the time. Love so much about this movie, i'm excited for the next film.",positive
Gotta be the best Bond film in my opinion. Daniel Craig did an excellent job as the 007.,positive
Best Bond film since Golden Eye.,positive
really good. you can tell that it takes a cue from the Bourne movies. the action is still stylized but it's grittier than any other Bond film. Daniel Craig was rocking the shit in this!,positive
The best Bond film ever!,positive
"I watched this again recently and enjoyed it just as much as I did the first time (and I'm no fan of Bond films at all). To it's credit, it breaks the formula of previous Bond movies which is great as they were just getting insane (the horror that was the invisible car anyone?). I'm deducting one star for the twenty minutes of slush at the end but apart from that, action is great, story is great and the cast are excellent.",positive
Pierce shall remain my fav Bond,negative
It was much better then I thought it would be. Still no Sean Connery though,positive
My favorite Bond film.,positive
"Daniel Craig as James Bond? At first I thought it cannot work... until I actually saw the movie. He is the most natural, the most intelligent, the macho and lover-type of Bond since S. Connery!!! Great creation!!!! I love him... A.xxx",positive
One of the best Bond movies ever!!!,positive
Tis much much better than I thought it was going to be!!!,positive
An amazing film regardless of the Bond name. Daniel Craig is the man.,positive
"An excellent addition to the 007 series! Daniel Craig does a great job portraying a young, trigger happy Bond.",positive
it was an amazing movie,positive
One of the best ever Bond movies.,positive
super awesome movie. kicks pierce brosnan in the balls and then tea bags him.,positive
"A damn fine film. (SPOILER WARNING) The only thing that spoiled the experience was knowing that Vesper was going to betray Bond and die, having read the original novel before seeing the film. My new favorite bond film, replacing Goldeneye, and I can't wait for the next one.",positive
"Me luff Daniel Craig's work, but he's no Bond!",negative
A blonde Bond? Ian Fleming is turning over in his grave.,negative
is it the best Bond film? Possibly. Is it the best portrayal of Bond? Defo,positive
Can't wait for the next one.,positive
good not as good as the sean connery ones,positive
My Favorite Bond Movie,positive
The torture scene was too much.,negative
Unreasonably dissapointing,negative
Daniel Craig is a BAMF,positive
"my idol, the mad whore lolz",positive
One of the best Bond movies yet.,positive
"Daniel Craig may prove to be the best Bond yet, fantasticly subdued.",positive
Brilliant. Roll on Bond 22!,positive
A fantastic and refreshing James Bond flick.,positive
Once of the best bond films ever and most definitely the most beautiful bond girl ever.,positive
"Daniel Craig...mmmm, mmmm",positive
Best Bond in a while!!,positive
"daniel craig is frickin badass in the bond role, incredible action, hot bond girl, amazing action. way better than any of the bonds involving brosnan. the intro sequence is amazing. the song ""you know my name"" by chris cornell is amazing and works so well. i love this movie.",positive
"What a return to form for James Bond! As a Bond fanatic from childhood, I didn't expect too much seeing as how average Pierce Prosnan was as Bond. Daniel Craig is exactly what Bond should be: Ruthless and brooding. There are some excellent action sequences and also you get to see his softer side. Welcome back Mr. Bond!",positive
Daniel Craig as Bond? Amazing.,positive
"BEST BOND MOVIE EVER! i'm frm the generation tht grrew up with Brosnan, not Connery as Bond and the idea of replacing him was unthinkable but Daniel Craig has made this character his own...and the no-gadgets Bond really brings a sense of refreshment to the franchise.",positive
Proud to be British.,positive
"The only bond film I've ever watched all of, some of the stunt work was quite impressive but wasnt enough to make me say I enjoyed it. A good film but not for me.",negative
good film one to be seen in hd quality,positive
not the best bond movie,positive
"OK we all like the stupidity of Roger Moores eye brows, but this film is a serious piece of work. The future of the franchise is surley assured if they continue in this vein.",positive
"mile high above all brosnan & moore bonds. daniel craig is a good bond. but i didn't like the story at all. too much poker play, not enough action, and way too less gadgets. jack bauer and jason bourne would kick bond's ass any day of the week.",positive
could have been worse. not much worse.,negative
"Daniel Craig shockingly did a great job as James Bond. Screw everyone who is saying Bond can't be blond...granted he's no Connery or Brosnan, but he's a decent 007. This movie was better than expected and was jammed packed with action. The film does show a darker side of the secret agent, which is much more interesting than some of the portrails of 007 in the 1980's. Not the best Bond movie ever, but definitely one of the better ones...leaving me excited for the next 007 adventure. Plus Eva Green is pretty damn hot in this.",positive
yeah Daniel Craig did pretty good job huh,positive
"they try to break the bond formula a bit here which is somewhat unfortunate only in so far as they don't succeed very well. *some* of the things they do are interesting, but the multitude of twists at the end just make you ask yourself ""why wasn't this movie over 30 minutes ago?""",negative
..mmmmmm....bathing suit scene with Danial Craig...mmmmm...,negative
"This new version of ""Casino Royale"" is the only Bond movie that aint suckage ;)",positive
"If Goldfinger defined Bond, this is the re-defined Bond that none of the others had done. No more BS invisible cars, this time it's real stunts - the opening parkour chase alone is the most impressive chase scene I have EVER seen, keeping two stunt men onscreen in most shots. I'll stop before I drone on... Half star off for the lovey-dovey 10 minutes.",positive
action...would watch it again,positive
only bond film i've ever enjoyed. craig is the perfect bond. who cares if he's blonde and built? he fits.,negative
in my opinion the best bond ever!,positive
"Now...Daniel Craig IS the new Bond, way better than Brosnan!!!",positive
"not bond, never will be",negative
Suprisingly close to the Fleming novel given that that was published about 10 years before Dr No (the movie). Best bond debut since Brosnan and arguably better Bond than Connery!,positive
"Although I still have my doubts about Craig, I think he did an amazing job and it is possibly the best Bond film of the lot. Leagues above Brosnan's sorry final attempts.",positive
A swift pat on the back for Goldeneye but step aside Pierce.,positive
"Had faith in Craig from the beginning and he did not disappoint. And finally, a Bond girl who did not irritate!",positive
"One of the best James Bond films, quite easily. Well shot (a rare thing as they are mostly bland at best) with some excellent performances from Daniel Craig, Mads Mikkelsen, Jeffrey Wright and Giancarlo Giannini. Craig takes 007 back to his roots, both in terms of plot and character. Ian Fleming's original novel from '53 is given a surprisingly good adaptation where we are finally seeing the darker, harder edge to the original character which has been sadly lacking from most of the films. We see James Bond's first two execution jobs with the service which earn him the OO rank and follow him through this rather dark story as he learns some harsh realities of his job and who he is going after. Let down only by the odd cheesy action moment and obvious product placement.",negative
Daniel Craig is the Best Bond Ever!!!,positive
"This could very well be the best Bond ever. Yes it's THAT good. Daniel Craig is excellent, the plot is dark... Bond is serious now, FINALLY. I hope they continue the bond films in this way, I really do.",positive
"The best Bond film to date, Craig is excellent although colder than the other Bonds however this is the first so that may have been planned. I love this Bond because of it's lack of tacky gadgets, it's gritty realism, the clean fight scenes and of course the humour factor. Many twists and turns... a brilliant Bond movie if I ever saw one. I now own on DVD too :)",positive
The best Bond film of them all.,positive
This was the best James Bond Movie Yet.,positive
The best bond movie made since I was born. Hopefully they can do it again.,positive
Two hours of Daniel Craig walking around half naked proving that he's in much better shape than I am.,negative
I thought it was one of the best bond movies i've seen. Excellent opening action scene.,positive
best bond since golden eye...,positive
"My favorite Bond movie to date. They got everything right, and Craig is the best Bond yet!",positive
Daniel Craig is the best James Bond (sorry Sean),positive
Nah...didn't care for this 1.,negative
Quite possibly the best modern Bond. The new title song was amazing as well.,positive
"Best Bond movie, but still not sold on Craig",positive
Not a real bond man.,negative
This is the best Bond movie ever made!,positive
"Good action movie, I enjoyed this one, and the storyline kept it interesting",positive
Awesome and tons of action!,positive
really really good Bond -,positive
the best i really enjoyed it.,positive
"holy testicles. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME. opening credits, blew my mind.",negative
Bond the way he was meant to be. A hard man with a bit of charm.,positive
The absolute best Bond flick ever made..Sean was probably still the best bond tho...(Just in the wrong movies!),positive
Definitely the best Bond movie.,positive
Better than pretty much all Pierce Brosnan Bond movies.,positive
the best james bond yet,positive
"seen the first 10 mins, brilliant",positive
"the opening sequence was SO COOL, and then it was pretty good",negative
good film. lots of crazy fight scenes,negative
Bond beating a guy to death in the john - what could be better?,positive
"best bond... almost a mix of bond and bourne, and also closer to Fleming's bond... plot was believable and thrilling",positive
By far the worst bond movie. I would rather watch a corpse decompose then be forced to watch this mockery of the bond empire,negative
Bond turned Jack Bauer. Best in years,positive
"the best thing that could happen to Bond, but they should just let the poor hero retire.",negative
The best bond yet. Daniel Craig is awesome as the next Bond.,positive
"Best Bond ever, this from a loyal old-bond fan, only missing gadgets & campiness",positive
A lot of people have misgivings about Daniel Craig as 007. But I thought this was the best Bond film since Goldfinger.,positive
"I love the action, the sceens and the people, but he jus doesn't feel like Bond to me",positive
"I hate all Bond movies, and this one is no exception. The opening chase scene was cool, but it was all downhill from there.",negative
"Best Bond, I love these films and Craig is totally cool in the role, roll on Bond 22.",positive
disgraces the name 'James Bond' with advertisments. he is made into a sellout loser in this one,negative
"Ratage intégral.Destruction compléte du mythe de James Bond qui ressemble à un Poutine ultraviolent et sans psychologie aucune. Il refuse même le martini habituel ! De plus avec un titre comme ca on aurait aimé un vrai suspens avec le poker mais non, rien. Adieu James Bond.",negative
"Casino Royale has gone where no Bond film has gone before. Normally limited to being smooth, suave, imperturbable and unrealistically invincible, Daniel Craig's Bond is gritty, realistic, modern, violent and expendable. Casino Royal is jam packed with terrific action sequences which leave you on the end of your seat, and the violence is sometimes eye watering. I enjoyed this Bond because he is normal and I could relate to him - he drove a Ford Mondeo and used a Sony Ericsson K750i instead of the usual bespoke gadgets made by MI6. Plus he is beatable, and nearly dies during the film, which is not the norm for the traditional Bond. All in all - phenomenal film.",positive
"Now I love the books, and this is one of the best adaptations I've seen. Obviouslty they couldn't do how it is the book. The previous movies had set the bar too high and plus the book is cold war. Craig is amazing, if Forest Whittaker had not been there then he'd had definitaley have walked away with that BAFTA.",positive
"Very good. The blonde Bond has it, even with a slightly dull plot. Great action.",positive
"it gets a high score bc it was worth the wait, even though craig stinks",positive
Daniel Craig is the best Bond and this is the best Bond movie. Neither is a complement.,negative
"I've seen all the Bond movies and this may be the best yet. I never thought I could stand a blond Bond, I was glad to be proven wrong.",positive
"It's Bond, but it's a proper film at last after all the crap. Good tension in the card game.",positive
Brilliant! Realistic gritty action that didnt stop.,positive
Daniel Craig is soooo Yummy!!!,positive
"I hate 007 movies, but this was great. They actually made Bond a real character.",negative
Really liked seeing the story behind Bond. Also this is the only Bond movie I've ever seen all the way through.,negative
"Not my favorite of the Bond movies, but it was good.",negative
5*'s only because of Eva Green. Without her it would be 4*'s,positive
"The best Bond movie in a very, very long time.",positive
"daniel craig is a really good bond, he cant top sean, no-one can! but he is a very good bond and the film is complete action as a bond film should be!",positive
One of my favorite movies of all time!,positive
"5 stars from me. This is what Bond should always have been. Gritty, realistic, and devoid of over-the-top gadgets. Craig is brilliant as Bond.",positive
one of the most entertainign movies i have seen in a long while.,positive
the best bond film ! nuff said.,positive
The best Bond movie for 2 decades!,positive
"This movie started out as a pile of dogshit - lots of senseless violence but thankfully the movie takes a turn for the better and is very good in the end. Daniel Craig is still not my favorite Bond, but he does a good job overall.",positive
This movie is one of the best if not the best Bond Film. The action is incredible and Daniel Craig is a fantastic Bond with charm and malice. A must see for any moviegoer! 5 stars!!!!,positive
"Best Bond Ever to me, sorry sean! JUst another great screenplay by Paul Haggis.",positive
"Daniel Craig = HOTTNESS and I think he's a really good Bond, This kept my attention really well and I usually don't like ""guy"" movies",positive
Great great movie. Was awesome to see Bond in a slightly different light.,positive
Fucking product placement ruined an awesome movie once again. Fuck the car in this movie. Also I would like to note that the ball breaking scene made me cry.,negative
this is how bond movies are supposed to be made,positive
The New Bond did a great job.,negative
"Dreadful, left before the end",negative
"This ain't bond, this is crap",negative
"are you having a laugh cooper, pierce is shit as bond, its all about connery!",positive
brilliant outing for Craig.,positive
HAS A FEW QUESTIONABLE PARTS BUT GOOD.,negative
"Craig is so handsome. I love him. Great performance, the best Bond.",positive
Bond is Back!!! Craig is excellent as 007.,positive
I love daniel craig lol!!,negative
"I missed the first 15 or 20 minutes, but as my first experience with a bond movie, I enjoyed it!",negative
"It would have been an okay bond movie if the hour of ""Oh I love you and let's run away and love each other"" wasn't in it.",negative
"Great action scenes, great imagery, and great title... it was originally supposed to be called ""Everything or Nothing""",positive
If it wasn't for the actual casino scene it would be perfect.,positive
"The best Bond in decades, keeps close to the book as well",positive
The way Bond always should have been.,positive
"Didn't have any gadgets, but other than that a perfect bond movie.",positive
"Probably the best Bond film of all time. Sean Connory is still the best Bond in terms of suaveness, but this by far the best and most entertainging Bond out there. Who knew - Bond can get hurt. Shame about the title song though",positive
Never was very fond of Pierce's bond. This is a fresh new direction- and I can't wait for more.,positive
Best Bond ever... Now where's that chair ?,positive
"I really did not like Daniel Craig as bond, he seemed rather ""un-smooth"" I was not everly impressed, I felt like it could have taken a better twist seemed too predictable etc....",negative
"beste bondfilmen helt klart, men så er det jo en bondfilm..",positive
Good movie. Nice action. I like Daniel Craig as the next James Bond.,negative
Possibly the best Bond film.,positive
Top three bond film!!,positive
"Sorry, I really felt annoying during that one !",negative
"Some scenes just went WAY too long. But Daniel Craig just might be my second-favorite Bond. After Connery, before Brosnan.",negative
"The problem with the James Bond franchise was, the whole tongue in cheek thing got really old. James Bond got goofy. Daniel Craig completely blew the world and its complaining away when he played the best James Bond yet in this film. And yes I think he was better than Connery due to the content of the movies. If Connery was in this movie instead of the other Bond films he would have been amazing, because it fits his profile better: badass. Connery had no business doing the earlier Bond movies, he's just not...well...gay enough. He's the kind of mother fucker who will slam your head through a window, and he just didn't show that in his Bond movies. What really makes this one great is the direction the franchise has taken. MGM realized that 007 was getting too unrealistic and too corny and too gay. Therefore now we have a character who just beats the fuck out of people. Bond has gone from movie to film. The acting is top notch, the action is wonderful, not bad photography, and the jokes aren't fucking annoying as fuck. The Bond series just got a whole lot better.",positive
A lot of action. Not that good of a film though. You have to be a James Bond fan to like it.,negative
A much darker Bond....I thoroughly enjoyed this one.,positive
"By far the best Bond for a loooooooong time! Unlike his predecessors, this Bond is actually somebody to fear. He is smart, resourcefull, and exceptionally dangerous. Now I can't watch older Bonds without laughing about caricature that those characters are compared to Daniel Craig.",positive
"I love Daniel Craig as Bond, awesome!!",positive
The spoof was better,negative
best bond since roger moore,negative
Best of all Bonds despite the cast.,positive
Please can you really get worse than with this bond movie- I personally did not like it,negative
Fresh re-start of the Bond franchise à la Batman Begins was for the Batman series. Fans of the traditional Bond feel might be disappointed however.,negative
the best bond film for a long time. daniel craig suited the part really well,positive
rough and gritty with not enough casino action in,negative
Wow loved this. I'm not the hugest Bond fan but i really enjoyed this,positive
"First I was very skeptical about the choice of taking Craig Daniel as the new James Bond... He seemed too blunt to act the typical refinement of Bond, but the film is excellent in many ways. Awful villains, a cruel plot and a freshly promoted brute that discovers the life of the soon-to-be most famous secret agent of the world and the most feared of MI-6's ennemies! The film is also an excellent nowadays adaptation of the Casino Royale book!",positive
I am afraid to say that Craig is probably the best Bond so far.. It breaks my heart as I really liked Connery!,negative
Best of the recent Bonds.,positive
The only Bond film I enjoyed.,positive
excellent bond and great tense action. only bettered by from russia with love. now how about a remake of that one !!,positive
"Daniel Craig is easily the ugliest James Bond, but probably the second best ever. (Behind Connery, of course.) Highly fake, shaky script, but great fun.",positive
"Easy on the eye for both the boys and the girls? Check A classic Bond car with all the gadgets? Check, but no Q. Suave in the face of adversity that is the bond signature? Check",positive
Tied with GoldenEye as my favorite Bond film. Exactly what the Bond franchise needed to resuscitate its image.,positive
Apparently..Daniel Craig is not fit to be the new 007,negative
one of the best bond movies since sean connery was bond,positive
"excellent action scenes, had me on the edge, though I cannot say that its 'action-packed' but it is a good action-adventure movie, except for the cliff-hanger.",positive
"cool story , its alreayd 2006?",positive
"Bond's rebooting gives him a more human, brutal portrayal that puts the other films to shame. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery!",positive
"""You just scratched my balls!""",positive
"An amazing re-boot. Daniel Craig kicks major ass and this Bond quickly shakes the campyness the last few Bonds had. Awesome action, a great story and a bad-ass new Bond that will continue to impress in the films to come.",positive
"It was a bit dissapointing but Daniel Craig is probably the best James Bond yet, besides Sean Connery. He walked and talked just how James Bond should, so he did it perfectly. Alot more violent than the other films, I think they went for a realistic feel for this one. It was pretty long though and it got slightly boring at the end. Still a great film and it's one of the best James Bond movies in a long time.",negative
Absolutely the best one of the James Bond series! Wore out the DVD!,positive
Daniel Craig gives Bond a much more darker feel for his character which i was impressed with. The suspense is there from the get go with the chase right at the start and yes things do get destroyed including that old house in Venice. Eva Green is somewhat attractive and is a great add to the list of Bond girls. One of the better bond movies I've seen considering I really wasn't into Pierce Brosnan. Good Movie,positive
daniel craig...2nd best Bond next to Roger Moore,positive
three words. daniel craig... speedo,negative
This is the way Bond films should be.,positive
"Excellent in all respects except for Vesper's awful accent which sounds really forced, OTT, and like an American trying to sound like an archetypal English toff. Good to see a darker more complicated Bond again.",negative
Reinvigorated the bond experience action at every turn and a few plot twists makes this a film worthy of her majesty's secret service.,positive
Better than the hotbuttered popcorn,negative
"yes, yes, yes, new bond kicks ass!. bring the noise! bond forever. I love how they are reviving the series that had seemed to go off of the deep end.",positive
personally i thought daniel craig was a damn good bond.,positive
"Top film, got this on Blu Ray and the detail is superb. A must see bond film.",positive
"Now I like all bond flicks but this has to be the best, yet, action a tad OTT but that's James for you.",positive
"James Bond is back, and back with a slightly more modern bang. Casino Royale takes a step away from the previous films in the bond franchise, with Daniel Craig stepping into shoes of 007, and for me personally this was needed, the studio has done a great job casting Craig. What Craig offers is evident after about 10mins of the film, the scene in Madagascar, involving bond chasing a very quick and nimble bomb maker across a construction site couldn't have been done by any other bond, maybe Connery in his early days, but Brosnan the previous bond, just wouldn't of looked right (15 year age difference between Brosnan and Craig). The move to a younger and more physical bond is much better suited for todays spy agent stories. Craig is joined by M (Judy Dench) & Vespa (Eva Green) which both give strong supporting roles, the dialogue between M & 007 is a real/love hate relationship and is written perfectly. The story starts from scratch in the bond universe, so all previous films have no mention in this, its bond starting his career in modern times, although you find out where his famous one liners come from, and a funny scene is when bond asks for a ""Vodka Martini"" and the waiter replies ""Shaken or stirred"", and bond snaps back ""Do I look like I give a damn?"". Other things which keep this a bond story are the ever present villains, and this time high roller poker player Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) takes the position. He typical bond villain, evil looking, scare on the face, attractive women on the side and a henchman at his side, which for once doesn't get involved in anything Story line wise, this film is rather weak, Le Chiffre has bet some terrorist's money that the stock market will go up or down, he loses that bet and must win back the money in a international high stakes poker match which bond is entered into. Not very secret agent, and to be fair not very good. The poker games are complete jokes, anyone ever playing a hand of poker will be laughing to themselves at the hands the player get. To keep it 007, the producers have not messed with some of the winning formula's, great locations, great cars and great looking women. Overall the film is a good watch, and the style is nice step away from the previous films, although in this case the film could of done with slightly more substance with the storyline. If you watched Bond before you might be slightly surprised to see it step away from the old films, but if you new to bond, this is a perfect introduction.",positive
"he he - my name is Bond, James Bond=))) Classy, bondy, funny=)) lack of bond gadjets is upsetting, and the absence of bond theme in the credits too. Although, i liked the title sequence. Oh - and next time the bond have to have a bond face, rather than a face of a russian spy=)))))",positive
"Un excellent travail par Martin campbell, j'invite d'ailleurs ceux qui ont aimé casino royale a revoir Goldeneye pour voir a quel point dans ce film aussi chaque plan était soigné",positive
"Daniel Craig sure beats Peirce Brosman! The new James is more rugged and cocky, he fits the role very well. Plus the poker scenes were wicked!",negative
"I thought no-one could beat Sean Connery, I was wrong! Best Bond ever!",positive
Daniel Craig is a huge badass and turned Bond into a hard-boiled assassin. Probably the finest Bond movie ever with the Best Bond as well. Sorry Sean Connery. This movie is also intriguing because this movie is essentially Bond's origins or the origins of how he becomes the James Bond we all know. And it's that journey that makes this Bond movie the most intriguing and entertaining.,positive
"By far the best Bond movie I have ever seen! I love sean Connery, but this film had it all! Great acting, great story and lots of action!",positive
It's good to see a portrayal of James Bond with emotions. This one is my personal favorite.,positive
"Was reluctant to see another new Bond, yet found it incredible. The opening scene was amazing. Craig actually pulls it off as Bond.",positive
Hands down my favorite Bond film. The main bond girl even had personality... and a brain!,positive
"La mejor pelicula de BOnd en años. Excelente accion, aunque el final no tanto. Este tipo sin tanta pinta callo a los criticos con su actuacion mas humana y menos idealizada del 007. De las mejores peliculas de accion del 2006.",positive
"With the quips and explosions formula gone flat yonks ago, it was hard to see where this franchise could go. But this film manages to take the bore out of Bond, by making him human, fallable and believable. The plot is somewhat tortuous, but the pace doesn't drop and there are some excellent set pieces. As a whole, it reinvigorates the original JB!",positive
Honestly.. I think it is the bond movie so far.,positive
"As a James Bond fan, I was excited to see the new Bond film in '06. Much like the Batman series, the Bond series in the 90's and 2000's were getting progressively worse. I have never been a big Pierce Brosnan as James Bond fan, so I was happy to see that Daniel Craig did an outstanding job in re-booting the 007 franchise. I am certainly looking forward to the sequal. The acting is well done, as are the special effects. Cheers!",positive
Good & expensive. But Bond is no Bourne!!!,negative
one of my favourite bond films i was actually completely sucked in! although craig is not the best bond in my opinion,positive
"A blonde james bond, i thought what the fuck when i heard Daniel Craig was going to be the next Sean Connery but my word he was pure class",positive
"Craig is very good, which was supprising if im honest!",positive
"As an owner of every Bond film on DVD as well as a huge fan of the franchise, Casino Royale had big shoes to fill in my opinion. After seeing it, I was convinced, Daniel Craig IS the new Bond. Craig gives one of the grittiest performances I've seen from any actor playing the 00 agent. Casino Royale takes a much more realistic, what if, approach to it's storytelling that is a refreshing change from the outlandish special effects-draped missions of Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan. Casino Royale is the best action film of 2006.",positive
it has been the best of the modern bonds the previous ones where pretty crap,positive
"Finally they got Bond back on track. Add a dash of Connery's cheeky arrogance, a dash of Moore's style , take out the stupid sci-fi gadgets and get back to story telling.",positive
Craig makes someone who isnt a fan of the 'spy' genere become a serious fan. Cant wait for Bond 22!!,negative
best bond for ages - an about time,negative
"The best Bond movie yet. I love the new guy, much better than Pierce Brosnan.",positive
best bond ever... except for sean connery,positive
almost as good as goldeneye. nowhere near a classic like goldfinger.,positive
dbr highlight and so is poker,positive
my favourite bond movie!! finally after all these years a james bond movie worth seeing...,positive
Best Bond yet. True to the book and well done by Daniel Craig.,positive
enjoyed this more than what i thought i would & is one of better bond films that have been done in a while - hope he can live up 2 this one in the next one,positive
"I think he is a pretty good Bond, wasnt too sure about the whole falling in love thing",negative
"Best Bond Ever. Makes Bond less campy and cliched and into an Action Hero. I like the line right up in the beginning where his target tells him the second time is always [easier] but Bond shoots him before he can finish and does it for him with one word ""considerably"" If this does not make sense just watch the part right before the title song....",positive
best james bond for many many years. very clever and extremely dark,positive
"This film is pure sex. The cars, the settings, the costumes, the weapons, the technology, the cinematography, the man.",positive
"i give this movie 500,000,000 stars!!!! in fact this is the best movie of all time!!!!!!!!",positive
"Director Martin Campbell takes a middle-road approach with this film, therefore it only features a few action sequences. In terms of length, I believe the film is a little too long, as some parts drag, but also a little too short, as more could be explained at certain points in the film. Bond girl Eva Green does an ok job, but she hasn't got the looks to make her either very memorable or impressive.",negative
"Extremly good film. Plot, acting and effects top nocth.",positive
John wasn't too sure about him at 1st but I loved it,positive
"This is the James Bond movie that fans were waiting for. You get to see the time that James Bond actually became the ever-so-popular 007.<p>The story is typical James Bond with some nice twists and turns. I just felt that the film took a little too long to get to the meat of the story. The addition of using poker as an important part of the story was really interesting, but they dwelled on it just a little too long. By the end of the game I didn't care who won. I just wanted James Bond to shoot the place up. One thing this film did do well was show the immaturity of the Bond character. He makes mistakes that you don't see him make in previous films.</p><p>The acting is good. This is only the first Bond movie from Craig, but I think he will be able to carry the Bond character for a few more films without fail. Mads Mikkelsen was pretty good, but his character just didn't cut it as a big villain. Another thing this film really lacked was memorable characters. Aside from Daniel Craig, Eva Green, and Mads Mikkelsen, every other character is totally forgettable.</p><p>The action is done pretty well. I enjoyed the airport sequence very much and the chase in the beginning was pretty good as well, although it was a little long. It reminded me of the movie <i>B13</i>. The only thing this film was lacking was a good car chase.</p><p>I wouldn't say that this is a new start for James Bond, but it is a good start for Daniel Craig's run at it. Most James Bond fans should find this entertaining.",negative
"Everyone had their doubts about Craig being the new Bond. Eventually he proved those doubts unstable. Not the classy Bond we've all been used to, Craig shows the ""macho"" side of 007! Thumbs Up!!!",positive
"Back to basics without any of the stupidity of the last Brosnan movie. An invisible car, is a gadget too far!",positive
Solid flick. Owes alot to The Bourne series.,positive
Probably better then previous films but still a bit of a let down. The portrayal of Bond doesn't paint him in a very positive light and it gets long winded in the middle.,negative
"Simply Brilliant!!!! Daniel Craig was outstanding, very much alside Roger Moore. Best James Bond i think in along time. Daniels eyes were very intense at times and that torture scene, well what a man!!",positive
"I Love All Bond Films. However, I'm Particularly Happy With This One Because It Goes Back To The Roots Of The Franchise. Plus Daniel Craig Makes A Good Bond.",positive
Has to be the best of bond film from the last couple of decades. A bit long but there was plenty I loved about it.,negative
One of the better bond flicks. It's been a while...,negative
This puts the missing pieces in to develop the Bond character in a way you better understand him and like him more in later (timewise not production wise) episodes,positive
El mejor James Bond de la historia,positive
"Some really nice stunts. Not quite the Bond movi I'm used to and I missed Q's gadgets, but I guess they didn't fit into the story. Overall a good movie.",negative
A great step forward for the Bond franchise,positive
"I could be sneaky and let you get halfway through the review before revealing this, but let's get it out of the way first thing instead: I've never seen another James Bond movie all the way through paying attention. I was dragged to <i>Tomorrow Never Dies</i> ten years ago, but had no investment in it and just vaguely recall a large ""stealth boat"" and a shootout on it. Or something. The same people drug me into numerous <i>Goldeneye</i> gameplay sessions, and I once tried to watch <i>Never Say Never Again</i> and got very bored and stopped. So, if this shocks and outrages you...most likely you should stop reading this now. If this surprises you, well, read on for a different viewpoint as I imagine your experience must be different. And for those of you who have not seen even this one--read on for an opinion from a similar position. James Bond (Daniel Craig, though I think almost no one doesn't know that's the case for this film) is an agent for MI6, the British Intelligence agency also known as SIS (Secret Intelligence Service) who shows up in the office of corrupt section chief Dryden, who sneers, knowing Bond cannot have the ""double-0"" status required for assassination until he has two kills. A quick flashback for the viewer and a sudden realization (though subtly played by Malcolm Sinclair) by Dryden establishes the death of his assistant Fisher (Daud Shah) as the first and the obvious one upcoming as the second. Thus, Bond's 00 status (and so codename 007) are established, and he then takes a mission pursuing a bomb-maker named Mollaka (Sébastein Foucan) in Madagascar. When the agent assisting Bond makes their presence too obvious, Mollaka bolts and Bond chases him down (mostly using the sport/activity/thing called parkour, a sort of stepchild of which is free running, which Foucan founded) to an embassy, where a lose-lose situation leads him to shooting far more people than is necessary. He does gain Mollaka's cellphone and finds an SMS from Alex Dmitrios (Simon Abkarian), but M (Dame Judi Dench) is highly critical of Bond's lethal methodology--or at least its visibility on camera. Still, Bond's lead from the phone takes them to Dmitrios, who enjoys poker a bit too much for his own good. Bond takes advantage of this, winning his Aston Martin and seducing his wife (he claims his type is ""married""). Dmitrios, though, is an associate of Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) who orchestrates terrorist attacks to vary the value of stocks. When he attempts to take out the prototype Skyfleet plane to render their stock worthless, Bond catches on and defuses the situation. From here, Bond is set up with Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) from the treasury as ""the money"" and René Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini, who seems to have a habit of playing law enforcement officials) as contact and ally in Montenegro, where Le Chiffre is holding a poker game with very high stakes. Soon double crosses, the appearance of a CIA agent with similar aims (Felix Leiter, played by Jeffrey Wright), a poisoning, and a surprise declaration of love and subsequent resignation all follow. So, I guess the thing everyone's wondering is--did I like it? Yes, actually. I did. Quite a bit, in fact. I felt like this Bond was an actual secret agent--slicked by presence in film, but not to that cartoon strip level. When this Bond kills someone, you are very aware that it was a death, and not that sort of, ""Yeah, he got a bad guy!"" feeling older films have (and I get the impression the old Bond films did, though I don't know). It's tougher, it's more violent and Bond himself gets scratches and bruises. Craig's body is muscled but not heavily toned, showing a greater emphasis on the utility of exercise than the asthetics. His pride and arrogance is a sharp twinkle in his eyes, not the easy, smiling charm of a Sean Connery. It's not, admittedly, ""suave,"" but it's effective all the same, and perhaps a more believable draw. I find these things, at least in this context, very engaging. The plot rockets along from lead to lead as Bond follows them, visibly using resources and mental processing to track them, always aware of what's going on to a reasonable degree--never a feeling that he should have known better, unless it's the kind of feeling we all get in retrospect. Martin Campbell put together a very good film here, one that I think many have noted is a far cry from old Bonds, but many who actually have seen the others called the best, or one of the best. I certainly can't make any accurate statements to this effect, but I was more interested in a character that doesn't often wander around in suits and tuxedos with slicked back hair, and in one who has a clear history of SAS experience and the like, one I can accept has had the kind of training and experience that would make him good as a secret agent. I'm by no means claiming I have the ""right"" stance on this (certainly, the earlier films didn't aim to portray this kind of character and fail, they tried to portray a different kind of character), but rather that this is the kinda that's interesting to me. I'm often a little saddened or annoyed by the glossing of modern film, but this one managed a nice balance of its grit with the cleanness of it. The relationship between Vesper and Bond is acceptable, though it plays on that endless trope of immediate conflict that turns into romance, because there's chemistry between them and because you can see where the mutual respect comes from between them. Le Chiffre is a solid villain as he is arrogant and self-interested, but also lethal enough to back up his threats and his reputation. I don't know whether my divergence will remain with the films upcoming (though I've already seen <i>Quantum of Solace</i> and quite liked it, and will see it again soon then actually review it, gasp, despite it still being a new release), but I think I'll have even greater difficulty watching the older films now--I never could see Connery as a slick secret agent for some reason, or at least never found it interesting, and never really saw Moore, Brosnan, Lazenby or Dalton as interesting either. It's sort of the stereotype that sets me away from action films rather than pulling me into them--though I actually have no immediate aversion to them. I'm just more interested in that steely glare mixed with a stylish taste and walled off emotions than the cartoonish omni-suited gadget-man. It's, in my mind, sort of the difference between the sort of ""loose"" feeling of movies like <i>Dirty Harry</i> (as exemplified in my mind by the blood on Scorpio), that sort of feel of trying new things and not always having enough control over them, but at the same time throwing off boundaries left and right (hollow volcanoes? really?) and the contrasting feel of more modern action films like <i>Collateral</i>, a feeling I tend to be more interested in, though I usually find the former entertaining anyway. Oh, and an excellent title sequence does not let down a great history of them (I do know that much!), and the theme was inspiringly, heart-poundingly brilliant, despite only appearing at the end, and when he said his name, finally, in that immortal line, Craig made it more Bond's words than a ubiquitous catchphrase, quite an achievement, in my mind, when dealing with a line that ingrained in the public conscious. I like Craig's Bond, and, from my admittedly strange viewpoint, I feel that it's the best Bond, but more in the sense of treating the character in a realistic way than in a comparative one. It engages me and makes me want to see more--which clearly the other films never did for me.",positive
"Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery. I was a little hesitant to see it because i didn't know if he was going to be able to live up to Bond. He blew me away, as did the rest of the movie. (the torture scene sold it for me. what a man.)",positive
"I will admit, seeing Daniel Craig instead of Pierce Brosnan as Bond for the first time was very disconcerting. But Craig plays Bond sooo much better! Especially now that they've ditched that 40-year continuity thing. And look at his eyes next time you watch. They're freaking intense.",positive
"""Casino Royale"" is my favorite James Bond picture. It's classy, action packed, realistic, emotional, and well written. It features a near perfect balance of character development, mythology, action and mystery. What I like most about ""Casino Royale"" is how old fashioned it all feels. Plain and simple, one of the best spy films around featuring a standout performance from Daniel Craig.",positive
all hail the new bond - the gritty style of connery makes a come back,positive
he is hot! and the locations amazing,positive
mayb ethe best bond yet...sinster and dark,positive
"""Bond. James Bond."" I'm am perfectly enthusiastic to accept Daniel Craig as the new Bond.",positive
I dig the new bond... it needed an overhaul and I think the did it right,positive
Needs moar Sony electronics kthx,positive
Daniel Craig was so intense in this film. He is the best Bond. The movie is fast paced and all the actors are well-cast.,negative
"i loved it!! didn't think anyone else could be 007 cept brosnon, but i think this guy kicked so much more ass. i like him better than pierce brosnon actually. ps - the accountant was hotttttt hahaha why don't i know any acccountants like that??",positive
"Pretty good, still think they cast the wrong Bond though...this dude's way too old....and blonde!!!",positive
One of my favorites. One of the best Bond movies ever.,positive
"This movie is amazing beyond belief. Like most people, I was aprehensive when I heard that there was going to be another new Bond. But this one is by far the best of all the Bond flicks. Kudos for this one",positive
"finally a good james bond whos more than just a pretty face...with all the others it was hard to believe they would act so base and cold...well daniel craigs character was tough in a completely believable way, unlike the previous bonds",negative
"YES!! Finally, a bond movie without invisible cars and gadgets that can do everything! Daniel Craig truly brought back the old bonds back to life.",positive
I think this is a great james Bond movie... I think Daniel Craig did a great job playing James bond... Great Action to,positive
Finally a new Bond movie that doesn't suck. Daniel Craig does an amazing job as a young and cocky James Bond in this slightly too long espionage flick.,positive
My favorite 007 flick to date. Daniel Craig really shows that he deserves the 007 title despite all the negative opinions of him becoming the new 007 when he was first cast. He is believable as James Bond.. and probably the best bond after Connery. Besides Craig's acting.. the other positive thing is that Casino Royale showed that you dont need any super cheezy/unecessary CGI/special effects to make a movie work. All the action scenes were believeable and real.. with minimal CGI work done. Great movie.,positive
There is only one Bond. Craig is NOT it.,negative
"A step up from the latest Brosnan efforts, a step away from traditional 007 style, and a step down from Sean Connery's renditions.",positive
"Dude this is just... wow. I thought it woudl suck but it was really, really good.",positive
"Excellent. Daniel Craig expertly steps into the role he was born to play. I was a little apprehensive when I first found out that the new 007 was going to be a short guy with blonde hair and blue eyes. However, my worries were instantly dispelled as I saw Craig call upon the classic snarl that only Connery had been able to summon. This is a Bond that leaves behind all the gloss and gimmicks of the prior films, and starts from ground zero. The Bond makers have a hell of a task ahead of them in topping this, but for the first time in years, I can't wait to see them try.",positive
"One of the best, if not the best Bond film in the series. Character development! No more invisible cars! Also, Daniel Craig is a complete badass. Excellent.",positive
"I've always been a Connery fan and always will be when it comes to James Bond, but DAMN. Daniel Craig does portray that sort of limbo between James Bond and 007-James Bond. The cinematography was amazing, and I am absolutely in love with the opening sequence.",negative
"After watching it I felt pretty unsatisfied, but then they did say that Casino Royale was ""unfilmable"". Still some good actions sequences.",negative
Just like the books!,positive
Craig a revelation. Fantastic adaptation of what remains the best Bond novel.,positive
I think the only flaw this movie carries is that James didn't sleep with Dimitri's wife.,positive
"Craig is a good Bond, but I felt the script was not as good as it could have been. We can only hope the next is better.",negative
"I feel that bourne has put pressure on bond to give us this. Despite the face that Daniel Craig may not look like Bond, he clearly put his critics to rest by giving a very good performance as a gritty, tough and ruthless bond, true to the books!",positive
"one of the best bond movies. so what if daniel craig is blond, he's up there with sean connery.",positive
Very good. Easily the best Bond movie I've ever seen.,positive
"this bond is so cool; the movie is dark and gritty, a vast improvement from the last 'bond' film",negative
"Refreshing in a sense that Bond is no longer a super-human, and the movie's actually about the characters and not the gadgets for a change. This movie follows Ian Fleming's original novel pretty closely too ... not a bad movie.",negative
"Finally, a good Bond again! But what's with the poker?!? *sigh*",negative
"que sorpresa para un bond. me gusto mucho, muy sexy James. Un poco farragoso el final",positive
"Brings Bond back to his novel incarnation. Bond relies more on his wits and skill than his gadgets, and it works. Daniel Craig proves that Sean Connery isn't the only badass that can pull off a tux.",positive
an amazing adition to the 007 series. very good movie,positive
it good but wasnt it ment to be a bond film???????????,positive
There's nothing like a good action movie once in a while. And James Bond is just such a great character.,negative
My favorite Bond movie yet,positive
"I am a big fan of Pierce Brosnan, but Daniel Craig does a good job as JB.",positive
"Daniel Craig, blue shorts, wet body! Nuff said!",positive
god hes hot for an old guy,positive
"Great relaunch to the James Bond films! I do believe having no gadgets does take away from Bond, but it sort of gives you a glimpse into what exactly made James Bond the character that he became. Plus, the film gives a great launching pad to new films.",positive
Good gritty stuff. Nice to see James Bond with a bit of an edge.,positive
"not the best bond movie, but its good with lots of action.",positive
Saw it 3 times at the movie theatre Daniel Craig is the most magnificent Bond,positive
A Bond who can really strip naked and get whipped,positive
The film that successfully made a poker game interesting for an hour.,positive
Watched all the bonds and the new movies were really beginning to bore the hell out of me. This is a refreshing new start for a legendary franchise. I even dare to call it the best bond movie ever.,positive
"This has been the first bond film in a long time that was actually enjoyable to sit through. Daniel craig and Eva green both did a fine job, but I would attribute this films success for me to its better than usual action storyline. Not bad!",negative
"Was very skeptical going into the theatre, but very impressed",positive
Danil Craig is the best bond yet,positive
"Surprisingly good. Daniel Craig shows promise to fill Brosnan's large boots as Bond. I was a skeptic, but I enjoyed it thoroughly.",positive
"Before Daniel Craig, I thought I knew Bond. I've seen them all, I swear. I can play James Bond trivia. But this Bond is better, grittier, more human and more inhuman than any other. There are scenes here that cause any man to flinch. If you've seen it, you know the one I'm talking about. And yet, this is a Bond who makes mistakes and learns from them. The classic killer, as graceful and deadly as any shark.",positive
"An awesome Bond movie, especially after the direction Brosnan took it.",positive
"NOOOOOO!!! To the LEFT!!! (the best line, given the context, ever?)... excellent, cool, true bond - and NO silly invisible cars!",positive
"Best Bond, Best Bond Story",positive
la mejor de todas las de 007,positive
awesome movie! u gotta see it! my fave BOND movie,positive
One of the best action movies in a long time.,positive
Bond's best outing since the '60s and the best action film of recent memory.,positive
Was never a fan of Bond filmes...Mr Craig changed all that. Can't think why...,positive
Now that's what 007 should be. Loved the raw violence.,positive
One of the best Bonds ever.,positive
"For me,it's the best Bond movie. Daniel Craig......what can I say......",positive
The best Bond movie yet.,positive
"Definitely worth seeing, and Daniel Craig was excellent as a young, brash, Bond. The last half hour dragged a little though.",positive
I didnt know Bonds had to act.,negative
"Back to the old, Fleming style Bond films, but set in the modern era. Good film and no need for the wise cracks !",positive
"for entertainment's sake entirely. it was refreshingly different from the rest of the bond's. risky, but successful.",negative
"Mmmm, what can I say? This is the Bond movie for the women.",positive
"Great movie. Most of the previous ""James Bonds"" usually had a thing for sorting issues out using violence only but this guy mixes violence with brains and I like that.",positive
"It was a bit slow to start with,the action secenes are fab. Daniel Craig is fab as Bond",negative
actually a lot better than I was expecting.,positive
"Too long. Evertime I thought it was going to end, it kept going!! Enjoyed Daniel Craig.",negative
"Too many actions, I thought James Bond should rely more of its wits than its moves. I didn't know that it should be a recap of the 007's early life before getting into the theater.",negative
"Darker and dirtier, which is always nice.",negative
The best Bond movie ever!,positive
I like the adrenalised new Bond with the death defying stunts and the fast paced energetic chase sequences. Keep em' coming.,positive
"Great Movie, Totally different from the rest of the Bond movies. Finally, on this one, Bond does have the perfect or final result he wanted at the end. A must see!",positive
"Great action, loved Daniel Craig but...a little slow in parts.",positive
what a waste eva green dies at the end:'(,negative
"Woot. Happy and sad all in the same movie. Daniel Craig is great, but I love Eva Green.",positive
"I didn't mind them starting over if it meant doing some interesting things with early Bond, but the card game was more dull than engaging, Craig was too stiff during the romantic scenes and seeing real corpses, while part of an art display (Bodyworks), pulled me out of the fantasy.",negative
One of the best Bond films of all time and that came as quite a surprise to me.,positive
"Best Bond film yet. Truer to the original character of Bond as per the books. I had a bit of trouble briefly at first (intellectually) with the ""reboot"" concept, but in hindsight it made sense. I liked this Bond even better than Connery, Lazenby, Dalton, or Brosnan, and he (Daniel Craig) makes Roger Moore seem like a cheesy pale imitation (a la Mr. Bean only without the good comedy).",positive
"A bit meandering at times, but I liked the less polished Bond.",positive
"It's a good one, but not the best as they said to sell it well... The Ocean Club jokes are fine and MP's ""I'm the money"" & JB's ""Every penny of it"" are one of the best dialogues.",positive
"the era of a new james bond has started. Casino royale is a darker take on the original 007 story, which makes this movie a must see for any bond fan.",negative
My favorite Bond film. As real and cold-blooded as it gets with .007,positive
"not bad. i'm not a big James Bond fan, but it wasn't too bad, i guess...",negative
BEST BOND EVER! i love DC,positive
i can watch this over and over.,positive
Best Bond I've seen.,positive
"A plot that went on like a run-on sentence... just when you thought it was a good story, and was done, it'd hang onto a loose end. Good insight into ""Bond character history"" though.",negative
A great reboot of the franchise. Impressive.,positive
"I haven't really seen any other Bond movies, but I dug this. It had some bad-ass action, some ball torture and some ladies. I'd never seen Daniel Craig in anything before, but he seems like a bad ass. The only real problem was the over abundance of villains. Every time Bond would kill one another dude would show up. It was whack.",positive
Daniel Craig makes a great Bond!,positive
Opening chase scene is AMAZING!!!,negative
Action packed from the get-go! Different kind of Bond that seemed to use more brute force than brains. Great flic-want to see more.,positive
"the best james bond since sean connery (and maybe roger moore :)! funny, interesting and exciting.",positive
"Daniel Craig was really excellent as Bond and I really enjoyed seeing the beginnings of the Bond character. But there needed to be more action - or shorten the movie. The end definitely dragged, but overall I really enjoyed this one and look forward to more of Craig's Bond.",negative
Best Bond film in years,positive
Dan craig nailed it.,positive
"he may be a blonde bonds, but he is so good at it...",positive
bloody good bond. hes not connery but hes back to being a nasty bastard. shame about that bit near the end where things went all ott again.,negative
"I'm not a fan of bond-type movies, but this one was better than expected",negative
one of the best bond films i've ever seen.,positive
Such a beautiful man...reminds me of one of the greatest I know.,positive
well done. but i just don't like daniel craig as bond.,negative
REALLY good memories :),positive
Il est ou le rythme ? Que c'est mouuuuu !,negative
"I thought it was mediocre, Craig needs to develop the charm Connery had, although he does have Connery's darker side down quite well.",negative
One of the better action flicks I have seen lately. Daniel Craig brought a sort of clumsy air to the Bond character.,negative
"Daniel Craig was awesome, the cars were amazing, the movie...decent at best.",negative
Craig never will beat Connery,negative
"Best Bond movie, a great re-start to the franchise.",positive
Great. those people who said Craig didn't get Bond right are chimps.,positive
"The effect of bourne on bond was clear to see. Bond just has that edge of humour, especially when his balls are being bashed!",negative
i honestly enjoyed watching it. kinda makes me wanna try a vesper. lol. i'm glad that bond was played by Ian Flaming; i was getting pretty sick of seeing Brosnan in that role.,positive
Det är nog bland dom bättre bond filmerna jag har sett. (nu får man väl många imot mej förstår jag) :-),positive
"Overrated, but still the best Bond film since Golden Eye.",negative
best bond film yet i reckon,positive
I have never seen a Bond film before until this one and it didn't disappoint. Daniel Craig is the perfect Bond.,positive
"Some people weren't so sure about the cast change for the new Bond movie, but I think it was brilliant. Daniel Craig does a fantastic job as the bond, and yes...he is the first blond bond, but he still does as good a job as any other, possibly better. The movie moves in a different direction that a ""typical"" Bond movie and it creates its own identity. The story was excellent, and we get to see how Bond came to be. It does not follow the usual aspects of a Bond film, such as the exclusion of the special gadgets and characters like Q and Moneypenny, but it's entertaining nevertheless. This movie makes you think. All the other characters play their parts very well, and Eva Green does a nice job being the new Bond girl. The music was great once again, and the new intro scene was innovative and excellent. This is one of the best 007 films I've ever seen!",positive
"So I finally saw this, and I really liked it. I'm not a James Bond fan and didn't know what to expect, but I'd say Daniel Craig fills out the tuxedo very well. Good story, lots of action and a smoking hot leading man. That's what I call a good movie.",positive
Craig strikes the right note in playing a professional killer.,positive
Booooooooo if it wasnt for the unrealistc poker scene...this movie would of been the pits!!,negative
Captured the gritty beginning of normally polished Bond.,positive
"the best of the series! Craig's great debut in hollywood! Eva Green, a god given beauty! looking forward to her new films",positive
Some really unforgivably bad dialogue in an unforgivably soppy scene.,negative
Original was better. Sadly lacking,negative
"A really good action movie, but nothing compared to all the original Bond movies. Daniel Craig comes off as a pouty little girl sometimes but at others he really pushes through and does the Bond thing well.",negative
I wasn't impressed. I was lost most of the time and it was unrealistic to me.,negative
This movie added a new flavour to 007 - loved it !,positive
This movie lived uo toit's expectations!,positive
I think Daniel Craig is a very good James Bond.,positive
this was very good. by far the best bond n a few years! havnt warmed to any of bonds since Sean. but craig deffo gets the biscuit for the fittest body!,positive
The best James Bond ever.,positive
I didn't think Bond could be blond but this was the best 007 ever,positive
Best 007 movie Best actor since Sean Connery,positive
david craig rocks as bond,positive
"Full of action and Daniel Craig, always a winner.",positive
"Resourceful, tough, and relentless, this is the kind of Bond we haven't seen in years. No inviso-cars or silly gadgets. Almost R-Rated violence. Daniel Craig turned out to be perfectly cast. Judi Dench is back. Jason Bourne-worthy set pieces. What else could a 007 fan ask for?",positive
I really like Daniel Craig's Bond. It's what Connery would have done if he wasn't chewing the scenery.,positive
i watched about half of it but then i got bored of it. :D,positive
"Great new Bond, Daniel Craig is surprisingly fitting for the role.",positive
My favourite bond movie.,positive
"For some reason, I wasn't really paying attention to this movie. I suppose Daniel Craig doesn't give the classic Bond feel I'm used to, and so I wasn't all that hyped. They actually made a torture scene humorous, which was pretty new to me. It seemed vaguely rushed through the entire thing, though, even though it was 2 hours and 24 minutes long; it was like they were forgetting something: the core of James Bond. I'm not even that interested in talking about it. It didn't feel like a Bond movie, even though M was there. 3.9. Not good, not bad.",negative
"A great version of Bond...he's a badass. Also, the twist at the end is something I think noone sees coming.",positive
"I wasn't really a big Bond fan before this, but I am now! Finally someone has taken the character as seriously as Ian Fleming originally intended him to be: dangerous, cold, but fallible. More please.",positive
Not as good as Pierce Brosnan's Movies...,positive
Ladies? Want to see Daniel Craig get thwacked in the tockleys while tied naked to a chair? Then this is the film for you! Actually a pretty good film for a Bond flick. About time they had a James bond with some grunt.,negative
This Is what James Bond Was supposed to be about. A Government Thug.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
This is OO7. At last.,positive
"Daniel Craig's NOT the best looking bond. BUT..... he's the best after Sean Connery. No Q,no gadgets to save the day.... but this movie makes bond human. He gets hit, he bleeds. Definitely a Bond movie to rememebr.",positive
"Daniel Craig är en rasande stilig karl med plutmun i alla poser, men frågan är om inte Mads Mikkelsen som superhet superskurk sopar mattan med honom flera gånger om!",negative
Best Bond film since the Connery years.,positive
"yes his hairs not dark but my god is this bond back to his roots, a mean and moody bastard, right what he should be with a little soft side. Craig's up there with Sir Sean if he continues this into the next one",positive
Possible the best interpretation of Bond,positive
i was always a sucker for bond movies,positive
Best Bond since Sean Connery!,positive
this is how raw bond should be,positive
it is an actual story. which is why it doesn't give you a break in the middle. it felt like two movies. but it was worth it.,positive
"I don't understand the praise that this film has got. Bond is reduced to a pouting porn star. There is no chemistry between Bond and girl...we're meant to believe that he gives up 007 job for this? Clearly in need of therapy and a proper relationship with a woman. Utter crap. Awful film song, boring opening titles, No gadgets, franchise ruined. The best thing was the chase scene, but then it got stupid on a Crane (huh?) ... the car gave the best performance, but clearly not that gripping!",negative
"my personal fav. bond movie. daniel craig is a GREAT actor, and eva green is gorgeous.",positive
Daniel Craig is impressive as the new more hardcore version of the secret agent.,negative
What can I say?...Love Vesper and the way he eats...hmm sooo good!!,positive
I liked this more than any other James Bond film. And Daniel Craig is cute. :),positive
"Unevenly paced, and ends about four times. Still, much more acting than any Bond films since the first ones, with Connery. If you really like Daniel Craig, though, see him in just about anything else. Be warned - after the first fifteen minutes, nothing else in the movie is as exciting or interesting as what just happened.",negative
"This one is simple its the best James Bond ever, and it was needed the last few were stinkers.",positive
"Daniel Craig is good but... Sean Connery had a steeliness too, but with a glint more humour. Maybe Bond learns that armour later, but I still missed it. I liked that it had less gadgets and liked the intriguing nature of those they did have. I think Bond movies do have to be set in the past now - we've moved on.",negative
The best Bond film since Conner first donned the tuxt back in the sixties. Finally a James Bond that isn't stuck in the modes and tropes of the 60's.,negative
Definitely a great Bond film. One of the best. Daniel Craig is just as good as Connery.,positive
"He's cool, british, and 007. Need I say more?",positive
Blondes have more fun.,positive
"It's been a while since the last Bond movie. Daniel Craig is not the kind of guy I would picture as the next Bond, but he portrays the character well enough for me. Plenty of action and of course, beautiful women as always in any Bond film.",positive
"Surprise. Daniel Craig as Bond is better than any Bond movie with Brosnan. He has all the qualities of a real Bond, plus he is tougher like he's in the books. The story, the action makes this Bond movie to one of the best of the serie ever.",positive
Easily in my top 5 bond films.,positive
The best Bond movie made in the last 20 year's,negative
Too long but downright awesome. A fizzling franchise revived in extraordinary fashion.,positive
"I think that this is the best James Bond movie. It was action packed and highly entertaining and not sleezy like all the other recent Bond movies. Also, Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond.",positive
"By far, best bond movie until now. Craig's acting is a fresh breath of air. A more human and vulnerable Bond",positive
Best Bond ever...I never even liked Bond before this movie,positive
"Really cool, liked the action and plot twists. However, there just didn't seem to be enough of Bond's gadgets, and what happened to his BMW?? why is it Ford now? This first Daniel Craig as Bond was not bad, but I still think he's the worst of them all",negative
Bond.....is.....BACK!,positive
I DREAM about Daniel Craig. This movie is one of my all-time favourites. YUM!!,positive
this movie kicks as much ass as the connery and daltry bonds did.,positive
If it's 007's fist misson how come he has cell phones and DVD's???? good movie putting that aside,negative
the most believable (as far as I am concerned) of the Bond movies...I've never read the books so I do not know how it compares,negative
"The best James Bond film so far. The plot, and character development are not caste aside by the stupid gadgets that plague other Bond movies",positive
"Perhaps the best Bond ever, and certainly right up there with the first three, Casino Royale is a return to a gritty, fallible and very much human Bond, making a stark and much welcomed depature from the formulaic nonsense that plagued the Moore and...(read more) Brosnan eras.",positive
Without a doubt the best Bond movie ever.,positive
The best bond film in a long time! Not Sean Connery but the next best thing.,positive
"the best bond film yet. more edgy, slick, fresh, and cmon..holdem' again?",positive
Daniel Craig.. 2nd worst bond... no competition with Pierce he was the best...,negative
Great Bond movie. Action packed and Craig's not half bad looking!,positive
"somehow, a new Bond managed to be as good and even better that the older ones",positive
"aaaaawwwweeeesssooommmeeee ,best movie ever",positive
This movie ABSOLUTELY kicked ass!,positive
Best Bond since Sean Connery. (I say that like I know what I'm talking about... all I know is that it was way better than Brosnan's last movie.),positive
"I didn't think it was possible, but I have now watched this movie more times than The Lord of the Rings.",positive
"Wasn't sure how I was going to like a non-pierce-bronson Bond, but I really liked it. A more action, less-gadget-y movie.",positive
UHH ICPRES FILES MAYBE?,negative
fordi THE BEST BOND EVER,positive
"Daniel Craig makes one hell of a Bond!!! Most of Pierce Bronsan's movies revolved around hi-tech gadgets, but this one captures James Bond like it should!!!",positive
"I loved this movie and was among those who looked forward to see Daniel Craig as Bond. Craig has definitely become my favourite Bond after this with great acting, action and humour. I just hope he is not a one-hit wonder with 007. After watching Quantum of Solace he certainly is no one hit wonder but unfortunatly his second outing hardly lights the Bond franchise on fire but for me it does strengthen the quality seen here in Casino Royale. This film benefits from having, arguably, one of the strongest Bond girls ever in Vesper Lynd and you have quite a sinister and relevant villain in Le Chiffre. Casino Royale is my favourite Bond film and any future instalments must do a hell of a lot better than Quantum of Solace.",positive
"Great refresh of the Bond series. Best bond since the man himself, Sir Sean.",positive
Not bad at all. I like Daniel Craig.,negative
Was it really James Bond?,negative
A new bond in one of the best bond films. A shame the gadgets only make limited appearances.,positive
"I'm a huge James Bond film, I grew up with the Sean Connery offerings. This film is definitely one of the best. The gadgets which were becoming more and more ridiculous have gone and the film relies on action and story",positive
Best Bond ever made. Period. The only one with a plot besides action and sex.,positive
This was a great bond movie. It brought James bond into the 20th century and made him into a real pain feeling person person,positive
Daniel Craig will rock your socks. He's an awesome James Bond and this film totally restarts the series in a great way.,positive
lol what can I say just a well wortmovie to watch..,positive
"a very, very good film. the best Bond for ages",positive
Just watching this movie makes your testicles hurt.,positive
"Daniel Craig is the new Bond. I like Blond Bond, very much so. This movie is delicious.",positive
"The best Bond film ever, or at least since The Living Daylights.",positive
"And this, gentlemen, is how it's done! Watch and learn..",positive
"Confusing time line, but great film!",positive
"Daniel Craig, major hubba. Perfect Bond!",positive
"I loved this film, much grittier and more action than the other Bond films. Daniel Craig makes a surprisingly good Bond!",positive
I put this on expecting Roger Moore to reprise his role as The Saint but all I got was some bloke showing off his bollocks in his swimming trunks. Twat.,negative
Third best Bond film to date. It was a little more akin to some of the classic Bond films. Not overflowing with action like most of the Brosnan-era films were.,positive
only good thing in it is Daniel Craig and his shorts!,negative
The way Bond should be. A cold hearted killer.,positive
Best James Bond movie.,positive
not a big fan of james bond movies but this one is great!,positive
My first 007 movie I saw.,positive
I really liked this movie - definitely the best Bond in recent memory.,positive
Totally different than the other James Bond films,negative
"A James Bond movie set in the real world? It works for me! I kinda missed the obligatory scene with Q, but the more I think about it, the happier I am they avoided it.",positive
"Well, I liked Daniel Craig as James Bond a lot better than Pierce Brosnan. And that parkour-scene near the beginning made this movie worth while watching alone.",positive
"My favorite Bond movie so far. Love the more complete take on what makes Bond 'Bond'. Action was fun, more believable. The more Parkour stuff in movies, the better, I say.",positive
"I´imagine it is me rising from the surf. Bond with emotion and doubt. Touching, for a murderous bastard.",positive
Craig is arguably the best Bond since Sean Connery as this movie shows. He doesn't use sophisticated gadgets to fight his enemies; he just goes out and brawls. It wasn't too predictable either.,positive
"Finally! I don't want uber-gadgets or a plethora of women! I want the MI6 agent! And this is it! Best Bond film, and second best Bond actor after the ever-brilliant Connery.",positive
I am not a James Bond fan but I really like this one,positive
I'm not a huge Bond fan but wow this was good.,positive
Realy good movie good stuns,negative
"I prefer Pierce B. as Bond. To me, Craig didn't have the charm. I mean, clearly he is a fit fit man, but to me, he didn't have the suave-ness and charm as some Bonds before him.",negative
"Holy crap, I can't think of a reason not to give this 5 stars. Perfect Bond movie.",positive
Best Bond film to date.,positive
The Best James Bond movie EVER!,positive
"A little too clever in spots-- trying too hard to be the anti-Bond film. But Craig takes a great turn in the role and certainly brings an element of roughness and brutality to the role. I'm still a Brosnan fan, though.",positive
"This is Bond in a more realistic approach whitch is also supposed to be a closer interpretation of the character from the books. Daniel Craig played Bond flawlessly. Blonde hair and blue eyes aside he has every bit of charisma and charm Bond has. Now as for the film itself....To start out I must say that the movie dosn't start out with the Bond we all know and love. We begin as the film as he is just gaining his 007 status. This is one of the reasons why it's such an original approach to the Bond movies. He is evolving throughout the film and we find out why he treats women like possessions. The action is fantastic and the locations they used made every minute of the movie look crisp. As Mr. Lyle Horowitz mentioned, ""it is the ""Batman Begins"" of the Bond films"".",positive
"Not a big Bond fan, but this movie was AWESOME",positive
"Enjoyed watching M's (Dame Judi Dench) first scene (when she strode into a room with a colleague cussing), and the scene where Bond first met Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) on the train. Casino Royale is better than what you'd expect of a Bond film.",negative
the free running scene with sebastien foucan near the start was the only good part,negative
"No fancy gadgets, no big explosions (except for that kick ass opening sequence). But it's as awesome as any Bond ever made.",positive
possibly the best bond. so new and yet so classic,positive
"Craig portrays a more gritty bond. I likey, I likey alot.",positive
The hottest James Bond character ever-Daniel Craig!,negative
"Awesome action movie, lots of fisticuffs and light on the science fiction. Good fun!",positive
i LOVE james bond. and i love this movie. i think that daniel craig will make one of the best bonds ever...after coonery of course.,positive
"Normally, I don't give a shit about Bond movies. For me, the typical Bond is a cold-hearted bastard who relies heavily on gadgets and guns to do his job for him. This Bond, however, was vulnerable, quite the smart-ass (great lines), and didn't rely so much on guns and gadgets. Great change of pace. However, I think that the torture scene was a bit much.",negative
"I'd never liked James Bond movies,but it was totally different and really amusing.",positive
Loved. This. Movie. Daniel Craig became one of my favorite actors due to this performance.,positive
He was an amazing bond!! Thank goodness someone was there to fan me while I watched...thanks Liz!!!,positive
"Mmm Daniel Craig and Mads Mikkelsen! Nearly flawless, except two or three scenes, two of which I believe are because of Eva Green's intolerable acting.",positive
One of my favorites. Daniel Craig rules!,positive
"The best bond movie. Packed with intelligent action and thrilling suspense, it was a joy to watch, except for a particullarly painful torture scene.",positive
I had no idea a Bond movie could be this good. Fabulous. I fell in love with Daniel Craig.,positive
The best bond ever. Even tho my fav actor was roger moore for these movies.,positive
i would like to drive that aston,positive
The best bond movie ever period.,positive
Seen 'em all. Very smart presentation. Ready for the team's next feature.,negative
"Bond is back and niftier, gritter, creepier, funnier (has some of the best lines of any Bond) and gadgetier then ever. Let me tell you I did not have high expectations at all. I'm sure many didn't. I thought it would not only be the worst of the series, but a total rip off and defamer of it all. Unfortunatley, with the dark, caustic, spot-on opportune performance by Daniel Craig, Pierce Brosnan will go down as just another one of those ""comic"" bonds and not a complete one. Craig has it all, and when he fights, he brawls, no mercy, and no refs. You'll probably hate me for saying this, and I already feel the ""love"", but I believe this was a bit overrated. Was it good? More then that. Was it the best Bond? I dont know. It was flashy, dashy, mashy return undoubtedly. There is likely to be many more, and with its unique style, they're bound to be better. Craig is just on the rise of his career (anybody remember him from Tomb Raider?). To me, Brosnan is still the best, but the way this series has kicked off, its nothing short of riveting. Welcome back 007. The world is a bit more safe, now that the chicks ""playboy"" and smart guy is back in business. Don't call his cell; he'll just treat you like his waiter and ask for his martini, shaken not stirred. It's been a while now, and I have decided to take back my comment about this being overrated. I believe I was having an ""overrated seizure"" at the moment, and am not a very accurate first viewer of movies. After a few more views, I have retrieved the utmost appreciation for it and my whimsical ways (though next time I intend to underate my overrated blustery).This movie kicks ass, has Eva Green looking at her best, and is at the top of the Best Bond movies.",positive
"Who ever thought that a simple game of poker could be so intense? Well Daniel Craig fits Bond like a glove. This Bond film is more low-key, kinda like ""From Russia with Love"". Unlike the Pierce Brosnan films that made Bond very cold, idilic and almost super-human, Craig (and a great script) make Bond more of deeper person, like he's you and me. It's too soon to give this 5 out of 5 stars, but only time will tell.",positive
bond + poker = one righteous movie,positive
"I loved it -- and besides, it was the only James Bond movie which I liked.",positive
Good action movie. But NOT BOND.,negative
Daniel Craig = Fuckin' awesome.,positive
The best Bond film ever!,positive
All hail Daniel Craig! The best Bond film in years. Some would say it's the best full stop but I dunno if it can top Goldfinger or A View To A Kill for me!,positive
One of the best bond movies of all time... dan craig looks like a ruthless bond from the beginning.. 5 stars!!!,positive
THE best Bond yet. This film singlehandedly makes up for the Pierce Brosnon era.,positive
"guys want to be him, girls want to be with him - best bond ever",positive
"I hate to admit that someone may equal Connery, but Craig does the role justice indeed",positive
A great film that goes a little too long,positive
Two really big thumbs up!,positive
"gritty, brutal, instant classic",positive
"Finally, a James Bond that actually looks like he's got a pair",negative
"Fuckin' soccer hooligan bond runnin around chasing characters that are way cooler than himself, and then stopping to play poker for like half the movie, then watches his double-crossin skank not-girlfriend drown. Plus this movie was like twice as long as it needed to be.",negative
"It was suppossed to be the worst Bond, but he is the best!",positive
best bond since connery,positive
"One of the best Bond movies ever, Casino Royale will hold up as a classic.",positive
"The best Bond film in a long time, perhaps even ever. My only complaint is that it drags slightly towards the end.",positive
I always hated those stupid gadgets anyways.,negative
"One of my favorite Bond films, the free running sequence was super badass",positive
The best Bond there is.,positive
"For those of you who like to gamble! glamour, night of full action, fast cars, sexy people, beaches, exotic locations, good music don't miss it!",positive
"Great restart to the franchise. Exceptional acting from the new blond Bond, Craig!",positive
"Daniel Craig is probably the least handsome Bond, but this movie is damn pretty, with some gorgeous photography of a lot of incredible vistas and locations. The action is few and far between, but what is there is brutally sweet. A low-key Bond, but certainly one of the better ones compared to the heavy-handed Pierce Brosnan chapters. Worth watching for a fresher look at the classic franchise.",negative
"Hands down flat the best James Bond movie EVER made. It took them 60 years to get it right, but this is the best amalgamation of the novels and the films that have come before it. Daniel Craig is the ultimate James Bond, even surpassing Sean Connery by gifting the character with an immense sense of pathos. The very smart, emotionally charged and intelligent script is powerful and dynamic and Craig is supported by a remarkable and strong leading lady (Eva Green) as well as some bone-crunching, duck-behind-your-seats action sequences. This movie finally treats James Bond like a real, three-dimensional character and also turned me into a raving fan. The smartest and most superbly executed franchise reboot in movie history.",positive
"disappointed by all the overdone action, and the loss of james bond tease, courageous move for Craig to take the job.",negative
"Watched it on Blu-Ray and it was as good as I remember at the cinema. Great Bond movie. Actually, just a great movie.",positive
"Good action flick, but not a great Bond movie.",negative
En klar uppryckning från den usla Die Another Day. Lyckas ge Bond en ny tyngd (nåja!) utan att förlora humorn på vägen. Sannolikt bästa sen Roger Moore.,negative
they had this on the airplane on my way to my honeymoon! too bad it was boring and i stopped watching after 30 mns,negative
This isn't a bad way to spend a couple of hours. I like the new Bond.,negative
Daniel Craig challenges Connery for title of best Bond ever. Actually has a realistic premise and interesting plot.,positive
"Not a Bond movie, but still pretty good.",positive
Breathtaking action sequences and beautiful women...but...Craig takes himself way too serious. His Bond makes truly terrible errors in judgement...,positive
Fantastic. Best bond movie since the Connery glory Days. Craig shines as 007.,positive
"I think this was the best James Bond. What was that on James' face? Was that (gasp) a feeling??? Yep, I loves that icy Bond showed emotions while being a big macho guy. I loved the story that never ended and can't wait to see the new movie. Go Mr Craig!",positive
"Not a proper James Bond really, but an awesome film. Craig's mean and scary, not sure if he's smooth enough to play the classic Bond.",positive
"This being the only Bond movie I've seen all the way through, I can't compare it to the others. I actually liked how they made him a little vulnerable, and the action rocked!",negative
daniel craig reminds me of someone i knew a long time ago.,positive
Really great Bond movie. was a bit surprised by how long it was.,positive
"Bond is back! Dare I say it , the best Bond film since Goldfinger!",positive
probably one of my favorite Bond movies of all time,positive
"I don't like James Bond, and I particularly didn't like this one. The plot was unnecessarily contrived and too many scenes stretched believability too far. Worth seeing only for the Aston Martin scene.",negative
With Daniel Craig as 007 could there be a better movie.,positive
Finally a bond who can kick ass! I never saw Craig as Bond he just didnt look right but he did a top job! More Bond like this please!,positive
Best Bond movie ever.. Daniel craig is very hot..,positive
"I watched all the Bond movies, and personally, this one is my favorite!! Daniel Craig did a smashing job!",positive
"Una elección muy acertada la de elegir a Daniel Craig para encarnar al agente secreto británico más famoso. Este Bond es mucho más humano, más creíble (aunque al principio pega unos saltos que ni los X-Men). Me quedo con el nuevo Bond y su Casino Royale.",positive
Daniel Craig - enough said...,positive
Just for the short shorts...!!,negative
this movie is also spy movie.this is very nice.,positive
"it was above my expectation - Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond, next to Sean Connery",positive
"Really entertaining if you are a poker fan, but I'm not sure how entertaining it would be if you didnt care for poker at all. All in all a great movie because it doesn't have any over the top special effects or gadgetry. It's a more realistic spy movie than the other Bond movies.",positive
only a few words for this movie... New James Bond (Daniel Craig) Awesome choice!,positive
"The best Bond film ever, hands down. Craig outshines his predecessors in wit, looks, attitude, guts and credibility. Clever story with plenty action and a great score.",positive
didn't want to see it because i thought daniel craig was totally wrong as bond. what an exhilarating surprise!,positive
"this bond is the best. there, i've said it.",positive
freaking awesome. no q though,positive
Not to shabby. Good actor for Bond and some great poker showdowns. 1st chase scene was amazing.,negative
Can't tell who's who...,negative
Awesome stunts and sequences mixed with some intense poker. Daniel Craig makes a great 007. Story is quite interesting and there is an even more interesting torture sequence within...,positive
"""and everyone will know that u scratched my balls"" sorry had to open with that daniel craig is hot as a mo fo even if he is old enough to be my daddy. cuz i wish was. but it isnt nearly the best bond but i liked it alright.",negative
"My favorite Bond movie so far... Bond is back as a 3 dimensional character for the first time since OHMSS, and it feels great. The plot is terrific, Eva Green is beautiful, David Arnold's score is fantastic, and the action scenes are exhilarating.",positive
"Not really a bond fan, but I just watched this one and I'm thinking I need to go back and give some of the other bond films another try.",positive
"I hadn't seen many bond movies before this. After this, I hadn't seen nearly enough of them.",positive
"best bond movie to date, love Daniel Craig!",positive
"Great job of Daniel Craig, I wasn't sure he could do it. This is definitely one of the best Bond movies.",positive
"We used to own a spoof of the Bond movies, and it was called Casino Royale. This one is SO MUCH BETTER! This is the only Bond movie I'll ever watch, and Daniel Craig was AMAZING!",positive
Daniel Craig is the new ultimate Bond!,positive
"Sweet movie, thought the torture scene hurt just to watch it.",positive
favorite 007 behind goldeneye and goldfinger,positive
Daniel Craig begins a new era of Bond...the second movie will tell us more.,positive
best bond movie ever he has potential,positive
Wasn't that impressed with the new Bond or the movie in general.,negative
"this is how you do a proper prequel for a badass character, take notes george lucas",positive
"Blonde Bond. I like the change. He's still the old Bond, but he has his ruffian, inexperienced edge. Rough around the edges. Good stuff.",positive
"By far the best Bond to date, Daniel Craig kicked some royal ass. The action scenes were cool, the wit was there, the intrigue,... all-in-all a very cool movie.",positive
My personal Faveorite movie.,positive
This is the most wreckless I've ever seen 007. Really good.,positive
"though badass, the parkour chase sequence is way, way too long and reminds me of modern Bond in all of the worst ways. This movie is good, but only because it reminds me of the old stuff",negative
Finally a different James Bond! This is what ive been waiting for. A badass Russian looking Bond in action!,positive
I liked the new James Bond,positive
Comes a close second to Goldfinger but def one of the best modern JBs yet,negative
love this movie!!!! the only james bond movie i've seen. kinda makes me want to watch all the others.,positive
One of the best Bond movies I've ever seen.,positive
One of the best Bond Films ever made.,positive
Nice to see a Bond movie with an actual plot and some good acting.,positive
Best Bond ever! Wasn't a huge fan until seeing this movie. Best free-funning scene I've ever seen,positive
